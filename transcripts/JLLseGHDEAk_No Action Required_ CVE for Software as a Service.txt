Kind: captions Language: en Um, wait, no, no. On the way over here, Um, wait, no, no. On the way over here, Um, wait, no, no. On the way over here, I'm like, "Good. It's Friday." Like, no, I'm like, "Good. It's Friday." Like, no, I'm like, "Good. It's Friday." Like, no, no, no. Almost one day. Feels like it no, no. Almost one day. Feels like it no, no. Almost one day. Feels like it might be a Friday. Um, we're here to might be a Friday. Um, we're here to might be a Friday. Um, we're here to talk about talk about talk about uh CVEes uh CVEes uh CVEes that CVEEs that might not require action that CVEEs that might not require action that CVEEs that might not require action or at least not user action. Very often, or at least not user action. Very often, or at least not user action. Very often, this is probably because it's a cloud this is probably because it's a cloud this is probably because it's a cloud service vulnerability. Um, and uh, the service vulnerability. Um, and uh, the service vulnerability. Um, and uh, the good news is we're going to have people good news is we're going to have people good news is we're going to have people who actually work at cloud service who actually work at cloud service who actually work at cloud service providers talk about this and not me providers talk about this and not me providers talk about this and not me talk about what I think that they may or talk about what I think that they may or talk about what I think that they may or may not do. Just a couple slides for may not do. Just a couple slides for may not do. Just a couple slides for background to frame things up and we'll background to frame things up and we'll background to frame things up and we'll get over to the panel. So, this is not a get over to the panel. So, this is not a get over to the panel. So, this is not a surprise to anyone hopefully, but we're surprise to anyone hopefully, but we're surprise to anyone hopefully, but we're all here for sort of risk all here for sort of risk all here for sort of risk reduction management, vulnerability risk reduction management, vulnerability risk reduction management, vulnerability risk reduction, right? reduction, right? reduction, right? Um, you know, a lot of software as a Um, you know, a lot of software as a Um, you know, a lot of software as a service. the provider fixes it. It is service. the provider fixes it. It is service. the provider fixes it. It is almost instantaneously fixed for almost instantaneously fixed for almost instantaneously fixed for everyone. Little or no action ever everyone. Little or no action ever everyone. Little or no action ever required. It's great. It's much takes required. It's great. It's much takes required. It's great. It's much takes it's much faster than individually it's much faster than individually it's much faster than individually patching things and people having to do patching things and people having to do patching things and people having to do their own own patching work. So full their own own patching work. So full their own own patching work. So full acknowledgement that software as a acknowledgement that software as a acknowledgement that software as a service can be patched very very very service can be patched very very very service can be patched very very very quickly with awesome quickly with awesome quickly with awesome coverage. Um from a CVE point of view, coverage. Um from a CVE point of view, coverage. Um from a CVE point of view, the CVE CNA rules uh changed in August the CVE CNA rules uh changed in August the CVE CNA rules uh changed in August of 24 technically. Um, and there's a of 24 technically. Um, and there's a of 24 technically. Um, and there's a change between the 3 0 rules and the 40 change between the 3 0 rules and the 40 change between the 3 0 rules and the 40 rules. And that's sort of the the main rules. And that's sort of the the main rules. And that's sort of the the main point of our of our panel here today. Uh point of our of our panel here today. Uh point of our of our panel here today. Uh so the 3 0 rules and you can just look so the 3 0 rules and you can just look so the 3 0 rules and you can just look this this this up. There's um there's reasons for this up. There's um there's reasons for this up. There's um there's reasons for this but there's some slightly difficult but there's some slightly difficult but there's some slightly difficult logic to figure out here but the net logic to figure out here but the net logic to figure out here but the net result is if the result is if the result is if the CNA is the cloud service provider that CNA is the cloud service provider that CNA is the cloud service provider that CNA may assign a CVE ID and publish for CNA may assign a CVE ID and publish for CNA may assign a CVE ID and publish for that service. No one else in the program that service. No one else in the program that service. No one else in the program under the 30 rules can do that is under the 30 rules can do that is under the 30 rules can do that is authorized to publish. So the change to authorized to publish. So the change to authorized to publish. So the change to the 40 sorry to the 40 rules the 40 sorry to the 40 rules the 40 sorry to the 40 rules uh uh uh says um so should should publish and says um so should should publish and says um so should should publish and disclose um if it can cause significant disclose um if it can cause significant disclose um if it can cause significant harm and that's no further defined than harm and that's no further defined than harm and that's no further defined than the words significant harm or requires the words significant harm or requires the words significant harm or requires action or risk assessment or action by action or risk assessment or action by action or risk assessment or action by parties other than the CNA in question. parties other than the CNA in question. parties other than the CNA in question. So there's that So there's that So there's that guidance. Uh and the other guidance that guidance. Uh and the other guidance that guidance. Uh and the other guidance that go goes along with it is the CNA must go goes along with it is the CNA must go goes along with it is the CNA must not only consider the type of technology not only consider the type of technology not only consider the type of technology when deciding to assign or not. So I may when deciding to assign or not. So I may when deciding to assign or not. So I may have criteria about severity or some have criteria about severity or some have criteria about severity or some other reasons that causes me to assign other reasons that causes me to assign other reasons that causes me to assign or not assign. That's fair game. I'm not or not assign. That's fair game. I'm not or not assign. That's fair game. I'm not allowed to declare I shall never assign allowed to declare I shall never assign allowed to declare I shall never assign for cloud. I shall never assign for AI. for cloud. I shall never assign for AI. for cloud. I shall never assign for AI. I shall never assign for hardware. I shall never assign for hardware. I shall never assign for hardware. Whatever your choice of of tech is. The Whatever your choice of of tech is. The Whatever your choice of of tech is. The other addition here which is a little other addition here which is a little other addition here which is a little more tactical to the new rules is um more tactical to the new rules is um more tactical to the new rules is um there's a tag for the CVE record that is there's a tag for the CVE record that is there's a tag for the CVE record that is called exclusively hosted service and as called exclusively hosted service and as called exclusively hosted service and as you can see here this tag is used you can see here this tag is used you can see here this tag is used sometimes but only sometimes but only sometimes but only when everything in the record is only a when everything in the record is only a when everything in the record is only a hosted service. It's a pretty narrow hosted service. It's a pretty narrow hosted service. It's a pretty narrow definition and we're going to discuss definition and we're going to discuss definition and we're going to discuss that a bit today as well. So that's the that a bit today as well. So that's the that a bit today as well. So that's the that's the the framing for everything. that's the the framing for everything. that's the the framing for everything. Um there are some uh records in the Um there are some uh records in the Um there are some uh records in the database in the in the catalog that have database in the in the catalog that have database in the in the catalog that have used this tag either 61 or 51 depending used this tag either 61 or 51 depending used this tag either 61 or 51 depending how you count. That's a different talk how you count. That's a different talk how you count. That's a different talk earlier this week about quality and data earlier this week about quality and data earlier this week about quality and data and how you count things. Um but there and how you count things. Um but there and how you count things. Um but there are some some uh some CNAs who are using are some some uh some CNAs who are using are some some uh some CNAs who are using this tag in the corpus today. So that is this tag in the corpus today. So that is this tag in the corpus today. So that is the background. I'm going to stop with the background. I'm going to stop with the background. I'm going to stop with the presentation. I'm going to ask my the presentation. I'm going to ask my the presentation. I'm going to ask my esteemed panelists to introduce esteemed panelists to introduce esteemed panelists to introduce themselves, say where they're from, and themselves, say where they're from, and themselves, say where they're from, and give a bit of their background and sort give a bit of their background and sort give a bit of their background and sort of how they got to or why they care of how they got to or why they care of how they got to or why they care about uh CVE assignment particularly for about uh CVE assignment particularly for about uh CVE assignment particularly for cloud services. If it's okay, we'll just cloud services. If it's okay, we'll just cloud services. If it's okay, we'll just start with uh Mr. Beetle here and go start with uh Mr. Beetle here and go start with uh Mr. Beetle here and go down the line. Great. So, I'm Beetle, down the line. Great. So, I'm Beetle, down the line. Great. So, I'm Beetle, also known as Don Bailey. Don, sorry. Y also known as Don Bailey. Don, sorry. Y also known as Don Bailey. Don, sorry. Y I'm at AWS. I've been there for 15 I'm at AWS. I've been there for 15 I'm at AWS. I've been there for 15 years. I helped found the AWS security years. I helped found the AWS security years. I helped found the AWS security team. Before that, I was at the MITER team. Before that, I was at the MITER team. Before that, I was at the MITER Corporation. I have the dubious honor of Corporation. I have the dubious honor of Corporation. I have the dubious honor of being the intern who broke CVE before we being the intern who broke CVE before we being the intern who broke CVE before we launched it. Yay. Summer of launched it. Yay. Summer of launched it. Yay. Summer of 1999. And um good. I think um my biggest 1999. And um good. I think um my biggest 1999. And um good. I think um my biggest um participation point here is that um I um participation point here is that um I um participation point here is that um I wrote all of the security bulletins when wrote all of the security bulletins when wrote all of the security bulletins when I first started at Amazon. Um, we have a I first started at Amazon. Um, we have a I first started at Amazon. Um, we have a much larger team now and a framework and much larger team now and a framework and much larger team now and a framework and a process for doing that, but I'm still a process for doing that, but I'm still a process for doing that, but I'm still a point of escalation and certainly a point of escalation and certainly a point of escalation and certainly involved in uh, a lot of our discussions involved in uh, a lot of our discussions involved in uh, a lot of our discussions around CVE and how to apply it. around CVE and how to apply it. around CVE and how to apply it. Great, Michael. Yep. Great, Michael. Yep. Great, Michael. Yep. Hey, I'm Mike Cotay. I work at Google Hey, I'm Mike Cotay. I work at Google Hey, I'm Mike Cotay. I work at Google and I lead the Google bug bounty or like and I lead the Google bug bounty or like and I lead the Google bug bounty or like vulnerability awards program. Um, I vulnerability awards program. Um, I vulnerability awards program. Um, I really wasn't that involved in CVEEs really wasn't that involved in CVEEs really wasn't that involved in CVEEs honestly until about four months ago honestly until about four months ago honestly until about four months ago when we said we're going to start when we said we're going to start when we said we're going to start publishing CVES for all critical publishing CVES for all critical publishing CVES for all critical vulnerabilities in Google Cloud in which vulnerabilities in Google Cloud in which vulnerabilities in Google Cloud in which case my team started taking over. Uh, we case my team started taking over. Uh, we case my team started taking over. Uh, we do all the assessments and things of do all the assessments and things of do all the assessments and things of that before publication. Great Lisa. And that before publication. Great Lisa. And that before publication. Great Lisa. And I'm Lisa Olsen and I've been in the MSRC I'm Lisa Olsen and I've been in the MSRC I'm Lisa Olsen and I've been in the MSRC at Microsoft for 12 years now running at Microsoft for 12 years now running at Microsoft for 12 years now running Patch Tuesday. And uh I joined the CBE Patch Tuesday. And uh I joined the CBE Patch Tuesday. And uh I joined the CBE board in 2018. So I spend a lot of time board in 2018. So I spend a lot of time board in 2018. So I spend a lot of time thinking about CVEes and and reporting thinking about CVEes and and reporting thinking about CVEes and and reporting standards and that sort of stuff. Um I standards and that sort of stuff. Um I standards and that sort of stuff. Um I did participate in in the rules going did participate in in the rules going did participate in in the rules going from well actually uh I worked on the from well actually uh I worked on the from well actually uh I worked on the 3.0 rules and the 4.0 internal rules and 3.0 rules and the 4.0 internal rules and 3.0 rules and the 4.0 internal rules and and got uh Beetle involved both times and got uh Beetle involved both times and got uh Beetle involved both times and so so I drugg him to the meetings and so so I drugg him to the meetings and so so I drugg him to the meetings occasionally when we needed his help and occasionally when we needed his help and occasionally when we needed his help and his perspective. So um it's been a his perspective. So um it's been a his perspective. So um it's been a journey and it will continue on. I journey and it will continue on. I journey and it will continue on. I thought I was done with MITER. thought I was done with MITER. thought I was done with MITER. No one is ever done with um and I should No one is ever done with um and I should No one is ever done with um and I should actually Lisa bring something up. I'll actually Lisa bring something up. I'll actually Lisa bring something up. I'll I'll quickly just comment. Um this I'll quickly just comment. Um this I'll quickly just comment. Um this change from the 30 rules to the 40 change from the 30 rules to the 40 change from the 30 rules to the 40 rules, there was a lot of effort. I rules, there was a lot of effort. I rules, there was a lot of effort. I think we talked about this last year at think we talked about this last year at think we talked about this last year at Volcon. Um, but Lisa and a couple other Volcon. Um, but Lisa and a couple other Volcon. Um, but Lisa and a couple other people within the CV program did a lot people within the CV program did a lot people within the CV program did a lot of extra work on how to handle this of extra work on how to handle this of extra work on how to handle this cloud situation and I feel a little bit cloud situation and I feel a little bit cloud situation and I feel a little bit bad because they did all this work and bad because they did all this work and bad because they did all this work and we were word smithing the word cloud and we were word smithing the word cloud and we were word smithing the word cloud and how we were going to fit it in and then how we were going to fit it in and then how we were going to fit it in and then the conclusion was we're going to just the conclusion was we're going to just the conclusion was we're going to just take it out and just say you can assign take it out and just say you can assign take it out and just say you can assign for anything. So appreciate the effort for anything. So appreciate the effort for anything. So appreciate the effort and it led us to simplifying the rules and it led us to simplifying the rules and it led us to simplifying the rules in a way. Um, but a lot of extra work in a way. Um, but a lot of extra work in a way. Um, but a lot of extra work went into this. So thank you Lisa for went into this. So thank you Lisa for went into this. So thank you Lisa for your for your efforts there. Um, I'd your for your efforts there. Um, I'd your for your efforts there. Um, I'd also like to ask our panelists um, sort also like to ask our panelists um, sort also like to ask our panelists um, sort of just just for background, how how are of just just for background, how how are of just just for background, how how are your organizations handling CVE your organizations handling CVE your organizations handling CVE assignments for cloud vulnerabilities assignments for cloud vulnerabilities assignments for cloud vulnerabilities today? If you've got a exciting story, today? If you've got a exciting story, today? If you've got a exciting story, you want to do your whole process in you want to do your whole process in you want to do your whole process in three minutes, whatever, but let please three minutes, whatever, but let please three minutes, whatever, but let please tell us all what you're doing sort of tell us all what you're doing sort of tell us all what you're doing sort of actively and currently today. actively and currently today. actively and currently today. Uh, we'll just run down the line, I Uh, we'll just run down the line, I Uh, we'll just run down the line, I guess. Sure. Yeah. Yeah, please. guess. Sure. Yeah. Yeah, please. guess. Sure. Yeah. Yeah, please. So CV assignment is a is a natural So CV assignment is a is a natural So CV assignment is a is a natural process for us now as far as um our process for us now as far as um our process for us now as far as um our standard workflow for evaluating any standard workflow for evaluating any standard workflow for evaluating any number of different concerns whether number of different concerns whether number of different concerns whether they're internally discovered or they're internally discovered or they're internally discovered or externally reported. uh we have an externally reported. uh we have an externally reported. uh we have an intentional function where we step intentional function where we step intentional function where we step outside of the response process and outside of the response process and outside of the response process and determine whether or not um based on an determine whether or not um based on an determine whether or not um based on an analysis of the issue um CVSS scoring analysis of the issue um CVSS scoring analysis of the issue um CVSS scoring applied to it as well um but applied to it as well um but applied to it as well um but understanding whether or not um it understanding whether or not um it understanding whether or not um it qualifies under the current operational qualifies under the current operational qualifies under the current operational rules as requiring a CBE and um we have rules as requiring a CBE and um we have rules as requiring a CBE and um we have a team that's doing essentially double a team that's doing essentially double a team that's doing essentially double duty duty duty um previous sole function was um previous sole function was um previous sole function was vulnerability management and um vulnerability management and um vulnerability management and um assignment of any number of different assignment of any number of different assignment of any number of different scores or rescoring for environmental or scores or rescoring for environmental or scores or rescoring for environmental or temporal concern concerns for CVSS temporal concern concerns for CVSS temporal concern concerns for CVSS scoring purposes um and how we would scoring purposes um and how we would scoring purposes um and how we would drive you know certain issues. Um they drive you know certain issues. Um they drive you know certain issues. Um they have probably the largest expertise um have probably the largest expertise um have probably the largest expertise um within our org given the sheer volume within our org given the sheer volume within our org given the sheer volume and repetitiveness of having to do that. and repetitiveness of having to do that. and repetitiveness of having to do that. um if you're involved in vulnerability um if you're involved in vulnerability um if you're involved in vulnerability management, I praise you for your your management, I praise you for your your management, I praise you for your your ongoing efforts. Um and so um they're ongoing efforts. Um and so um they're ongoing efforts. Um and so um they're ticketed as part of the you know as you ticketed as part of the you know as you ticketed as part of the you know as you know dedicated ticketed as part of the know dedicated ticketed as part of the know dedicated ticketed as part of the process for evaluation of that. Uh it's process for evaluation of that. Uh it's process for evaluation of that. Uh it's yman's work in terms of you know making yman's work in terms of you know making yman's work in terms of you know making sure that they're able to do that in an sure that they're able to do that in an sure that they're able to do that in an efficient form and get back into efficient form and get back into efficient form and get back into essentially the you know the response essentially the you know the response essentially the you know the response process which in the case of an process which in the case of an process which in the case of an externally reported concern obviously externally reported concern obviously externally reported concern obviously involves coordinated vulnerability involves coordinated vulnerability involves coordinated vulnerability disclosure. um and um you know disclosure. um and um you know disclosure. um and um you know navigating essentially you know u navigating essentially you know u navigating essentially you know u release and announcement of those sort release and announcement of those sort release and announcement of those sort of things and then of course there's the of things and then of course there's the of things and then of course there's the logistics that we've been you know logistics that we've been you know logistics that we've been you know brought along you know through LISA in brought along you know through LISA in brought along you know through LISA in terms of understanding how to leverage terms of understanding how to leverage terms of understanding how to leverage um and and make sure that we properly um and and make sure that we properly um and and make sure that we properly populate the database entries that folks populate the database entries that folks populate the database entries that folks need and that's handled by that same need and that's handled by that same need and that's handled by that same team. So um largely a an extra logistics team. So um largely a an extra logistics team. So um largely a an extra logistics function for us but still part of our function for us but still part of our function for us but still part of our natural response process to any type of natural response process to any type of natural response process to any type of security concern that's either you know security concern that's either you know security concern that's either you know reported by a customer researcher or reported by a customer researcher or reported by a customer researcher or internally discovered by our own teams and I'll say clearly Google has been a and I'll say clearly Google has been a and I'll say clearly Google has been a CNA for years and years and years. CNA for years and years and years. CNA for years and years and years. Um when we launched our own internal Um when we launched our own internal Um when we launched our own internal cloud program uh basically the criteria cloud program uh basically the criteria cloud program uh basically the criteria is and it's internal criteria like we is and it's internal criteria like we is and it's internal criteria like we defined if it's critical then we must defined if it's critical then we must defined if it's critical then we must publish um again many of these are from publish um again many of these are from publish um again many of these are from uh researchers will ask for these and so uh researchers will ask for these and so uh researchers will ask for these and so it has to meet a minimum bar of like it has to meet a minimum bar of like it has to meet a minimum bar of like medium. So we just have a team that medium. So we just have a team that medium. So we just have a team that assesses every single potential critical assesses every single potential critical assesses every single potential critical vulnerability within cloud. um for vulnerability within cloud. um for vulnerability within cloud. um for impact and if it does then we'll impact and if it does then we'll impact and if it does then we'll generate CBSS scores and then just generate CBSS scores and then just generate CBSS scores and then just publish the the CVE but um yeah yeah yeah so somehow I think it was more so somehow I think it was more so somehow I think it was more complicated for us uh we have we have an complicated for us uh we have we have an complicated for us uh we have we have an incredible volume of of cases that come incredible volume of of cases that come incredible volume of of cases that come across our into MSRC from both internal across our into MSRC from both internal across our into MSRC from both internal and external researchers and it is hard and external researchers and it is hard and external researchers and it is hard to decide whether you're going to give a to decide whether you're going to give a to decide whether you're going to give a CBE. And so we tried before the rules CBE. And so we tried before the rules CBE. And so we tried before the rules went into place to come up with, you went into place to come up with, you went into place to come up with, you know, uh, decision trees and that sort know, uh, decision trees and that sort know, uh, decision trees and that sort of stuff. And it's it's still hard. of stuff. And it's it's still hard. of stuff. And it's it's still hard. Well, if it's on a web page on Well, if it's on a web page on Well, if it's on a web page on Microsoft.org and there's no login and Microsoft.org and there's no login and Microsoft.org and there's no login and but there's a crossite, you know, that but there's a crossite, you know, that but there's a crossite, you know, that we we we spent hours trying to figure it we we we spent hours trying to figure it we we we spent hours trying to figure it out. Um, but then when we actually out. Um, but then when we actually out. Um, but then when we actually started doing it, it it became a little started doing it, it it became a little started doing it, it it became a little bit more obvious what we should assign bit more obvious what we should assign bit more obvious what we should assign for and what we should not assign for. for and what we should not assign for. for and what we should not assign for. But I have to disagree with Art a little But I have to disagree with Art a little But I have to disagree with Art a little bit in that um cloud vulnerabilities bit in that um cloud vulnerabilities bit in that um cloud vulnerabilities aren't fixed in an instant. They they aren't fixed in an instant. They they aren't fixed in an instant. They they have to be rolled out. They have to be have to be rolled out. They have to be have to be rolled out. They have to be deployed. They have to, you know, go to deployed. They have to, you know, go to deployed. They have to, you know, go to to all the clouds that are affected. to all the clouds that are affected. to all the clouds that are affected. That it's a lot of work. And That it's a lot of work. And That it's a lot of work. And and what I tell people that are saying, and what I tell people that are saying, and what I tell people that are saying, "Okay, Lisa, let's assign for this," I "Okay, Lisa, let's assign for this," I "Okay, Lisa, let's assign for this," I say, "Okay, that's fine, but let's make say, "Okay, that's fine, but let's make say, "Okay, that's fine, but let's make sure that everybody is protected, like sure that everybody is protected, like sure that everybody is protected, like every customer is protected before we we every customer is protected before we we every customer is protected before we we disclose this vulnerability." And so disclose this vulnerability." And so disclose this vulnerability." And so that's a real criteria. The second that's a real criteria. The second that's a real criteria. The second criteria that I found that we didn't criteria that I found that we didn't criteria that I found that we didn't anticipate before actually getting into anticipate before actually getting into anticipate before actually getting into it was people who come to me and say, it was people who come to me and say, it was people who come to me and say, "Okay, we're going to assign for this "Okay, we're going to assign for this "Okay, we're going to assign for this vulnerability." And I say, "Okay, what's vulnerability." And I say, "Okay, what's vulnerability." And I say, "Okay, what's the product?" And they say, "It's not the product?" And they say, "It's not the product?" And they say, "It's not really a product." I said, "Can you give really a product." I said, "Can you give really a product." I said, "Can you give it a name? Anything that a customer it a name? Anything that a customer it a name? Anything that a customer would recognize?" Well, no, not really. would recognize?" Well, no, not really. would recognize?" Well, no, not really. I said, "Well, like, okay, if we can't I said, "Well, like, okay, if we can't I said, "Well, like, okay, if we can't name it, we can't give it a CBE because name it, we can't give it a CBE because name it, we can't give it a CBE because we have to we have to tell people we have to we have to tell people we have to we have to tell people something. So if there's really no name something. So if there's really no name something. So if there's really no name for it, it's buried that deep that for it, it's buried that deep that for it, it's buried that deep that nobody is nobody is nobody is ever going to recognize it, then let's ever going to recognize it, then let's ever going to recognize it, then let's not give it a CVE. Will that change? not give it a CVE. Will that change? not give it a CVE. Will that change? Maybe. Maybe. Um, it is. We're kind of Maybe. Maybe. Um, it is. We're kind of Maybe. Maybe. Um, it is. We're kind of breaking new ground and we have to breaking new ground and we have to breaking new ground and we have to figure it out and try to do our best, figure it out and try to do our best, figure it out and try to do our best, but it's not straightforward, I don't but it's not straightforward, I don't but it's not straightforward, I don't think. think. think. So let the record show that 14 minutes So let the record show that 14 minutes So let the record show that 14 minutes into the talk the software naming into the talk the software naming into the talk the software naming problem has has uh distracted us and uh problem has has uh distracted us and uh problem has has uh distracted us and uh is remains unsolved and really hard to is remains unsolved and really hard to is remains unsolved and really hard to do. So do. So do. So okay. Yeah. Exactly. There you have give okay. Yeah. Exactly. There you have give okay. Yeah. Exactly. There you have give us a CPE for that deeply embedded us a CPE for that deeply embedded us a CPE for that deeply embedded internal component that doesn't have a internal component that doesn't have a internal component that doesn't have a name. Yeah. name. Yeah. name. Yeah. Um so actually and and part of your Um so actually and and part of your Um so actually and and part of your response also Lisa reminds me um you response also Lisa reminds me um you response also Lisa reminds me um you know we have the title of our talk is no know we have the title of our talk is no know we have the title of our talk is no action and I'm over here thinking hey action and I'm over here thinking hey action and I'm over here thinking hey it's great I do nothing I refresh my it's great I do nothing I refresh my it's great I do nothing I refresh my browser page in Outlook online or Gmail browser page in Outlook online or Gmail browser page in Outlook online or Gmail or something is just more secure because or something is just more secure because or something is just more secure because I just didn't do anything overnight and I just didn't do anything overnight and I just didn't do anything overnight and a bunch of people did some work and they a bunch of people did some work and they a bunch of people did some work and they clicked a button and instantaneous you clicked a button and instantaneous you clicked a button and instantaneous you know protection everywhere. Um but it's know protection everywhere. Um but it's know protection everywhere. Um but it's not that even on the provider side, but not that even on the provider side, but not that even on the provider side, but also no action. It's not always no also no action. It's not always no also no action. It's not always no action maybe. So um thoughts on, you action maybe. So um thoughts on, you action maybe. So um thoughts on, you know, could we could we delve into that know, could we could we delve into that know, could we could we delve into that a little bit? What what does no action a little bit? What what does no action a little bit? What what does no action really mean? Maybe sometimes there is really mean? Maybe sometimes there is really mean? Maybe sometimes there is action that a a user a customer would action that a a user a customer would action that a a user a customer would want to do or have to do and and how do want to do or have to do and and how do want to do or have to do and and how do you all support that through um CVE you all support that through um CVE you all support that through um CVE assignments or other responses to to assignments or other responses to to assignments or other responses to to cloud vulnerabilities? cloud vulnerabilities? cloud vulnerabilities? Yeah, please. Yeah. Yeah, please. Yeah. Yeah, please. Yeah. perspective. When we say no action perspective. When we say no action perspective. When we say no action required, we mean full stop. No action required, we mean full stop. No action required, we mean full stop. No action required. The customer or our customers required. The customer or our customers required. The customer or our customers have to do absolutely nothing. Don't have to do absolutely nothing. Don't have to do absolutely nothing. Don't have to pick up a new version. It's have to pick up a new version. It's have to pick up a new version. It's automatically going to be rolled out to automatically going to be rolled out to automatically going to be rolled out to through whatever normal rollout process through whatever normal rollout process through whatever normal rollout process we have to everybody. What about What about What about So, hold on, hold on, hold on. What So, hold on, hold on, hold on. What So, hold on, hold on, hold on. What about incident response, right? Like about incident response, right? Like about incident response, right? Like what if but what Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. what if but what Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. what if but what Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. All right. All right. So, yeah. Sorry. I All right. All right. So, yeah. Sorry. I All right. All right. So, yeah. Sorry. I I I messed up the logistics. I I I messed up the logistics. I I I messed up the logistics. I apologize. We're going to leave. We're apologize. We're going to leave. We're apologize. We're going to leave. We're We are leaving at least 15 minutes for We are leaving at least 15 minutes for We are leaving at least 15 minutes for time. Please queue up your questions time. Please queue up your questions time. Please queue up your questions just for efficiency. I don't We can do just for efficiency. I don't We can do just for efficiency. I don't We can do in the middle. Yeah. All right. Well, in the middle. Yeah. All right. Well, in the middle. Yeah. All right. Well, fine. That's all good. But yes, use the fine. That's all good. But yes, use the fine. That's all good. But yes, use the mic. People are in outer space on the mic. People are in outer space on the mic. People are in outer space on the phone, so we need to um uh repeat phone, so we need to um uh repeat phone, so we need to um uh repeat questions or or ask them. But the last questions or or ask them. But the last questions or or ask them. But the last point I'll make is that when we do point I'll make is that when we do point I'll make is that when we do require action, we are very specific require action, we are very specific require action, we are very specific about like we try and be specific to the about like we try and be specific to the about like we try and be specific to the like the project and send out emails and like the project and send out emails and like the project and send out emails and send out security bulletins and do all send out security bulletins and do all send out security bulletins and do all these other things when we are we are these other things when we are we are these other things when we are we are asking them they either requiring when asking them they either requiring when asking them they either requiring when like you have a deadline March 31st at like you have a deadline March 31st at like you have a deadline March 31st at which point your workflows will break or which point your workflows will break or which point your workflows will break or um you know sometimes we can't fix it um you know sometimes we can't fix it um you know sometimes we can't fix it underneath them and it'll just like you underneath them and it'll just like you underneath them and it'll just like you you should be moving to the new new you should be moving to the new new you should be moving to the new new versions. Yeah. So to to your point um and we like Yeah. So to to your point um and we like Yeah. So to to your point um and we like to heir on the side of if we believe to heir on the side of if we believe to heir on the side of if we believe that there's a risk assessment that that there's a risk assessment that that there's a risk assessment that still has to be performed by the still has to be performed by the still has to be performed by the customer within their own environments customer within their own environments customer within their own environments from logs that they would have whether from logs that they would have whether from logs that they would have whether it's cloud trail in the case of it's cloud trail in the case of it's cloud trail in the case of AWS uh cloudatch logs if they're AWS uh cloudatch logs if they're AWS uh cloudatch logs if they're associated with an application associated with an application associated with an application um maybe something else that they've got um maybe something else that they've got um maybe something else that they've got custom uh and they've been you know been custom uh and they've been you know been custom uh and they've been you know been paying attention to that particular paying attention to that particular paying attention to that particular resource then uh we like to air on the resource then uh we like to air on the resource then uh we like to air on the side of caution in issuing a CVE side of caution in issuing a CVE side of caution in issuing a CVE specifically because um we believe that specifically because um we believe that specifically because um we believe that you know it's no action required. It'll you know it's no action required. It'll you know it's no action required. It'll say that within the CVE itself or with say that within the CVE itself or with say that within the CVE itself or with the at least within the security the at least within the security the at least within the security bulletin um but at the same time there's bulletin um but at the same time there's bulletin um but at the same time there's a risk assessment process that a a risk assessment process that a a risk assessment process that a customer might um you know have to take customer might um you know have to take customer might um you know have to take on. We call it customer agency um you on. We call it customer agency um you on. We call it customer agency um you know from our perspective um does the know from our perspective um does the know from our perspective um does the issue have effectively customer agency issue have effectively customer agency issue have effectively customer agency and um and that doesn't necessarily end and um and that doesn't necessarily end and um and that doesn't necessarily end at you have to upgrade to version at you have to upgrade to version at you have to upgrade to version whatever of some type of you know thick whatever of some type of you know thick whatever of some type of you know thick client that's on your side. we think it client that's on your side. we think it client that's on your side. we think it may involve incident response actions. may involve incident response actions. may involve incident response actions. So that really begs the question of like So that really begs the question of like So that really begs the question of like is there is there an existence of a real is there is there an existence of a real is there is there an existence of a real no action required CBE um in in our no action required CBE um in in our no action required CBE um in in our world um of a CNA and where we feel world um of a CNA and where we feel world um of a CNA and where we feel responsible for you know tying those responsible for you know tying those responsible for you know tying those numbers to security bulletins um maybe numbers to security bulletins um maybe numbers to security bulletins um maybe but it's it's going to be in the realm but it's it's going to be in the realm but it's it's going to be in the realm of um there's no resource for a customer of um there's no resource for a customer of um there's no resource for a customer to go and look at and it's associated to go and look at and it's associated to go and look at and it's associated with you know a documented or public with you know a documented or public with you know a documented or public vulnerability that they have a concern vulnerability that they have a concern vulnerability that they have a concern for and they want to have effectively a for and they want to have effectively a for and they want to have effectively a number that they can reference which you number that they can reference which you number that they can reference which you know may not necessarily be useful but know may not necessarily be useful but know may not necessarily be useful but uh at least you know stands for a uh at least you know stands for a uh at least you know stands for a purpose of documenting that particular purpose of documenting that particular purpose of documenting that particular event. event. event. I also think that that over time as the I also think that that over time as the I also think that that over time as the numbers of these things grow from 51 or numbers of these things grow from 51 or numbers of these things grow from 51 or 61 to something more substantial that 61 to something more substantial that 61 to something more substantial that that it's you know if we're enhancing that it's you know if we're enhancing that it's you know if we're enhancing our CBES with CWEs and CVSS that that our CBES with CWEs and CVSS that that our CBES with CWEs and CVSS that that there's research to be done and there's research to be done and there's research to be done and education to be gained. So, I I think education to be gained. So, I I think education to be gained. So, I I think um in order for our industry to get um in order for our industry to get um in order for our industry to get safer, we need to be more transparent safer, we need to be more transparent safer, we need to be more transparent and help each other. That's the only way and help each other. That's the only way and help each other. That's the only way that we're going to we're going to try that we're going to we're going to try that we're going to we're going to try to make it better. So, to make it better. So, to make it better. So, um there is action on the back end, I um there is action on the back end, I um there is action on the back end, I guess, in a in a sort of consolidated guess, in a in a sort of consolidated guess, in a in a sort of consolidated way. way. way. um do I I don't I don't know what the um do I I don't I don't know what the um do I I don't I don't know what the current sort of state of cloud current sort of state of cloud current sort of state of cloud um service provider regulation um service provider regulation um service provider regulation compliance issues are. I'm familiar with compliance issues are. I'm familiar with compliance issues are. I'm familiar with Fed Ramp on the US federal mostly Fed Ramp on the US federal mostly Fed Ramp on the US federal mostly civilian side. Are there um are there civilian side. Are there um are there civilian side. Are there um are there regulatory environments that affect uh regulatory environments that affect uh regulatory environments that affect uh your assignments for for cloud issues at your assignments for for cloud issues at your assignments for for cloud issues at all or what if any how much of a factor all or what if any how much of a factor all or what if any how much of a factor are are those? are are those? are are those? Yeah. No, so for you know for AWS we Yeah. No, so for you know for AWS we Yeah. No, so for you know for AWS we have a number of different compliance have a number of different compliance have a number of different compliance regimes that we have to you know be regimes that we have to you know be regimes that we have to you know be compliant with. Um we kind of separate compliant with. Um we kind of separate compliant with. Um we kind of separate that from security itself compliance. that from security itself compliance. that from security itself compliance. Um, so there could be, you know, there Um, so there could be, you know, there Um, so there could be, you know, there could be an event that occurs specific could be an event that occurs specific could be an event that occurs specific to a customer within those compliance to a customer within those compliance to a customer within those compliance regimes that has a reporting regimes that has a reporting regimes that has a reporting requirement. And so you have to comply requirement. And so you have to comply requirement. And so you have to comply with that and you make sure that you with that and you make sure that you with that and you make sure that you notify them of that particular, you notify them of that particular, you notify them of that particular, you know, event. Um, which could be a subset know, event. Um, which could be a subset know, event. Um, which could be a subset of a security bulletin or issue that of a security bulletin or issue that of a security bulletin or issue that happens to have a CVE associated with it happens to have a CVE associated with it happens to have a CVE associated with it or it could be completely separate. And or it could be completely separate. And or it could be completely separate. And so um from the standpoint of the so um from the standpoint of the so um from the standpoint of the intersection there's there's nothing intersection there's there's nothing intersection there's there's nothing that's necessarily mandating um you know that's necessarily mandating um you know that's necessarily mandating um you know from a government perspective the CVE from a government perspective the CVE from a government perspective the CVE assignment but there could be things assignment but there could be things assignment but there could be things from a government or a particular from a government or a particular from a government or a particular compliance regime that mandates um compliance regime that mandates um compliance regime that mandates um direct and independent reporting whether direct and independent reporting whether direct and independent reporting whether or not that occurs before CVE issuance or not that occurs before CVE issuance or not that occurs before CVE issuance if it is associated with an issue that if it is associated with an issue that if it is associated with an issue that may warrant a CVE that's something you may warrant a CVE that's something you may warrant a CVE that's something you end up having to navigate in the CVD end up having to navigate in the CVD end up having to navigate in the CVD process which can be as you process which can be as you process which can be as you complex. complex. complex. No, no, no, no, no. It's like that's No, no, no, no, no. It's like that's No, no, no, no, no. It's like that's basically how we is do it as well. basically how we is do it as well. basically how we is do it as well. Please do so. Okay, Google Google ag Please do so. Okay, Google Google ag Please do so. Okay, Google Google ag Google agrees. Um, so um you mentioned CVD and Um, so um you mentioned CVD and Um, so um you mentioned CVD and sometimes it goes great, the other 78% sometimes it goes great, the other 78% sometimes it goes great, the other 78% of the time it goes less than great. And of the time it goes less than great. And of the time it goes less than great. And I'm sure there's some distribution I'm sure there's some distribution I'm sure there's some distribution somewhere and everyone has their somewhere and everyone has their somewhere and everyone has their experiences. experiences. experiences. Um, not the only part of CVD, but it's Um, not the only part of CVD, but it's Um, not the only part of CVD, but it's pretty common. Hey, I've reported pretty common. Hey, I've reported pretty common. Hey, I've reported something. Hey, we're working on it. It something. Hey, we're working on it. It something. Hey, we're working on it. It meets a bug bar. It meets a severity meets a bug bar. It meets a severity meets a bug bar. It meets a severity level. Uh, it meets the rules. Um, I'd level. Uh, it meets the rules. Um, I'd level. Uh, it meets the rules. Um, I'd like a CVE for my for my thing. Uh, and like a CVE for my for my thing. Uh, and like a CVE for my for my thing. Uh, and it's a cloud thing. So, have you had it's a cloud thing. So, have you had it's a cloud thing. So, have you had experiences and how have they gone with experiences and how have they gone with experiences and how have they gone with the right maybe external request? I I the right maybe external request? I I the right maybe external request? I I heard everyone say external request for heard everyone say external request for heard everyone say external request for something, external report is is a is a something, external report is is a is a something, external report is is a is a criteria by which you know there might criteria by which you know there might criteria by which you know there might be a greater chance of publishing and be a greater chance of publishing and be a greater chance of publishing and maybe an assignment. But um what maybe an assignment. But um what maybe an assignment. But um what successes or difficulties have you had successes or difficulties have you had successes or difficulties have you had with CVD reporting for cloud with CVD reporting for cloud with CVD reporting for cloud vulnerabilities and the CVE assignments vulnerabilities and the CVE assignments vulnerabilities and the CVE assignments or discussions for for cloud or discussions for for cloud or discussions for for cloud vulnerabilities? vulnerabilities? vulnerabilities? Yeah, I think for the purposes of CVE Yeah, I think for the purposes of CVE Yeah, I think for the purposes of CVE assignment um for you know an issue assignment um for you know an issue assignment um for you know an issue that's reported to us and let's say it's that's reported to us and let's say it's that's reported to us and let's say it's you know it's intended to be blogged you know it's intended to be blogged you know it's intended to be blogged about but it may not necessarily have about but it may not necessarily have about but it may not necessarily have customer action. If it's medium or customer action. If it's medium or customer action. If it's medium or higher and it's going to be public then higher and it's going to be public then higher and it's going to be public then according to the rules we're going to according to the rules we're going to according to the rules we're going to assign a CVE for it as well. Um it gets assign a CVE for it as well. Um it gets assign a CVE for it as well. Um it gets interesting when you have um two issues interesting when you have um two issues interesting when you have um two issues that are reported and by the same you that are reported and by the same you that are reported and by the same you know by the by the same individual. Uh, know by the by the same individual. Uh, know by the by the same individual. Uh, I just ran across this not too recently. I just ran across this not too recently. I just ran across this not too recently. And one of those issues warrants CVE And one of those issues warrants CVE And one of those issues warrants CVE assignment, the other doesn't through assignment, the other doesn't through assignment, the other doesn't through your process. And so they end up your process. And so they end up your process. And so they end up publishing a blog post that says, I got publishing a blog post that says, I got publishing a blog post that says, I got a CV for this issue, but I didn't get it a CV for this issue, but I didn't get it a CV for this issue, but I didn't get it for the other one. And it looks a little for the other one. And it looks a little for the other one. And it looks a little awkward, but both of the issues are awkward, but both of the issues are awkward, but both of the issues are documented and they're out there. Um, so documented and they're out there. Um, so documented and they're out there. Um, so there's, you know, you just you navigate there's, you know, you just you navigate there's, you know, you just you navigate it. you're trying to like um apply it. you're trying to like um apply it. you're trying to like um apply essentially a rubric and do it essentially a rubric and do it essentially a rubric and do it consistently because once you start sort consistently because once you start sort consistently because once you start sort of like coloring outside the lines of of like coloring outside the lines of of like coloring outside the lines of the rubric now you're you know now the rubric now you're you know now the rubric now you're you know now you're causing those inconsistencies and you're causing those inconsistencies and you're causing those inconsistencies and somebody wants you know something you somebody wants you know something you somebody wants you know something you know for a particular situation and you know for a particular situation and you know for a particular situation and you have to explain to them it's like well have to explain to them it's like well have to explain to them it's like well if we do that once we're setting a if we do that once we're setting a if we do that once we're setting a precedent and now we're going to have to precedent and now we're going to have to precedent and now we're going to have to start doing that consistently as we go start doing that consistently as we go start doing that consistently as we go forward. Um doesn't mean that we're not forward. Um doesn't mean that we're not forward. Um doesn't mean that we're not going to revisit that rubric. So like we going to revisit that rubric. So like we going to revisit that rubric. So like we have our our scope. It's actually, you have our our scope. It's actually, you have our our scope. It's actually, you know, it's published. You go to our know, it's published. You go to our know, it's published. You go to our vulnerability reporting page, we tell vulnerability reporting page, we tell vulnerability reporting page, we tell you it's like if it meets this criteria, you it's like if it meets this criteria, you it's like if it meets this criteria, it's getting a CVE. Um, and if it it's getting a CVE. Um, and if it it's getting a CVE. Um, and if it doesn't, um, you know, you have a doesn't, um, you know, you have a doesn't, um, you know, you have a dispute process you can go through. Um, dispute process you can go through. Um, dispute process you can go through. Um, and that's that's well documented as and that's that's well documented as and that's that's well documented as well. Um, but of course part of that well. Um, but of course part of that well. Um, but of course part of that dispute process in a CNA of last resort dispute process in a CNA of last resort dispute process in a CNA of last resort or MITER itself ends up looking at or MITER itself ends up looking at or MITER itself ends up looking at essentially the published scope and if essentially the published scope and if essentially the published scope and if it conforms with the scope and MITER it conforms with the scope and MITER it conforms with the scope and MITER agrees then this it's not going to get a agrees then this it's not going to get a agrees then this it's not going to get a CVE and it's not about keeping people CVE and it's not about keeping people CVE and it's not about keeping people from getting recognition for their from getting recognition for their from getting recognition for their efforts. In fact, I think it's more efforts. In fact, I think it's more efforts. In fact, I think it's more important to provide the recognition important to provide the recognition important to provide the recognition than it is for a number but somebody than it is for a number but somebody than it is for a number but somebody ties a lot of that recognition or ties a lot of that recognition or ties a lot of that recognition or self-worth to those numbers. And so you self-worth to those numbers. And so you self-worth to those numbers. And so you have to you have to still sort of weigh have to you have to still sort of weigh have to you have to still sort of weigh that and be considerate of it when you that and be considerate of it when you that and be considerate of it when you can. Yep. Thanks. Question in the question in the Thanks. Question in the question in the Thanks. Question in the question in the audience. Oh, I'm sorry. You want to audience. Oh, I'm sorry. You want to audience. Oh, I'm sorry. You want to please if you want to respond? Yeah. Don, please forgive. This uh question is Don, please forgive. This uh question is Don, please forgive. This uh question is going to be directed at Amazon going to be directed at Amazon going to be directed at Amazon predominantly. predominantly. predominantly. Um, so I spoken to James Kettle a couple Um, so I spoken to James Kettle a couple Um, so I spoken to James Kettle a couple years ago and he so Amazon has a long years ago and he so Amazon has a long years ago and he so Amazon has a long history of um an NDA around his bug history of um an NDA around his bug history of um an NDA around his bug program and James Kettle I spoke to him program and James Kettle I spoke to him program and James Kettle I spoke to him he said he had to unsign the NDA with he said he had to unsign the NDA with he said he had to unsign the NDA with Amazon because of some vulnerabilities Amazon because of some vulnerabilities Amazon because of some vulnerabilities he reported because they were going to he reported because they were going to he reported because they were going to discuss some of the things Amazon as and discuss some of the things Amazon as and discuss some of the things Amazon as and I've also spoken to some of the team I've also spoken to some of the team I've also spoken to some of the team here and they've said that the current here and they've said that the current here and they've said that the current way that Amazon operates It's there's a way that Amazon operates It's there's a way that Amazon operates It's there's a lot of um there's two different ways of lot of um there's two different ways of lot of um there's two different ways of reporting vulnerabilities. There's the reporting vulnerabilities. There's the reporting vulnerabilities. There's the VDP and there's the bug bunning program. VDP and there's the bug bunning program. VDP and there's the bug bunning program. And if it goes through the bug bug And if it goes through the bug bug And if it goes through the bug bug bunning program, you have to assign an bunning program, you have to assign an bunning program, you have to assign an NDA and then that vulnerability will not NDA and then that vulnerability will not NDA and then that vulnerability will not become public. And so kind of the way become public. And so kind of the way become public. And so kind of the way that the infrastructure is working that the infrastructure is working that the infrastructure is working currently in the way that the flow is is currently in the way that the flow is is currently in the way that the flow is is there's currently an environment where there's currently an environment where there's currently an environment where Amazon's basically paying for researcher Amazon's basically paying for researcher Amazon's basically paying for researcher silence around vulnerabilities. silence around vulnerabilities. silence around vulnerabilities. And how in that culture is And how in that culture is And how in that culture is this it's it seems like there's this this it's it seems like there's this this it's it seems like there's this goal of being more open and transparent, goal of being more open and transparent, goal of being more open and transparent, but yet there seems to be existing this but yet there seems to be existing this but yet there seems to be existing this existing set of culture around keep existing set of culture around keep existing set of culture around keep researchers silenced around researchers silenced around researchers silenced around vulnerabilities. We're going to pay you vulnerabilities. We're going to pay you vulnerabilities. We're going to pay you for not talking about them. We're going for not talking about them. We're going for not talking about them. We're going to pay you to not disclose these to pay you to not disclose these to pay you to not disclose these vulnerabilities. And yet this is also vulnerabilities. And yet this is also vulnerabilities. And yet this is also part of the goal that you're seeming to part of the goal that you're seeming to part of the goal that you're seeming to be. And so I'm I'm trying to square be. And so I'm I'm trying to square be. And so I'm I'm trying to square these two worlds and they don't seem to these two worlds and they don't seem to these two worlds and they don't seem to line up. an NDA associated with being part of the an NDA associated with being part of the an NDA associated with being part of the private bug bounty program. It's al private bug bounty program. It's al private bug bounty program. It's al there's also a a rack of benefits that there's also a a rack of benefits that there's also a a rack of benefits that come with being part of essentially the come with being part of essentially the come with being part of essentially the private bug bounty program. Everything private bug bounty program. Everything private bug bounty program. Everything from your accounts being paid for for from your accounts being paid for for from your accounts being paid for for your research, uh being educated and your research, uh being educated and your research, uh being educated and trained on how to perform research trained on how to perform research trained on how to perform research against the platform, being given against the platform, being given against the platform, being given insights into essentially how certain insights into essentially how certain insights into essentially how certain things work and the and the sharper things work and the and the sharper things work and the and the sharper corners of the platform that we're corners of the platform that we're corners of the platform that we're asking folks to actually focus at um asking folks to actually focus at um asking folks to actually focus at um including pre-released and and you know including pre-released and and you know including pre-released and and you know as and in some cases newly released as and in some cases newly released as and in some cases newly released services that we're asking folks to services that we're asking folks to services that we're asking folks to focus on. So an NDA associated around focus on. So an NDA associated around focus on. So an NDA associated around effectively those activities and the effectively those activities and the effectively those activities and the vulnerabilities found with them is vulnerabilities found with them is vulnerabilities found with them is absolutely appropriate. your contracted absolutely appropriate. your contracted absolutely appropriate. your contracted work at that point. And so if folks want work at that point. And so if folks want work at that point. And so if folks want to participate in the private bug bounty to participate in the private bug bounty to participate in the private bug bounty program, that's a choice. That's a program, that's a choice. That's a program, that's a choice. That's a choice they can make. Um it's a choice choice they can make. Um it's a choice choice they can make. Um it's a choice that they can they can make in terms of that they can they can make in terms of that they can they can make in terms of like um engaging in that and and reaping like um engaging in that and and reaping like um engaging in that and and reaping the rewards for it, which happen to be the rewards for it, which happen to be the rewards for it, which happen to be significant in many cases just as we wouldn't for a cases just as we wouldn't for a cases just as we wouldn't for a privately found discovered issue that we privately found discovered issue that we privately found discovered issue that we had ourselves and that we fixed and that had ourselves and that we fixed and that had ourselves and that we fixed and that we felt that there was no action or we felt that there was no action or we felt that there was no action or notification for customers for. Now in notification for customers for. Now in notification for customers for. Now in the cases of issues where we find that the cases of issues where we find that the cases of issues where we find that there's a customer impact and the there's a customer impact and the there's a customer impact and the customer needs to be taking action or customer needs to be taking action or customer needs to be taking action or they need to be notified of a change to they need to be notified of a change to they need to be notified of a change to a service that's necessary for us to the a service that's necessary for us to the a service that's necessary for us to the customers are contacted directly. So customers are contacted directly. So customers are contacted directly. So from our purpose for our purposes our from our purpose for our purposes our from our purpose for our purposes our engagement with our customers and engagement with our customers and engagement with our customers and ensuring that they're secure over any ensuring that they're secure over any ensuring that they're secure over any particular issue whether it's found particular issue whether it's found particular issue whether it's found within the company itself from our own within the company itself from our own within the company itself from our own research team whether it's found by a research team whether it's found by a research team whether it's found by a private bug bounty you know researcher private bug bounty you know researcher private bug bounty you know researcher or whether it's just coming in through or whether it's just coming in through or whether it's just coming in through the front door the primary means of the front door the primary means of the front door the primary means of making sure that we protect the customer making sure that we protect the customer making sure that we protect the customer is engaging the customer directly and is engaging the customer directly and is engaging the customer directly and ensuring that they take the appropriate ensuring that they take the appropriate ensuring that they take the appropriate actions if they have to take those that actions if they have to take those that actions if they have to take those that happens in all cases full stop no happens in all cases full stop no happens in all cases full stop no exceptions so protecting the customer is exceptions so protecting the customer is exceptions so protecting the customer is happening. An assignment of a number for happening. An assignment of a number for happening. An assignment of a number for the purposes of public record, the purposes of public record, the purposes of public record, somebody's somebody's resume, um somebody's somebody's resume, um somebody's somebody's resume, um somebody else's curiosity in terms of, somebody else's curiosity in terms of, somebody else's curiosity in terms of, you know, what they want to see we're you know, what they want to see we're you know, what they want to see we're fixing and how we're actually fixing it, fixing and how we're actually fixing it, fixing and how we're actually fixing it, whether they want to learn from us, whether they want to learn from us, whether they want to learn from us, whether we think that that's a whether we think that that's a whether we think that that's a competitive advantage or not. All of competitive advantage or not. All of competitive advantage or not. All of that stuff is separate from essentially that stuff is separate from essentially that stuff is separate from essentially what we're doing to protect customers. what we're doing to protect customers. what we're doing to protect customers. And that's exactly how I square that And that's exactly how I square that And that's exactly how I square that particular situation. particular situation. particular situation. I will add to that. I will add to that. I will add to that. um especially so Google is very um especially so Google is very um especially so Google is very different in that that case in that we different in that that case in that we different in that that case in that we asked for 90 asked for 90 asked for 90 days but we say like it's always up to days but we say like it's always up to days but we say like it's always up to the researcher who reported when and the researcher who reported when and the researcher who reported when and what they disclosed full stop up to up what they disclosed full stop up to up what they disclosed full stop up to up to them I do however feel like um that to them I do however feel like um that to them I do however feel like um that can put customers at risk and that they can put customers at risk and that they can put customers at risk and that they can go early when we are not ready so I can go early when we are not ready so I can go early when we are not ready so I do see like from a customer perspective do see like from a customer perspective do see like from a customer perspective where like the transparency is valuable where like the transparency is valuable where like the transparency is valuable that they could also be put at risk and that they could also be put at risk and that they could also be put at risk and some of these that are disclosed some of these that are disclosed some of these that are disclosed unfortunately are some of like the unfortunately are some of like the unfortunately are some of like the biggest things that like the escalations biggest things that like the escalations biggest things that like the escalations to like the head of Google Cloud that's to like the head of Google Cloud that's to like the head of Google Cloud that's where most of them come from for these where most of them come from for these where most of them come from for these like disclosure events which you know it like disclosure events which you know it like disclosure events which you know it honestly though if they're fixed go for honestly though if they're fixed go for honestly though if they're fixed go for it like we personally love the it like we personally love the it like we personally love the disclosures um we think it's great for disclosures um we think it's great for disclosures um we think it's great for the community at large I mean for anything that meets our I mean for anything that meets our I mean for anything that meets our reward criteria Yes. reward criteria Yes. reward criteria Yes. Yep. Anything anything to add, Lisa? I'm Yep. Anything anything to add, Lisa? I'm Yep. Anything anything to add, Lisa? I'm going to answer a question over here, going to answer a question over here, going to answer a question over here, but no, I I think that that all three of but no, I I think that that all three of but no, I I think that that all three of us kind of feel the same way that us kind of feel the same way that us kind of feel the same way that protecting the customer is the primary protecting the customer is the primary protecting the customer is the primary thing to do in this situation and and thing to do in this situation and and thing to do in this situation and and and everything else is is additional, and everything else is is additional, and everything else is is additional, but we need to protect the customers but we need to protect the customers but we need to protect the customers because in this case, they can't protect because in this case, they can't protect because in this case, they can't protect themselves necessarily. themselves necessarily. themselves necessarily. Yeah, I love your last comment about Yeah, I love your last comment about Yeah, I love your last comment about protecting the customers. So barring protecting the customers. So barring protecting the customers. So barring um barring breaking any functionality um barring breaking any functionality um barring breaking any functionality for the customers, barring you know an for the customers, barring you know an for the customers, barring you know an incident or anything along those lines, incident or anything along those lines, incident or anything along those lines, other than giving recognition for the other than giving recognition for the other than giving recognition for the researchers, how does issuing a CVE for researchers, how does issuing a CVE for researchers, how does issuing a CVE for a SAS program or for a cloud product, a SAS program or for a cloud product, a SAS program or for a cloud product, how does how does how does it benefit the security of the it benefit the security of the it benefit the security of the customers? We were actually talking about this We were actually talking about this We were actually talking about this earlier. So, one of our internal uh call earlier. So, one of our internal uh call earlier. So, one of our internal uh call them CVR teams found a critical them CVR teams found a critical them CVR teams found a critical vulnerability in Google Cloud. So, we vulnerability in Google Cloud. So, we vulnerability in Google Cloud. So, we this is like nine months ago before we this is like nine months ago before we this is like nine months ago before we said we were going to start publishing said we were going to start publishing said we were going to start publishing and we didn't and today we would. and we didn't and today we would. and we didn't and today we would. However, we recognized that one of our However, we recognized that one of our However, we recognized that one of our primary and there like on primary and there like on primary and there like on bugconers.google.com at google.com bugconers.google.com at google.com bugconers.google.com at google.com there's a blog about this that you can there's a blog about this that you can there's a blog about this that you can go read and it says we thought that one go read and it says we thought that one go read and it says we thought that one of our competitors up on the stage uh of our competitors up on the stage uh of our competitors up on the stage uh might also be impacted we checked it and might also be impacted we checked it and might also be impacted we checked it and found out that's found out that's found out that's true they could have read the CVE and true they could have read the CVE and true they could have read the CVE and found hey critical vulnerability in found hey critical vulnerability in found hey critical vulnerability in Google cloud no action required however Google cloud no action required however Google cloud no action required however it sounds like we use that same exact it sounds like we use that same exact it sounds like we use that same exact technology maybe we should go check in technology maybe we should go check in technology maybe we should go check in our environment as well and see if we're our environment as well and see if we're our environment as well and see if we're at risk and that's where I think at risk and that's where I think at risk and that's where I think like like like it's common problems across all cloud it's common problems across all cloud it's common problems across all cloud providers and per perhaps even our providers and per perhaps even our providers and per perhaps even our customers so that can learn and figure customers so that can learn and figure customers so that can learn and figure out whether like they are at risk or not out whether like they are at risk or not out whether like they are at risk or not there was a question over here couple of there was a question over here couple of there was a question over here couple of questions y so I I know there's a lot of push to so I I know there's a lot of push to so I I know there's a lot of push to move to to the SAS environments because move to to the SAS environments because move to to the SAS environments because as Art said you can patch very quickly as Art said you can patch very quickly as Art said you can patch very quickly there's minimal down time completely there's minimal down time completely there's minimal down time completely understandable. Um, we've looked at a understandable. Um, we've looked at a understandable. Um, we've looked at a lot of of uh applications, some that are lot of of uh applications, some that are lot of of uh applications, some that are SASbased, some that are pazbased, some SASbased, some that are pazbased, some SASbased, some that are pazbased, some that are IAS based, depending on what it that are IAS based, depending on what it that are IAS based, depending on what it is. Um, as a general concept, a lot of is. Um, as a general concept, a lot of is. Um, as a general concept, a lot of vendors, not necessarily U3, have been vendors, not necessarily U3, have been vendors, not necessarily U3, have been saying, hey, just move it to to SAS. saying, hey, just move it to to SAS. saying, hey, just move it to to SAS. It's less of a headache, less of a It's less of a headache, less of a It's less of a headache, less of a problem. We'll cover everything. and problem. We'll cover everything. and problem. We'll cover everything. and we'll probably charge you more, but of we'll probably charge you more, but of we'll probably charge you more, but of course that's whatever. The issue with course that's whatever. The issue with course that's whatever. The issue with one particular vendor who not being one particular vendor who not being one particular vendor who not being named and it wasn't one of you three is named and it wasn't one of you three is named and it wasn't one of you three is we had the the Paz platform. We did a we had the the Paz platform. We did a we had the the Paz platform. We did a vulnerability scan on everything they vulnerability scan on everything they vulnerability scan on everything they gave to us. It had some very bothersome gave to us. It had some very bothersome gave to us. It had some very bothersome vulnerabilities. Their solution was well vulnerabilities. Their solution was well vulnerabilities. Their solution was well just move it to a SAS platform. Problems just move it to a SAS platform. Problems just move it to a SAS platform. Problems go away. Suffice to say, I had um a go away. Suffice to say, I had um a go away. Suffice to say, I had um a couple issues with that for reasons. The couple issues with that for reasons. The couple issues with that for reasons. The primary one being as a SAS platform, we primary one being as a SAS platform, we primary one being as a SAS platform, we don't always get that inside view on don't always get that inside view on don't always get that inside view on what's in the SAS platform, what what's in the SAS platform, what what's in the SAS platform, what vulnerabilities exist. We do trust you vulnerabilities exist. We do trust you vulnerabilities exist. We do trust you to do your due diligence, but we don't to do your due diligence, but we don't to do your due diligence, but we don't always have that visibility. So for the always have that visibility. So for the always have that visibility. So for the paranoid people out here who don't trust paranoid people out here who don't trust paranoid people out here who don't trust anybody, which is probably like 80% of anybody, which is probably like 80% of anybody, which is probably like 80% of the people here, how do we get that the people here, how do we get that the people here, how do we get that confidence that any SAS vendor is doing confidence that any SAS vendor is doing confidence that any SAS vendor is doing their due diligence? And yes, we there their due diligence? And yes, we there their due diligence? And yes, we there are lawsuits in in cases there's a there are lawsuits in in cases there's a there are lawsuits in in cases there's a there is a breach, but it's our data. It's our is a breach, but it's our data. It's our is a breach, but it's our data. It's our reputation that's going to be suffering reputation that's going to be suffering reputation that's going to be suffering if there is a compromise, especially if if there is a compromise, especially if if there is a compromise, especially if PII is PII is PII is involved. I hope you weren't expecting involved. I hope you weren't expecting involved. I hope you weren't expecting an easy one. an easy one. an easy one. I'm not sure we're the experts at I'm not sure we're the experts at I'm not sure we're the experts at answering that particular question answering that particular question answering that particular question because we're not out there selling because we're not out there selling because we're not out there selling cloud services. We're trying to protect cloud services. We're trying to protect cloud services. We're trying to protect the customers. So the customers. So the customers. So um um um so I don't know how to answer that so I don't know how to answer that so I don't know how to answer that question. I I have answer as well. My question. I I have answer as well. My question. I I have answer as well. My answer my answer is answer my answer is answer my answer is um it's not just it's not just the trust um it's not just it's not just the trust um it's not just it's not just the trust part, it is the verify part. So, part, it is the verify part. So, part, it is the verify part. So, um, you know, we've got a good number of um, you know, we've got a good number of um, you know, we've got a good number of security bulletins that are published security bulletins that are published security bulletins that are published and not all of those, in fact, the vast and not all of those, in fact, the vast and not all of those, in fact, the vast majority of them are not AWS specific majority of them are not AWS specific majority of them are not AWS specific because we understand that there's a because we understand that there's a because we understand that there's a relationship between the software that relationship between the software that relationship between the software that we're using and providing or reending we're using and providing or reending we're using and providing or reending or, you know, providing as a service or, you know, providing as a service or, you know, providing as a service that we'll have to take action whether that we'll have to take action whether that we'll have to take action whether or not you noticed it or not. and we or not you noticed it or not. and we or not you noticed it or not. and we want to make sure that you have the want to make sure that you have the want to make sure that you have the assurance that we've done that. We've assurance that we've done that. We've assurance that we've done that. We've done our due diligence associated with done our due diligence associated with done our due diligence associated with that, that, that, but we could say a lot of stuff on but we could say a lot of stuff on but we could say a lot of stuff on security security security bulletins. How do you actually like bulletins. How do you actually like bulletins. How do you actually like beyond just trusting that, how do you beyond just trusting that, how do you beyond just trusting that, how do you actually verify it? And so in the actually verify it? And so in the actually verify it? And so in the context of like what you have access to context of like what you have access to context of like what you have access to as a customer, whether it is versioning as a customer, whether it is versioning as a customer, whether it is versioning and the ability to actually check those and the ability to actually check those and the ability to actually check those things yourself and our and and us things yourself and our and and us things yourself and our and and us giving you the wherewithal, the tools to giving you the wherewithal, the tools to giving you the wherewithal, the tools to do it or ensuring that we're do it or ensuring that we're do it or ensuring that we're participating in a number of different participating in a number of different participating in a number of different again compliance regimes in that case again compliance regimes in that case again compliance regimes in that case where auditors are taking the actions where auditors are taking the actions where auditors are taking the actions and they're third party auditors like I and they're third party auditors like I and they're third party auditors like I don't I don't have control over them don't I don't have control over them don't I don't have control over them once they walk into the building once they walk into the building once they walk into the building effectively to tell them no I'm sorry effectively to tell them no I'm sorry effectively to tell them no I'm sorry you can't go and test for that. You you can't go and test for that. You you can't go and test for that. You can't go and check for that. Like their can't go and check for that. Like their can't go and check for that. Like their remit and the ability for them to go and remit and the ability for them to go and remit and the ability for them to go and report to whoever organization is giving report to whoever organization is giving report to whoever organization is giving us the certification is that they'll do us the certification is that they'll do us the certification is that they'll do that in an independent fashion. And that in an independent fashion. And that in an independent fashion. And those are probably the two biggest those are probably the two biggest those are probably the two biggest functions is not just seeing the record functions is not just seeing the record functions is not just seeing the record of somebody that's communicating with of somebody that's communicating with of somebody that's communicating with you and wants to ensure that you have you and wants to ensure that you have you and wants to ensure that you have the information and that's one thing but the information and that's one thing but the information and that's one thing but having the wherewithal or ability to having the wherewithal or ability to having the wherewithal or ability to check for yourself or know that there is check for yourself or know that there is check for yourself or know that there is going to be somebody who's checking and going to be somebody who's checking and going to be somebody who's checking and validating that. validating that. validating that. And I was going to say the audit and And I was going to say the audit and And I was going to say the audit and compliance um as well, but the I also compliance um as well, but the I also compliance um as well, but the I also say like scans are notoriously like say like scans are notoriously like say like scans are notoriously like unreliable just generally unreliable just generally unreliable just generally speaking. There's like there's so many speaking. There's like there's so many speaking. There's like there's so many mitigations especially I will say at mitigations especially I will say at mitigations especially I will say at like large cloud providers that just like large cloud providers that just like large cloud providers that just because a specific dependency uh shows because a specific dependency uh shows because a specific dependency uh shows up in a scan does not mean that it's up in a scan does not mean that it's up in a scan does not mean that it's reachable. Whoever, if you think it is, reachable. Whoever, if you think it is, reachable. Whoever, if you think it is, all the three of us have bug bounty all the three of us have bug bounty all the three of us have bug bounty programs and would love to pay you money programs and would love to pay you money programs and would love to pay you money if you can prove that it is actually if you can prove that it is actually if you can prove that it is actually externally exploitable in the wild. So externally exploitable in the wild. So externally exploitable in the wild. So like you can also somewhat rely on that. So every website is essentially a that. So every website is essentially a that. So every website is essentially a web service. So are we expecting web service. So are we expecting web service. So are we expecting everyone who runs their own website to everyone who runs their own website to everyone who runs their own website to become a CNA? That's that's where the slippery slope That's that's where the slippery slope That's that's where the slippery slope comes in, Jonathan. Right. So, you do comes in, Jonathan. Right. So, you do comes in, Jonathan. Right. So, you do have to you do have to make choices have to you do have to make choices have to you do have to make choices about what you're going to assign for about what you're going to assign for about what you're going to assign for and what you're not going to assign for. and what you're not going to assign for. and what you're not going to assign for. And and it it's not that cut and dry, And and it it's not that cut and dry, And and it it's not that cut and dry, but you know, we've made some of that but you know, we've made some of that but you know, we've made some of that those decisions ourselves. and some those decisions ourselves. and some those decisions ourselves. and some certain things, you know, we've got certain things, you know, we've got certain things, you know, we've got databases on databases on databases and databases on databases on databases and databases on databases on databases and and we've got some things we're not and we've got some things we're not and we've got some things we're not going to assign for those, right? So, we going to assign for those, right? So, we going to assign for those, right? So, we don't have to think about that. And that don't have to think about that. And that don't have to think about that. And that might be a situation where it's a simple might be a situation where it's a simple might be a situation where it's a simple web page. We don't we we don't think web page. We don't we we don't think web page. We don't we we don't think it's valuable for anybody to take any it's valuable for anybody to take any it's valuable for anybody to take any time to read a CVE like that. it. I'll time to read a CVE like that. it. I'll time to read a CVE like that. it. I'll I'll also say that um I spoke earlier I'll also say that um I spoke earlier I'll also say that um I spoke earlier about where we draw a line in terms of about where we draw a line in terms of about where we draw a line in terms of customer agency and we feel it's customer agency and we feel it's customer agency and we feel it's important to make sure that we're we're important to make sure that we're we're important to make sure that we're we're reflecting on that and giving customers reflecting on that and giving customers reflecting on that and giving customers the opportunity to assess risk for the opportunity to assess risk for the opportunity to assess risk for themselves if we're not directly themselves if we're not directly themselves if we're not directly communicating with them. The same thing communicating with them. The same thing communicating with them. The same thing applies for somebody that's wanting to applies for somebody that's wanting to applies for somebody that's wanting to be a CNA operator is whether or not you be a CNA operator is whether or not you be a CNA operator is whether or not you want to have that agency yourself. So want to have that agency yourself. So want to have that agency yourself. So Art was asking before you know sort of Art was asking before you know sort of Art was asking before you know sort of describe your journey to becoming a CNA describe your journey to becoming a CNA describe your journey to becoming a CNA and largely before the rule change last and largely before the rule change last and largely before the rule change last year there was no necessity in terms of year there was no necessity in terms of year there was no necessity in terms of agency for Amazon to own a CNA. The agency for Amazon to own a CNA. The agency for Amazon to own a CNA. The published CVEes associated with any published CVEes associated with any published CVEes associated with any number of AWS specific um services was number of AWS specific um services was number of AWS specific um services was largely minimal and if it had to be largely minimal and if it had to be largely minimal and if it had to be assigned somebody else could assign it. assigned somebody else could assign it. assigned somebody else could assign it. anything that was being issued at GHSA anything that was being issued at GHSA anything that was being issued at GHSA for our GitHub owned actual code was for our GitHub owned actual code was for our GitHub owned actual code was also getting a CVE assigned by GitHub as also getting a CVE assigned by GitHub as also getting a CVE assigned by GitHub as a CNA. So, um, folks were doing the work a CNA. So, um, folks were doing the work a CNA. So, um, folks were doing the work for us effectively as a CNA. Um, but for us effectively as a CNA. Um, but for us effectively as a CNA. Um, but with the rule change and the ability for with the rule change and the ability for with the rule change and the ability for anybody else to issue CBEEs against us, anybody else to issue CBEEs against us, anybody else to issue CBEEs against us, right? We felt that owning the right? We felt that owning the right? We felt that owning the conversation with our customers meant conversation with our customers meant conversation with our customers meant more and taking the agency ourselves more and taking the agency ourselves more and taking the agency ourselves than allowing other folks to basically than allowing other folks to basically than allowing other folks to basically define what was a CBE for AWS. And that define what was a CBE for AWS. And that define what was a CBE for AWS. And that just means it's going to be more just means it's going to be more just means it's going to be more consistent coming from us as consistent coming from us as consistent coming from us as understanders of the platform and owners understanders of the platform and owners understanders of the platform and owners of of of it. It's a choice. Respon Oh, sorry. Response, I choice. Respon Oh, sorry. Response, I choice. Respon Oh, sorry. Response, I believe. Hang on a second. Yeah. So to believe. Hang on a second. Yeah. So to believe. Hang on a second. Yeah. So to kind of extend on that, um, essentially kind of extend on that, um, essentially kind of extend on that, um, essentially there's nothing stopping researchers there's nothing stopping researchers there's nothing stopping researchers from going to MITER to get a CV ID in from going to MITER to get a CV ID in from going to MITER to get a CV ID in somebody's website, right? And and MITER somebody's website, right? And and MITER somebody's website, right? And and MITER has assigned some no action CVE that I has assigned some no action CVE that I has assigned some no action CVE that I that I've seen. So I was a little that I've seen. So I was a little that I've seen. So I was a little worried that a lot of people were going worried that a lot of people were going worried that a lot of people were going to go to MITER and they were going to be to go to MITER and they were going to be to go to MITER and they were going to be overwhelmed, but that hasn't happened. overwhelmed, but that hasn't happened. overwhelmed, but that hasn't happened. My guess is that we've trained the My guess is that we've trained the My guess is that we've trained the researchers not to do that, but they researchers not to do that, but they researchers not to do that, but they haven't figured out that they can yet. haven't figured out that they can yet. haven't figured out that they can yet. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. We're gonna We're gonna We're gonna Can we uh can we quickly move the slider Can we uh can we quickly move the slider Can we uh can we quickly move the slider to TLP red and everybody forget turn off to TLP red and everybody forget turn off to TLP red and everybody forget turn off zoom. Nobody pay attention to this this zoom. Nobody pay attention to this this zoom. Nobody pay attention to this this opportunity. Sorry. Uh question over opportunity. Sorry. Uh question over opportunity. Sorry. Uh question over there. Yeah. Yeah. Um so my question is there. Yeah. Yeah. Um so my question is there. Yeah. Yeah. Um so my question is uh basically why there is now kind of uh basically why there is now kind of uh basically why there is now kind of this big discussion about SAS. And the this big discussion about SAS. And the this big discussion about SAS. And the reason is because when I think about uh reason is because when I think about uh reason is because when I think about uh this um it reminds me a little bit about this um it reminds me a little bit about this um it reminds me a little bit about the discussions between static and the discussions between static and the discussions between static and dynamic library loading that we had kind dynamic library loading that we had kind dynamic library loading that we had kind of a couple of years ago where um of a couple of years ago where um of a couple of years ago where um basically you can provide something on basically you can provide something on basically you can provide something on prem or basically provided with the prem or basically provided with the prem or basically provided with the operating system and the operating operating system and the operating operating system and the operating system takes care of updating it and um system takes care of updating it and um system takes care of updating it and um basically we have APIs between those basically we have APIs between those basically we have APIs between those services being decom RPC and now kind of services being decom RPC and now kind of services being decom RPC and now kind of HTTP requests and we also in this HTTP requests and we also in this HTTP requests and we also in this community talk a lot about now uh very community talk a lot about now uh very community talk a lot about now uh very much about kind of what is the effect on much about kind of what is the effect on much about kind of what is the effect on the upstream component versus how is the the upstream component versus how is the the upstream component versus how is the effect of on the supply chain we talk effect of on the supply chain we talk effect of on the supply chain we talk about sbomb we talk about vax and in the about sbomb we talk about vax and in the about sbomb we talk about vax and in the end kind of my question is really in end kind of my question is really in end kind of my question is really in that entire discussion do I need to that entire discussion do I need to that entire discussion do I need to think that there's a difference about a think that there's a difference about a think that there's a difference about a vulnerability in the pal basically vulnerability in the pal basically vulnerability in the pal basically affecting all my authentication or a affecting all my authentication or a affecting all my authentication or a vulnerability in octa android ID vulnerability in octa android ID vulnerability in octa android ID affecting all my um services so um I affecting all my um services so um I affecting all my um services so um I would want to get your um kind of would want to get your um kind of would want to get your um kind of thoughts on that because from my thoughts on that because from my thoughts on that because from my perspective And this kind of was the perspective And this kind of was the perspective And this kind of was the beginning of the question. All those beginning of the question. All those beginning of the question. All those SAS services or all those SAS tools SAS services or all those SAS tools SAS services or all those SAS tools should be kind of handled the same as we should be kind of handled the same as we should be kind of handled the same as we do the entire IT component industry. Uh do the entire IT component industry. Uh do the entire IT component industry. Uh in the past before we were issuing CBEEs that past before we were issuing CBEEs that past before we were issuing CBEEs that were specific to AWS, we still issued were specific to AWS, we still issued were specific to AWS, we still issued security security security bulletins. So for me largely the rule bulletins. So for me largely the rule bulletins. So for me largely the rule change isn't change isn't change isn't you know, isn't a change as much as it you know, isn't a change as much as it you know, isn't a change as much as it is um an extra set of logistics that may be different for, you logistics that may be different for, you logistics that may be different for, you know, for for different folks in know, for for different folks in know, for for different folks in different levels, right? So, like for different levels, right? So, like for different levels, right? So, like for for us, we have infrastructure and for us, we have infrastructure and for us, we have infrastructure and platform and software as a service. And platform and software as a service. And platform and software as a service. And then we also have software components then we also have software components then we also have software components that are sitting outside of essentially that are sitting outside of essentially that are sitting outside of essentially what we you know what we own and operate what we you know what we own and operate what we you know what we own and operate that reside within a customer's that reside within a customer's that reside within a customer's environment. And then you've got things environment. And then you've got things environment. And then you've got things like like like um outposts which are basically a piece um outposts which are basically a piece um outposts which are basically a piece of the cloud that's running within a of the cloud that's running within a of the cloud that's running within a customer's data customer's data customer's data center and it goes on and on and on and center and it goes on and on and on and center and it goes on and on and on and at this point the CNA that we operate at this point the CNA that we operate at this point the CNA that we operate actually covers Amazon as a whole. So actually covers Amazon as a whole. So actually covers Amazon as a whole. So that includes that includes that includes devices. So we get we get the smoresport devices. So we get we get the smoresport devices. So we get we get the smoresport of all the different layers that we of all the different layers that we of all the different layers that we possibly consider. somebody that's just possibly consider. somebody that's just possibly consider. somebody that's just operating SAS and thinking about whether operating SAS and thinking about whether operating SAS and thinking about whether or not or just using SAS and thinking or not or just using SAS and thinking or not or just using SAS and thinking about whether or not I need to pay about whether or not I need to pay about whether or not I need to pay attention to its vulnerabilities attention to its vulnerabilities attention to its vulnerabilities um and its dependency or my dependencies um and its dependency or my dependencies um and its dependency or my dependencies on them and the grand scheme of some on them and the grand scheme of some on them and the grand scheme of some other architecture or environment that other architecture or environment that other architecture or environment that you've crafted which as you know you you you've crafted which as you know you you you've crafted which as you know you you can make it pretty complex particularly can make it pretty complex particularly can make it pretty complex particularly when you start talking about um uh when you start talking about um uh when you start talking about um uh identity providers that sit outside of identity providers that sit outside of identity providers that sit outside of essentially the application environment essentially the application environment essentially the application environment and now you've got like a really good and now you've got like a really good and now you've got like a really good mess in terms of like interdependencies mess in terms of like interdependencies mess in terms of like interdependencies So paying attention to all of that is a So paying attention to all of that is a So paying attention to all of that is a tax for somebody that is owning and tax for somebody that is owning and tax for somebody that is owning and operating the environment. Um whether operating the environment. Um whether operating the environment. Um whether it's the you know the the single it's the you know the the single it's the you know the the single developer or whether it's the large team developer or whether it's the large team developer or whether it's the large team that happens to have like a security that happens to have like a security that happens to have like a security team that's dedicated to it and team that's dedicated to it and team that's dedicated to it and understanding the efficiencies that understanding the efficiencies that understanding the efficiencies that you're going to gain from whichever you're going to gain from whichever you're going to gain from whichever providers you choose and how they keep providers you choose and how they keep providers you choose and how they keep you up to date or do updates for you or you up to date or do updates for you or you up to date or do updates for you or both. both. both. right is something that you have to map right is something that you have to map right is something that you have to map out in the design of your actual out in the design of your actual out in the design of your actual application. Like you have to think application. Like you have to think application. Like you have to think about that as overhead just as just as about that as overhead just as just as about that as overhead just as just as much as you think about transactions per much as you think about transactions per much as you think about transactions per second, how many databases or second, how many databases or second, how many databases or replications you have, however many replications you have, however many replications you have, however many different regions you're running in, you different regions you're running in, you different regions you're running in, you have to also think about the contracts have to also think about the contracts have to also think about the contracts that you have in terms of understand not that you have in terms of understand not that you have in terms of understand not not saying like the written contracts not saying like the written contracts not saying like the written contracts but you know the software contracts as but you know the software contracts as but you know the software contracts as well as the updating contracts and well as the updating contracts and well as the updating contracts and expectations that you have around that expectations that you have around that expectations that you have around that environment. And I would say that it's environment. And I would say that it's environment. And I would say that it's it's generally no different than what it's generally no different than what it's generally no different than what you're describing from history. Just you're describing from history. Just you're describing from history. Just happens to have numbers added to it now happens to have numbers added to it now happens to have numbers added to it now and a little more text. And when I go and a little more text. And when I go and a little more text. And when I go back and say art was asking earlier, um, back and say art was asking earlier, um, back and say art was asking earlier, um, you know, what's what's largely been you know, what's what's largely been you know, what's what's largely been like your impression of essentially like like your impression of essentially like like your impression of essentially like the rule change, I'm like generally the rule change, I'm like generally the rule change, I'm like generally unnecessary from my perspective. Like it unnecessary from my perspective. Like it unnecessary from my perspective. Like it didn't change essentially the didn't change essentially the didn't change essentially the conversation I was having with conversation I was having with conversation I was having with customers, right? It didn't change our customers, right? It didn't change our customers, right? It didn't change our actions in terms of response or how we actions in terms of response or how we actions in terms of response or how we protect customers. What it changed was protect customers. What it changed was protect customers. What it changed was adding numbers and adding text and adding numbers and adding text and adding numbers and adding text and creating more resources for other folks creating more resources for other folks creating more resources for other folks that might want to go and like reference that might want to go and like reference that might want to go and like reference that. And if that's a benefit to them, that. And if that's a benefit to them, that. And if that's a benefit to them, so be it. The data is still being so be it. The data is still being so be it. The data is still being gathered and we're still evaluating gathered and we're still evaluating gathered and we're still evaluating essentially customer feedback and essentially customer feedback and essentially customer feedback and behaviors to understand is it a value to behaviors to understand is it a value to behaviors to understand is it a value to them because at the end of the day, I do them because at the end of the day, I do them because at the end of the day, I do not serve effectively MITER. I don't not serve effectively MITER. I don't not serve effectively MITER. I don't serve any number of other different serve any number of other different serve any number of other different industries other than my customers. And industries other than my customers. And industries other than my customers. And that's the expectation that I'm trying that's the expectation that I'm trying that's the expectation that I'm trying to live up to. Google agrees with AWS. Google agrees with AWS. Google agrees with AWS. Oh, I was gonna say that's not exciting. Oh, I was gonna say that's not exciting. Oh, I was gonna say that's not exciting. Come on, Lisa. Disagree with AWS, Come on, Lisa. Disagree with AWS, Come on, Lisa. Disagree with AWS, please. I'm I'm about to, but I'll I'll please. I'm I'm about to, but I'll I'll please. I'm I'm about to, but I'll I'll wait a minute. wait a minute. wait a minute. Okay. And it's not it's not really a Okay. And it's not it's not really a Okay. And it's not it's not really a disagreement, but um so Beetle, you you disagreement, but um so Beetle, you you disagreement, but um so Beetle, you you described there um very nicely sort of a described there um very nicely sort of a described there um very nicely sort of a lot of things. Uh I forget all the lot of things. Uh I forget all the lot of things. Uh I forget all the terms. IAS, PAS, SAAS, actual devices, a terms. IAS, PAS, SAAS, actual devices, a terms. IAS, PAS, SAAS, actual devices, a Linux distro, external I uh external um Linux distro, external I uh external um Linux distro, external I uh external um off providers, outpost, mic, the cloud off providers, outpost, mic, the cloud off providers, outpost, mic, the cloud in my cloud or whatever, cloud on prim a in my cloud or whatever, cloud on prim a in my cloud or whatever, cloud on prim a lot of stuff. And I uh I'm a customer of lot of stuff. And I uh I'm a customer of lot of stuff. And I uh I'm a customer of at least two of the three of your at least two of the three of your at least two of the three of your offerings. I don't know who it is, but offerings. I don't know who it is, but offerings. I don't know who it is, but um twothirds of you, and I very much um twothirds of you, and I very much um twothirds of you, and I very much appreciate the the uh um the support and appreciate the the uh um the support and appreciate the the uh um the support and the security advice that we get. So, all the security advice that we get. So, all the security advice that we get. So, all great there. Um, but this is such a great there. Um, but this is such a great there. Um, but this is such a mess, man. Wait, which Amazon AWS thing mess, man. Wait, which Amazon AWS thing mess, man. Wait, which Amazon AWS thing was it? Was it that one or the other was it? Was it that one or the other was it? Was it that one or the other one? Maybe you have a number on your one? Maybe you have a number on your one? Maybe you have a number on your internal customer things, but wh which internal customer things, but wh which internal customer things, but wh which one is it? Gee, wouldn't it be great if one is it? Gee, wouldn't it be great if one is it? Gee, wouldn't it be great if there were, and I'm biased, a globally there were, and I'm biased, a globally there were, and I'm biased, a globally mostly unique, mostly global number, so mostly unique, mostly global number, so mostly unique, mostly global number, so I can say, "Oh, it was that thing. Hey, I can say, "Oh, it was that thing. Hey, I can say, "Oh, it was that thing. Hey, they fixed it. I definitely got the they fixed it. I definitely got the they fixed it. I definitely got the notice in advance. We're totally fine. notice in advance. We're totally fine. notice in advance. We're totally fine. It's not the other thing with the other It's not the other thing with the other It's not the other thing with the other number." And that to me truly is the number." And that to me truly is the number." And that to me truly is the potential benefit of having this global potential benefit of having this global potential benefit of having this global numbers. So that's my plea for the numbers. So that's my plea for the numbers. So that's my plea for the numbers. I don't know that that's numbers. I don't know that that's numbers. I don't know that that's actually helpful, but that would be my actually helpful, but that would be my actually helpful, but that would be my uh my take on it. Argue against essentially the it. Argue against essentially the it. Argue against essentially the existence of the numbers. Remember, I existence of the numbers. Remember, I existence of the numbers. Remember, I got to help launch CVE, so it's got a got to help launch CVE, so it's got a got to help launch CVE, so it's got a special place in my heart. Um, and I special place in my heart. Um, and I special place in my heart. Um, and I remember why we launched it in the first remember why we launched it in the first remember why we launched it in the first place. We were doing intrusion detection place. We were doing intrusion detection place. We were doing intrusion detection system flyoffs at the time and you could system flyoffs at the time and you could system flyoffs at the time and you could look at, you know, seven different look at, you know, seven different look at, you know, seven different intrusion detection vendors and each one intrusion detection vendors and each one intrusion detection vendors and each one said that they detected something that said that they detected something that said that they detected something that was different than the others or more was different than the others or more was different than the others or more than the others. And we had to come up than the others. And we had to come up than the others. And we had to come up with some type of canonicalization and with some type of canonicalization and with some type of canonicalization and normalization of essentially those normalization of essentially those normalization of essentially those findings and actually give customers a findings and actually give customers a findings and actually give customers a way to understand was this particular way to understand was this particular way to understand was this particular product actually detecting something product actually detecting something product actually detecting something different than that particular project different than that particular project different than that particular project and thus CVE numbering was born. So, I'm and thus CVE numbering was born. So, I'm and thus CVE numbering was born. So, I'm sorry to rehash a little bit of that, sorry to rehash a little bit of that, sorry to rehash a little bit of that, but I know that's Yeah, I was in a lab but I know that's Yeah, I was in a lab but I know that's Yeah, I was in a lab and flying to other places to try and and flying to other places to try and and flying to other places to try and break it at the time. Yeah, we've come break it at the time. Yeah, we've come break it at the time. Yeah, we've come to a same place again where folks are to a same place again where folks are to a same place again where folks are trying to understand in certain trying to understand in certain trying to understand in certain environments, are these are these things environments, are these are these things environments, are these are these things applicable to me, right? And um I'm not applicable to me, right? And um I'm not applicable to me, right? And um I'm not sure that like the numbers themselves sure that like the numbers themselves sure that like the numbers themselves help help define that. Like for for me help help define that. Like for for me help help define that. Like for for me and the way that I communicate with and the way that I communicate with and the way that I communicate with customers ends up being direct messaging customers ends up being direct messaging customers ends up being direct messaging to them and their security team if to them and their security team if to them and their security team if there's an issue in their environment there's an issue in their environment there's an issue in their environment they need to fix. And these wonderful they need to fix. And these wonderful they need to fix. And these wonderful little popups that show up when you log little popups that show up when you log little popups that show up when you log into your actual environment, your into your actual environment, your into your actual environment, your personal health dashboard that also personal health dashboard that also personal health dashboard that also tells you these are the things you need tells you these are the things you need tells you these are the things you need to actually fix. to actually fix. to actually fix. And I can tell you from the data that And I can tell you from the data that And I can tell you from the data that there is way more engagement, direct there is way more engagement, direct there is way more engagement, direct engagement with customers over those engagement with customers over those engagement with customers over those issues and them actually addressing them issues and them actually addressing them issues and them actually addressing them from those messages than there is from from those messages than there is from from those messages than there is from them visiting the security bulletins them visiting the security bulletins them visiting the security bulletins page. The data the data shows that page. The data the data shows that page. The data the data shows that that's how they're finding the that's how they're finding the that's how they're finding the information. That's how they're getting information. That's how they're getting information. That's how they're getting it. That's how it's efficient. They're it. That's how it's efficient. They're it. That's how it's efficient. They're actually getting it through APIs and actually getting it through APIs and actually getting it through APIs and they're applying it directly to their they're applying it directly to their they're applying it directly to their environment and taking automated action. environment and taking automated action. environment and taking automated action. And the idea that there's a database And the idea that there's a database And the idea that there's a database with numbers and text that they're going with numbers and text that they're going with numbers and text that they're going to go and reference and then try and to go and reference and then try and to go and reference and then try and parse it and understand what do I need parse it and understand what do I need parse it and understand what do I need to do with this it doesn't it doesn't to do with this it doesn't it doesn't to do with this it doesn't it doesn't follow that doesn't follow in terms of follow that doesn't follow in terms of follow that doesn't follow in terms of the environment itself doesn't mean that the environment itself doesn't mean that the environment itself doesn't mean that there shouldn't be a record if somebody there shouldn't be a record if somebody there shouldn't be a record if somebody wants to go and look at that record but wants to go and look at that record but wants to go and look at that record but from the from the point of usefulness from the from the point of usefulness from the from the point of usefulness and efficiency and helping the customers and efficiency and helping the customers and efficiency and helping the customers the way that we're directly messaging the way that we're directly messaging the way that we're directly messaging them making things API accessible and them making things API accessible and them making things API accessible and making it feed into triggerable actions making it feed into triggerable actions making it feed into triggerable actions that they can take to apply in their that they can take to apply in their that they can take to apply in their environment means way more than environment means way more than environment means way more than basically updating a database. basically updating a database. basically updating a database. Thanks. Thanks. Thanks. Yeah, please. Absolutely. Y my follow-up Yeah, please. Absolutely. Y my follow-up Yeah, please. Absolutely. Y my follow-up question to that would be kind of I question to that would be kind of I question to that would be kind of I share the opinion that you basically share the opinion that you basically share the opinion that you basically need to have a direct communication with need to have a direct communication with need to have a direct communication with your customer. Basically tell them how your customer. Basically tell them how your customer. Basically tell them how the vulnerability affects them directly. the vulnerability affects them directly. the vulnerability affects them directly. But again then the question like how do But again then the question like how do But again then the question like how do you support your customers to in turn you support your customers to in turn you support your customers to in turn forward that information to their forward that information to their forward that information to their specific customers because on AWS I specific customers because on AWS I specific customers because on AWS I guess other companies host their guess other companies host their guess other companies host their services that in turn serve whatever services that in turn serve whatever services that in turn serve whatever bigger purpose. We got to give the our customers the We got to give the our customers the We got to give the our customers the tools to like know but they have to own tools to like know but they have to own tools to like know but they have to own the relationship with their customers the relationship with their customers the relationship with their customers like like we if we have CBES and a lot like like we if we have CBES and a lot like like we if we have CBES and a lot of times depending on how the their of times depending on how the their of times depending on how the their products are built and they're servicing products are built and they're servicing products are built and they're servicing their customers their customers might their customers their customers might their customers their customers might not know that they're on right GKE or not know that they're on right GKE or not know that they're on right GKE or whatever whatever it underlying system whatever whatever it underlying system whatever whatever it underlying system actually is so like it should be for any actually is so like it should be for any actually is so like it should be for any like hope hopefully reputable like hope hopefully reputable like hope hopefully reputable company it is their company it is their company it is their responsibility to do so like we won't responsibility to do so like we won't responsibility to do so like we won't know who's going to be the end user of know who's going to be the end user of know who's going to be the end user of XYZ so at least that's my my opinion on XYZ so at least that's my my opinion on XYZ so at least that's my my opinion on that um is someone on anything happening on um is someone on anything happening on um is someone on anything happening on Discord I want to not uh not ditch those Discord I want to not uh not ditch those Discord I want to not uh not ditch those folks yeah there's a lot of great folks yeah there's a lot of great folks yeah there's a lot of great discussion. discussion. discussion. Okay. Okay. Sure. Nothing obvious. No Okay. Okay. Sure. Nothing obvious. No Okay. Okay. Sure. Nothing obvious. No op. No. Very well. Okay. Just checking op. No. Very well. Okay. Just checking op. No. Very well. Okay. Just checking with the online folks. Okay. with the online folks. Okay. with the online folks. Okay. Um, sure. Is there Sorry, you're good. The follow-up question would then be as The follow-up question would then be as The follow-up question would then be as a CNA for a smallish company, how can I a CNA for a smallish company, how can I a CNA for a smallish company, how can I get that vulnerability feed from you to get that vulnerability feed from you to get that vulnerability feed from you to that we are able to inform our that we are able to inform our that we are able to inform our customers? I I thought I think I heard them both I I thought I think I heard them both I I thought I think I heard them both say they give you that stuff already. say they give you that stuff already. say they give you that stuff already. Popups, other things. Yeah, I I would Popups, other things. Yeah, I I would Popups, other things. Yeah, I I would say pay attention to your personal say pay attention to your personal say pay attention to your personal personal health dashboard. Uh pay personal health dashboard. Uh pay personal health dashboard. Uh pay attention to essentially the emails that attention to essentially the emails that attention to essentially the emails that actually come to you specifically from a actually come to you specifically from a actually come to you specifically from a security announcement security announcement security announcement perspective. Um if you want to fall back perspective. Um if you want to fall back perspective. Um if you want to fall back and default to essentially an RSS feed and default to essentially an RSS feed and default to essentially an RSS feed announcement and and and popup of like announcement and and and popup of like announcement and and and popup of like the security bulletins page, you can. the security bulletins page, you can. the security bulletins page, you can. But arguably like the most timely, most But arguably like the most timely, most But arguably like the most timely, most important and most direct actionable important and most direct actionable important and most direct actionable information that you will have as a information that you will have as a information that you will have as a customer will come directly from us and customer will come directly from us and customer will come directly from us and through the mechanisms that we provide. through the mechanisms that we provide. through the mechanisms that we provide. But I just want to add But I just want to add But I just want to add that I I don't think a a lot of the that I I don't think a a lot of the that I I don't think a a lot of the billions of Microsoft and and all our billions of Microsoft and and all our billions of Microsoft and and all our customers are reading CBE records. They customers are reading CBE records. They customers are reading CBE records. They aren't right. But if the data is not aren't right. But if the data is not aren't right. But if the data is not there for other consumers of CVE to help there for other consumers of CVE to help there for other consumers of CVE to help the ecosystem, then they can't help the the ecosystem, then they can't help the the ecosystem, then they can't help the ecosystem. I mean, there's there's lots ecosystem. I mean, there's there's lots ecosystem. I mean, there's there's lots and lots of tools as we could see in and lots of tools as we could see in and lots of tools as we could see in the, you know, in the lunchroom of the, you know, in the lunchroom of the, you know, in the lunchroom of people consuming this data and helping people consuming this data and helping people consuming this data and helping people protect themselves and their people protect themselves and their people protect themselves and their environments. If if if we as CNAs don't environments. If if if we as CNAs don't environments. If if if we as CNAs don't give that data for the the industry to give that data for the the industry to give that data for the the industry to use, that's just not there. So I don't use, that's just not there. So I don't use, that's just not there. So I don't think it's I don't think the full think it's I don't think the full think it's I don't think the full responsibility of consuming and responsibility of consuming and responsibility of consuming and absorbing and taking actions on C CN absorbing and taking actions on C CN absorbing and taking actions on C CN CBEEs is is needs to be borne by the the CBEEs is is needs to be borne by the the CBEEs is is needs to be borne by the the CNA. But if the CNA doesn't document it CNA. But if the CNA doesn't document it CNA. But if the CNA doesn't document it and doesn't provide that information, and doesn't provide that information, and doesn't provide that information, nobody can do anything. nobody can do anything. nobody can do anything. Art, I can share something from Discord. Art, I can share something from Discord. Art, I can share something from Discord. We have uh nine minutes. Oh yeah, sure. We have uh nine minutes. Oh yeah, sure. We have uh nine minutes. Oh yeah, sure. Yep. Uh thinking back to the beginning Yep. Uh thinking back to the beginning Yep. Uh thinking back to the beginning of the conversation when you were of the conversation when you were of the conversation when you were discussing um CVE or not to CVE when no discussing um CVE or not to CVE when no discussing um CVE or not to CVE when no a no customer action required. The a no customer action required. The a no customer action required. The question was, what about accounting for question was, what about accounting for question was, what about accounting for potential exploits that may have already potential exploits that may have already potential exploits that may have already taken place and may have compromised a taken place and may have compromised a taken place and may have compromised a SAS customer, right? And I think that SAS customer, right? And I think that SAS customer, right? And I think that was similar to what you were asking was similar to what you were asking was similar to what you were asking earlier, instant response, right? No. earlier, instant response, right? No. earlier, instant response, right? No. So, you know, something happened. The So, you know, something happened. The So, you know, something happened. The time is about right. Something weird's time is about right. Something weird's time is about right. Something weird's in my logs. Oh, I didn't have to take in my logs. Oh, I didn't have to take in my logs. Oh, I didn't have to take action, but somebody fixed something action, but somebody fixed something action, but somebody fixed something around that time. Can I correlate those around that time. Can I correlate those around that time. Can I correlate those things? Is it accurate? Is that things? Is it accurate? Is that things? Is it accurate?

And it's these credentials, right? And it's these credentials, right? And it's these issues that I think um you know issues that I think um you know issues that I think um you know generally will have CWES associated with generally will have CWES associated with generally will have CWES associated with them in many cases which become them in many cases which become them in many cases which become extremely valuable for helping somebody extremely valuable for helping somebody extremely valuable for helping somebody understand where does this fall within understand where does this fall within understand where does this fall within the spectrum of concerns and how should the spectrum of concerns and how should the spectrum of concerns and how should I address those and what are the best I address those and what are the best I address those and what are the best practices for avoiding those. But practices for avoiding those. But practices for avoiding those. But largely the partners that we have and largely the partners that we have and largely the partners that we have and the software that they're using are not the software that they're using are not the software that they're using are not necessarily leveraging CVE as a necessarily leveraging CVE as a necessarily leveraging CVE as a mechanism to give them you know greater mechanism to give them you know greater mechanism to give them you know greater confidence in the platform itself. confidence in the platform itself. confidence in the platform itself.
