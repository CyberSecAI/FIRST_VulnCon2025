Um my name is Jerry workshop with me. Um my name is Jerry workshop with me. Um my name is Jerry Gamblin. See, so about me, I'm a Gamblin. See, so about me, I'm a Gamblin. See, so about me, I'm a principal engineer at Cisco, uh the principal engineer at Cisco, uh the principal engineer at Cisco, uh the threat detection response group. If you threat detection response group. If you threat detection response group. If you have any questions, please email me at have any questions, please email me at have any questions, please email me at gamblin@sisco.com. Not that G in there. gamblin@sisco.com. Not that G in there. gamblin@sisco.com. Not that G in there. Um I think I autocorrected there. That Um I think I autocorrected there. That Um I think I autocorrected there. That is great. I did go over these slides is great. I did go over these slides is great. I did go over these slides last night. Um my website is last night. Um my website is last night. Um my website is jerry.gamblin. Gamblin, jerry.gamblin. Gamblin, jerry.gamblin. Gamblin, jerrygamblin.com and uh I run cve.iciu jerrygamblin.com and uh I run cve.iciu jerrygamblin.com and uh I run cve.iciu which you might have seen in the past. which you might have seen in the past. which you might have seen in the past. Um it just produces vulnerability data Um it just produces vulnerability data Um it just produces vulnerability data reports every day so that you can look reports every day so that you can look reports every day so that you can look at those inside your company and just at those inside your company and just at those inside your company and just get an idea of what's happening in the get an idea of what's happening in the get an idea of what's happening in the CVE world. Uh so the rough agenda is CVE world. Uh so the rough agenda is CVE world. Uh so the rough agenda is they gave me a two-hour slot when I ask they gave me a two-hour slot when I ask they gave me a two-hour slot when I ask it asked for an hour slot. So I do not have Was that a duck? Awesome. So I have about a duck? Awesome. So I have about a duck? Awesome. So I have about a 15minute slide presentation and then 15minute slide presentation and then 15minute slide presentation and then about 45 minutes of stuff we can work about 45 minutes of stuff we can work about 45 minutes of stuff we can work through in Jupiter notebooks on my through in Jupiter notebooks on my through in Jupiter notebooks on my binder. So, if you want to look at the binder. So, if you want to look at the binder. So, if you want to look at the agenda right now and pick something else agenda right now and pick something else agenda right now and pick something else out for like the 11th or for like the out for like the 11th or for like the out for like the 11th or for like the 12:30 slot or 1:30 slot, you'll be done 12:30 slot or 1:30 slot, you'll be done 12:30 slot or 1:30 slot, you'll be done with that uh super fast. Uh yeah, I I with that uh super fast. Uh yeah, I I with that uh super fast. Uh yeah, I I wanted to teach this as a workshop and wanted to teach this as a workshop and wanted to teach this as a workshop and we went back and forth like are we going we went back and forth like are we going we went back and forth like are we going to stream this? I'm like I want to show to stream this? I'm like I want to show to stream this? I'm like I want to show people code and help them run the code. people code and help them run the code. people code and help them run the code. So, I have no idea how this is going to So, I have no idea how this is going to So, I have no idea how this is going to go in reality. So, you guys are learning go in reality. So, you guys are learning go in reality. So, you guys are learning with with with me. So, why this talk? Um, I want to me. So, why this talk? Um, I want to me. So, why this talk? Um, I want to make CVE data analysis more open and make CVE data analysis more open and make CVE data analysis more open and available to the public. Uh, I talk to available to the public. Uh, I talk to available to the public. Uh, I talk to people all the time and they don't people all the time and they don't people all the time and they don't understand the CVE data or even look at understand the CVE data or even look at understand the CVE data or even look at the CVE data very much and there aren't the CVE data very much and there aren't the CVE data very much and there aren't great open source projects out there great open source projects out there great open source projects out there that are taking that data and making it that are taking that data and making it that are taking that data and making it publicly available. So, I want to give publicly available. So, I want to give publicly available. So, I want to give you guys the tools to do that. Um sadly you guys the tools to do that. Um sadly you guys the tools to do that. Um sadly not sadly depending on your VC state not sadly depending on your VC state not sadly depending on your VC state there are a bunch of uh people who are there are a bunch of uh people who are there are a bunch of uh people who are taking this public data enriching it and taking this public data enriching it and taking this public data enriching it and then selling it. Um which you know I'm then selling it. Um which you know I'm then selling it. Um which you know I'm agnostic about it's whatever you want to agnostic about it's whatever you want to agnostic about it's whatever you want to do but but that's one reason to look at do but but that's one reason to look at do but but that's one reason to look at this data because it's all free and it this data because it's all free and it this data because it's all free and it takes very little time and effort to takes very little time and effort to takes very little time and effort to actually get to this data. Um actually get to this data. Um actually get to this data. Um vulnerability visilizations work and vulnerability visilizations work and vulnerability visilizations work and work really well. I post something like work really well. I post something like work really well. I post something like this on LinkedIn every month and it this on LinkedIn every month and it this on LinkedIn every month and it always gets a million likes, right? It's always gets a million likes, right? It's always gets a million likes, right? It's just a simple graph that says how many just a simple graph that says how many just a simple graph that says how many new CVEes there are this month versus new CVEes there are this month versus new CVEes there are this month versus last year. Um, people love it. It kind last year. Um, people love it. It kind last year. Um, people love it. It kind of gives this gives us there. I want to of gives this gives us there. I want to of gives this gives us there. I want to be able to give this to to everybody who be able to give this to to everybody who be able to give this to to everybody who is who wants to build these kind of is who wants to build these kind of is who wants to build these kind of graphs themselves. It's super easy. graphs themselves. It's super easy. graphs themselves. It's super easy. Um the third reason is because nobody Um the third reason is because nobody Um the third reason is because nobody looks at the data second. Haha. So, I write a data second. Haha. So, I write a data second. Haha. So, I write a personal blog. I write a personal blog. I write a personal blog. I write a personal blog. blog. blog. Yes. So, I write a personal blog on the Yes. So, I write a personal blog on the Yes. So, I write a personal blog on the 1 of every January. It's kind of just 1 of every January. It's kind of just 1 of every January. It's kind of just something I do. I just sit down and like something I do. I just sit down and like something I do. I just sit down and like go through and crush all the numbers. I go through and crush all the numbers. I go through and crush all the numbers. I I wrote my blog this year. Um, my boss I wrote my blog this year. Um, my boss I wrote my blog this year. Um, my boss emailed me and said, "Why is there an emailed me and said, "Why is there an emailed me and said, "Why is there an individual's contributor's name on there individual's contributor's name on there individual's contributor's name on there for Cisco's email address? That should for Cisco's email address? That should for Cisco's email address? That should be PERT." And I'm like, I I just pulled be PERT." And I'm like, I I just pulled be PERT." And I'm like, I I just pulled the data, right? Like, I'm not adding the data, right? Like, I'm not adding the data, right? Like, I'm not adding individuals email addresses. And they're individuals email addresses. And they're individuals email addresses. And they're like, where'd you get this data? I'm like, where'd you get this data? I'm like, where'd you get this data? I'm like, the NVD like, oh, this has to be a like, the NVD like, oh, this has to be a like, the NVD like, oh, this has to be a mistake. We went back and looked and it mistake. We went back and looked and it mistake. We went back and looked and it was like that for 10 years. And nobody was like that for 10 years. And nobody was like that for 10 years. And nobody at Cisco knew that because they were at Cisco knew that because they were at Cisco knew that because they were they were submitting the right data to they were submitting the right data to they were submitting the right data to CVE. They didn't understand that the NVD CVE. They didn't understand that the NVD CVE. They didn't understand that the NVD then takes the data and maps it to a then takes the data and maps it to a then takes the data and maps it to a totally private database of email totally private database of email totally private database of email addresses and then puts that in the CVE addresses and then puts that in the CVE addresses and then puts that in the CVE record. record. record. So interesting. Uh, so if you're, you So interesting. Uh, so if you're, you So interesting. Uh, so if you're, you know, it was a fire drill on my part know, it was a fire drill on my part know, it was a fire drill on my part because somebody thought I was messing because somebody thought I was messing because somebody thought I was messing around and putting an individual's email around and putting an individual's email around and putting an individual's email address in there. Just something that we address in there. Just something that we address in there. Just something that we didn't notice. Right. So, another thing didn't notice. Right. So, another thing didn't notice. Right. So, another thing is if you're a CNA, you're interested is if you're a CNA, you're interested is if you're a CNA, you're interested seeing how the data flows through the seeing how the data flows through the seeing how the data flows through the system, especially the place at the at system, especially the place at the at system, especially the place at the at the end where people look at the data is the end where people look at the data is the end where people look at the data is a good way to figure out who is looking a good way to figure out who is looking a good way to figure out who is looking at it and what it looks like on the end at it and what it looks like on the end at it and what it looks like on the end point. point. point. Um, the second reason is I love the CVE Um, the second reason is I love the CVE Um, the second reason is I love the CVE program. Nobody uses their data. I I I program. Nobody uses their data. I I I program. Nobody uses their data. I I I will I will say that kind of flatly and will I will say that kind of flatly and will I will say that kind of flatly and sadly. Um, I look at GitHub all the sadly. Um, I look at GitHub all the sadly. Um, I look at GitHub all the time. Nobody is cloning in the CBE v5 time. Nobody is cloning in the CBE v5 time. Nobody is cloning in the CBE v5 list and using that raw data for list and using that raw data for list and using that raw data for visualizations or for data. Everybody is visualizations or for data. Everybody is visualizations or for data. Everybody is still using the NVD program. still using the NVD program. still using the NVD program. Um, you will get some people who say Um, you will get some people who say Um, you will get some people who say they use CVE list and those are normally they use CVE list and those are normally they use CVE list and those are normally large companies who have very large companies who have very large companies who have very sophisticated ETL programs that bring sophisticated ETL programs that bring sophisticated ETL programs that bring that in and normalize it. But if you as that in and normalize it. But if you as that in and normalize it. But if you as an individual want to look at the data, an individual want to look at the data, an individual want to look at the data, is it easier to grab one NVD JSON L file is it easier to grab one NVD JSON L file is it easier to grab one NVD JSON L file or 25,000 individual JSON files and put or 25,000 individual JSON files and put or 25,000 individual JSON files and put those all together, right? Like it's a those all together, right? Like it's a those all together, right? Like it's a choice that was made. But but part of my choice that was made. But but part of my choice that was made. But but part of my choice here is to get people looking at choice here is to get people looking at choice here is to get people looking at the cbe.org data and understanding while the cbe.org data and understanding while the cbe.org data and understanding while it's out there and it's hard to use, it it's out there and it's hard to use, it it's out there and it's hard to use, it is doable and I provide some code on how is doable and I provide some code on how is doable and I provide some code on how to use to use to use that. Uh so the workshop goal is I'm that. Uh so the workshop goal is I'm that. Uh so the workshop goal is I'm going to give you guys a bunch of going to give you guys a bunch of going to give you guys a bunch of Jupyter notebooks. They're all set up. Jupyter notebooks. They're all set up. Jupyter notebooks. They're all set up. Uh they're in a repo. I want you guys Uh they're in a repo. I want you guys Uh they're in a repo. I want you guys look at them afterwards. The repo allows look at them afterwards. The repo allows look at them afterwards. The repo allows you to clone in the data, look at the you to clone in the data, look at the you to clone in the data, look at the data, and explore it. Um, we're going to data, and explore it. Um, we're going to data, and explore it. Um, we're going to spend some time and just walk through a spend some time and just walk through a spend some time and just walk through a couple of base couple of base couple of base uh base notebooks that I created. And uh base notebooks that I created. And uh base notebooks that I created. And then from that point, we're going to go then from that point, we're going to go then from that point, we're going to go ahead and ahead and ahead and uh just have some free time to try to uh just have some free time to try to uh just have some free time to try to build. And if anybody has any questions, build. And if anybody has any questions, build. And if anybody has any questions, I'm I'm happy to help. So, the data sources are pretty help. So, the data sources are pretty help. So, the data sources are pretty simple. Um, we're use the NVD 2.0 API. simple. Um, we're use the NVD 2.0 API. simple. Um, we're use the NVD 2.0 API. For ease of use, I run a website called For ease of use, I run a website called For ease of use, I run a website called nvd.handsonhacking.org. It hosts one nvd.handsonhacking.org. It hosts one nvd.handsonhacking.org. It hosts one file, and that's an NVD.json L file that file, and that's an NVD.json L file that file, and that's an NVD.json L file that has every CVE record in it, and it's has every CVE record in it, and it's has every CVE record in it, and it's updated um every four hours or updated um every four hours or updated um every four hours or something. I just needed a place to do something. I just needed a place to do something. I just needed a place to do this without running it all the time. I this without running it all the time. I this without running it all the time. I put the code that actually runs on that put the code that actually runs on that put the code that actually runs on that scraper machine in this repo that I'm scraper machine in this repo that I'm scraper machine in this repo that I'm going to show you and we will and you going to show you and we will and you going to show you and we will and you can grab that and run your own copy can grab that and run your own copy can grab that and run your own copy because while we're using it in this because while we're using it in this because while we're using it in this workshop there's no guarantee that that workshop there's no guarantee that that workshop there's no guarantee that that stays up forever. There's no gu there's stays up forever. There's no gu there's stays up forever. There's no gu there's no SLA provided with that right that's a no SLA provided with that right that's a no SLA provided with that right that's a personal resource that I run for my own personal resource that I run for my own personal resource that I run for my own convenience and you know if Amazon wants convenience and you know if Amazon wants convenience and you know if Amazon wants to take it down or if my credit card to take it down or if my credit card to take it down or if my credit card expires and I forget to update it might expires and I forget to update it might expires and I forget to update it might go away. So, please don't build your go away. So, please don't build your go away. So, please don't build your your workrelated processes off of my your workrelated processes off of my your workrelated processes off of my personal projects. Um, the second thing personal projects. Um, the second thing personal projects. Um, the second thing we're going to look at is the CVE list, we're going to look at is the CVE list, we're going to look at is the CVE list, the version five. Um, we're just going the version five. Um, we're just going the version five. Um, we're just going to pull down the 2025 to pull down the 2025 to pull down the 2025 CVEes for for ease of use to keep it CVEes for for ease of use to keep it CVEes for for ease of use to keep it small. small. small. The problem with that is the CBE program The problem with that is the CBE program The problem with that is the CBE program decided to list them by decided to list them by decided to list them by identifiers and not all CBES published identifiers and not all CBES published identifiers and not all CBES published in 2025 are in the CVE 2025 list. Uh in 2025 are in the CVE 2025 list. Uh in 2025 are in the CVE 2025 list. Uh when I ran this last night, there are when I ran this last night, there are when I ran this last night, there are about 8,000 while about 14 12,000 to about 8,000 while about 14 12,000 to about 8,000 while about 14 12,000 to 13,000 CVES have been published this 13,000 CVES have been published this 13,000 CVES have been published this year. Uh that that is one of the issues year. Uh that that is one of the issues year. Uh that that is one of the issues with the CVE list repo. There's no easy with the CVE list repo. There's no easy with the CVE list repo. There's no easy way to say, "Hey, I want all the CVEes way to say, "Hey, I want all the CVEes way to say, "Hey, I want all the CVEes published this year." Um, I talked to published this year." Um, I talked to published this year." Um, I talked to them about it. They they don't seem it's them about it. They they don't seem it's them about it. They they don't seem it's a big deal. They just want you to to get a big deal. They just want you to to get a big deal. They just want you to to get clone the whole repo and to look at the clone the whole repo and to look at the clone the whole repo and to look at the data thing. So, it's it's a little iffy, data thing. So, it's it's a little iffy, data thing. So, it's it's a little iffy, but we don't have time to do that and but we don't have time to do that and but we don't have time to do that and the system we're going to use is kind of the system we're going to use is kind of the system we're going to use is kind of limited on space. So, so we won't be limited on space. So, so we won't be limited on space. So, so we won't be doing that. Um, technology used, we're doing that. Um, technology used, we're doing that. Um, technology used, we're going to use Jupyter notebooks, pandas, going to use Jupyter notebooks, pandas, going to use Jupyter notebooks, pandas, mattplot lib, and my binder. Has anybody mattplot lib, and my binder. Has anybody mattplot lib, and my binder. Has anybody used these technologies before? Yeah. So, my binder is hosted by before? Yeah. So, my binder is hosted by before? Yeah. So, my binder is hosted by OV and a couple of other open source OV and a couple of other open source OV and a couple of other open source communities and it allows you to to run communities and it allows you to to run communities and it allows you to to run GitHub repos in Jupyter notebooks, GitHub repos in Jupyter notebooks, GitHub repos in Jupyter notebooks, Jupyter Notebook GitHub repos for free Jupyter Notebook GitHub repos for free Jupyter Notebook GitHub repos for free in the cloud. Uh, no log on, no off. I in the cloud. Uh, no log on, no off. I in the cloud. Uh, no log on, no off. I was thinking about using Google Collab was thinking about using Google Collab was thinking about using Google Collab for this, but they don't have a way to for this, but they don't have a way to for this, but they don't have a way to do no off and to clone in repos this do no off and to clone in repos this do no off and to clone in repos this easily. So, we're going to use my binder easily. So, we're going to use my binder easily. So, we're going to use my binder uh for this. It's way easier. Um, uh for this. It's way easier. Um, uh for this. It's way easier. Um, so here are the so here are the so here are the links. We can either type those in. I links. We can either type those in. I links. We can either type those in. I dropped the link to the repo in the dropped the link to the repo in the dropped the link to the repo in the Discord channel if you're in the Discord Discord channel if you're in the Discord Discord channel if you're in the Discord channel. Um, other than that, let let's just go Um, other than that, let let's just go Um, other than that, let let's just go to the top one and there's a link on the to the top one and there's a link on the to the top one and there's a link on the bottom for that once we get bottom for that once we get bottom for that once we get started. So, notes, please ask started. So, notes, please ask started. So, notes, please ask questions. This is the interactive part. questions. This is the interactive part. questions. This is the interactive part. This is the part where I thought that I This is the part where I thought that I This is the part where I thought that I was going to be teaching a class and not was going to be teaching a class and not was going to be teaching a class and not giving a lecture. So, that's kind of giving a lecture. So, that's kind of giving a lecture. So, that's kind of what I what I prepared for. Uh, this is what I what I prepared for. Uh, this is what I what I prepared for. Uh, this is a hybrid course. If you have any a hybrid course. If you have any a hybrid course. If you have any technical questions, uh, if you would technical questions, uh, if you would technical questions, uh, if you would put the technical questions in Discord, put the technical questions in Discord, put the technical questions in Discord, if you're on there, it'd be much easier if you're on there, it'd be much easier if you're on there, it'd be much easier for me to understand the question and we for me to understand the question and we for me to understand the question and we can kind of do it from there. I'll pull can kind of do it from there. I'll pull can kind of do it from there. I'll pull Discord up here. Um, like I said, I have Discord up here. Um, like I said, I have Discord up here. Um, like I said, I have about eight notebooks to show you guys about eight notebooks to show you guys about eight notebooks to show you guys and then I'm happy to stick around and and then I'm happy to stick around and and then I'm happy to stick around and help people build individual notebooks help people build individual notebooks help people build individual notebooks and answer the, "Hey, how would you and answer the, "Hey, how would you and answer the, "Hey, how would you visualize this this question?" Um, it's visualize this this question?" Um, it's visualize this this question?" Um, it's really great. If you're not familiar really great. If you're not familiar really great. If you're not familiar with the data, I will tell you that the with the data, I will tell you that the with the data, I will tell you that the AI codebots are great at Jupiter and AI codebots are great at Jupiter and AI codebots are great at Jupiter and pandas. Um, if you have one of those on pandas. Um, if you have one of those on pandas. Um, if you have one of those on your machine, you can use it. Uh, there your machine, you can use it. Uh, there your machine, you can use it. Uh, there are instructions in the repo on how to are instructions in the repo on how to are instructions in the repo on how to clone the the repo to your local clone the the repo to your local clone the the repo to your local machine. If you want to run it locally machine. If you want to run it locally machine. If you want to run it locally or run it on a cloud instance that you or run it on a cloud instance that you or run it on a cloud instance that you have, you're more than welcome to do have, you're more than welcome to do have, you're more than welcome to do that, especially if you want to save the that, especially if you want to save the that, especially if you want to save the changes. changes. changes. Uh, so the last note is there's possible Uh, so the last note is there's possible Uh, so the last note is there's possible demo issues on the North Carolina state demo issues on the North Carolina state demo issues on the North Carolina state Wi-Fi. So I put this demo together. I Wi-Fi. So I put this demo together. I Wi-Fi. So I put this demo together. I tried it at Starbucks. I tried at my tried it at Starbucks. I tried at my tried it at Starbucks. I tried at my house. It worked last night on the slow house. It worked last night on the slow house. It worked last night on the slow motel network. Uh, I get it here. I run motel network. Uh, I get it here. I run motel network. Uh, I get it here. I run a few of the notebooks and I get this a few of the notebooks and I get this a few of the notebooks and I get this server connection error and then you server connection error and then you server connection error and then you just lose all your work because it's just lose all your work because it's just lose all your work because it's it's stateless. Uh so what I will say is it's stateless. Uh so what I will say is it's stateless. Uh so what I will say is is we'll try uh if not I know all of is we'll try uh if not I know all of is we'll try uh if not I know all of these notebooks work and if you go home these notebooks work and if you go home these notebooks work and if you go home and you want to run them that's fine and and you want to run them that's fine and and you want to run them that's fine and then you can just email me questions if then you can just email me questions if then you can just email me questions if if you have if you have if you have them. Okay, before we jump into the them. Okay, before we jump into the them. Okay, before we jump into the demo, does anybody have any questions demo, does anybody have any questions demo, does anybody have any questions about the data or overall process before about the data or overall process before about the data or overall process before we get started? Check disc. All right. Nice. So, here's the repo. Uh, it has Nice. So, here's the repo. Uh, it has Nice. So, here's the repo. Uh, it has all the the notebooks in here broken all the the notebooks in here broken all the the notebooks in here broken down. I also put the latest presentation down. I also put the latest presentation down. I also put the latest presentation in the in the presentation file folder. in the in the presentation file folder. in the in the presentation file folder. So, if you want to grab it, look at the So, if you want to grab it, look at the So, if you want to grab it, look at the slides, it's it's slides, it's it's slides, it's it's there. there. there. Uh, so once again, the the URL, if Uh, so once again, the the URL, if Uh, so once again, the the URL, if you're having trouble, it's github.comjamblin workshop. Oh, no problem at all. All right, that sounds all. All right, that sounds all. All right, that sounds better. Uh, if you just want to go down better. Uh, if you just want to go down better. Uh, if you just want to go down if if you're going to do the binder if if you're going to do the binder if if you're going to do the binder part, and that's what I'm going to work part, and that's what I'm going to work part, and that's what I'm going to work on, you can click the launch binder on, you can click the launch binder on, you can click the launch binder here, and it will launch you into a new here, and it will launch you into a new here, and it will launch you into a new window here. It's going to build a window here. It's going to build a window here. It's going to build a Docker container that's going to run Docker container that's going to run Docker container that's going to run Jupyter Lab for us. It's going to pull Jupyter Lab for us. It's going to pull Jupyter Lab for us. It's going to pull in all of the the requirements out of in all of the the requirements out of in all of the the requirements out of the requirements.ext and build this. the requirements.ext and build this. the requirements.ext and build this. It's it's super simple and it's super It's it's super simple and it's super It's it's super simple and it's super slick. Uh this is one of my favorite slick. Uh this is one of my favorite slick. Uh this is one of my favorite open source projects. So if you're open source projects. So if you're open source projects. So if you're interested in donating to them, it's interested in donating to them, it's interested in donating to them, it's it's a great use outside of any it's a great use outside of any it's a great use outside of any technology kicups we have with the Wi-Fi. So the first thing we're going to Wi-Fi. So the first thing we're going to Wi-Fi. So the first thing we're going to do is we're going to go into the data do is we're going to go into the data do is we're going to go into the data folder. And then there are two files in folder. And then there are two files in folder. And then there are two files in here. There's an NVD API. py. Um, we here. There's an NVD API. py. Um, we here. There's an NVD API. py. Um, we won't use that, but this is here if you won't use that, but this is here if you won't use that, but this is here if you want to download your own copy of all want to download your own copy of all want to download your own copy of all the CVE records uh in JSONL format and the CVE records uh in JSONL format and the CVE records uh in JSONL format and put it in one file. It's how it's how I put it in one file. It's how it's how I put it in one file. It's how it's how I do. Um, this is the code I'm running. do. Um, this is the code I'm running. do. Um, this is the code I'm running. Uh, it's pretty simple. You just go and Uh, it's pretty simple. You just go and Uh, it's pretty simple. You just go and put your your API key in there and then put your your API key in there and then put your your API key in there and then set it to run on a crown job and and it set it to run on a crown job and and it set it to run on a crown job and and it works. So, it's not pretty, but it does works. So, it's not pretty, but it does works. So, it's not pretty, but it does work. work. work. So here is the data uh notebook that we So here is the data uh notebook that we So here is the data uh notebook that we are going to run. So what this notebook are going to run. So what this notebook are going to run. So what this notebook is going to do pretty simple is it going is going to do pretty simple is it going is going to do pretty simple is it going to to to download click something. So what this will do it will something. So what this will do it will something. So what this will do it will download that MVD JSONL file to a local download that MVD JSONL file to a local download that MVD JSONL file to a local folder here. Um it'll download the CVE folder here. Um it'll download the CVE folder here. Um it'll download the CVE files from the GitHub repo. files from the GitHub repo. files from the GitHub repo. There's a limited amount of space. I There's a limited amount of space. I There's a limited amount of space. I think like three gigs you can save on think like three gigs you can save on think like three gigs you can save on these. So, we're just pulling 2025. If these. So, we're just pulling 2025. If these. So, we're just pulling 2025. If you're running this at home or you want you're running this at home or you want you're running this at home or you want to go use another year's data later to go use another year's data later to go use another year's data later here, all you do is you change the here, all you do is you change the here, all you do is you change the sparse folder from 2025 to 2024 or 2020 sparse folder from 2025 to 2024 or 2020 sparse folder from 2025 to 2024 or 2020 or you just get rid of it all together, or you just get rid of it all together, or you just get rid of it all together, the 2025, and it'll download all the the 2025, and it'll download all the the 2025, and it'll download all the CVEes in the repo. And then we're also CVEes in the repo. And then we're also CVEes in the repo. And then we're also going to download the schema file. So, going to download the schema file. So, going to download the schema file. So, we can look at that. They're uh pretty we can look at that. They're uh pretty we can look at that. They're uh pretty desperate or pretty pretty separate desperate or pretty pretty separate desperate or pretty pretty separate locations. So, there are three cells locations. So, there are three cells locations. So, there are three cells that do that. Uh if you want to click that do that. Uh if you want to click that do that. Uh if you want to click this little double arrow button up here this little double arrow button up here this little double arrow button up here at the top, that'll run all of the cells at the top, that'll run all of the cells at the top, that'll run all of the cells for you. So, it will take some time like I you. So, it will take some time like I you. So, it will take some time like I said like this MVD file is 1.3 gig. said like this MVD file is 1.3 gig. said like this MVD file is 1.3 gig. still to take some time to download that still to take some time to download that still to take some time to download that and then we'll go to the GitHub repo and and then we'll go to the GitHub repo and and then we'll go to the GitHub repo and download uh the 2025 data and this is the part where it's data and this is the part where it's data and this is the part where it's more like a class. I don't have anything more like a class. I don't have anything more like a class. I don't have anything to say while this downloads. So if you to say while this downloads. So if you to say while this downloads. So if you have any questions have any questions have any questions or just so uh it's writing the file to NVD just so uh it's writing the file to NVD just so uh it's writing the file to NVD file path. Yeah, the MVD file path is file path. Yeah, the MVD file path is file path. Yeah, the MVD file path is just this folder in slash data called just this folder in slash data called just this folder in slash data called NVD. Sorry. NVD. Sorry. NVD. Sorry. Okay, there you go. Thanks. And then it'll grab the the GitHub repo And then it'll grab the the GitHub repo And then it'll grab the the GitHub repo and pull that down in a shallow clone. Yep. My specialty is filling awkward My specialty is filling awkward My specialty is filling awkward silences. So keep an eye out in case silences. So keep an eye out in case silences. So keep an eye out in case anyone else wants to jump in. Um, this anyone else wants to jump in. Um, this anyone else wants to jump in. Um, this is cool. is cool. is cool. Um, what limitations are obviously you Um, what limitations are obviously you Um, what limitations are obviously you said there was 3 gig of disc in this said there was 3 gig of disc in this said there was 3 gig of disc in this thing. What what's the bandwidth thing. What what's the bandwidth thing. What what's the bandwidth limitations? I haven't I haven't found limitations? I haven't I haven't found limitations? I haven't I haven't found one. That's the reason I use it, right? one. That's the reason I use it, right? one. That's the reason I use it, right? Like it's it's fairly fast. Like I Like it's it's fairly fast. Like I Like it's it's fairly fast. Like I downloaded 1.5 gig in 45 seconds, which downloaded 1.5 gig in 45 seconds, which downloaded 1.5 gig in 45 seconds, which is great for free service and great to is great for free service and great to is great for free service and great to for teaching. Um, yeah. Yeah. I've not for teaching. Um, yeah. Yeah. I've not for teaching. Um, yeah. Yeah. I've not tried to stress it out or whatever, but tried to stress it out or whatever, but tried to stress it out or whatever, but I'm super happy with it. Yeah, I'm just I'm super happy with it. Yeah, I'm just I'm super happy with it. Yeah, I'm just Yeah, got so many questions, right? Yeah, got so many questions, right? Yeah, got so many questions, right? Like, like we're all doing this right Like, like we're all doing this right Like, like we're all doing this right now. So, obviously, we're all cloning now. So, obviously, we're all cloning now. So, obviously, we're all cloning this down. So, it's going to have a this down. So, it's going to have a this down. So, it's going to have a little spike in its bandwidth ra can it little spike in its bandwidth ra can it little spike in its bandwidth ra can it do cells in parallel? Could could it be do cells in parallel? Could could it be do cells in parallel? Could could it be downloading the schema files whilst it's downloading the schema files whilst it's downloading the schema files whilst it's downloading the uh it probably could, downloading the uh it probably could, downloading the uh it probably could, but I try to keep this simple and it's but I try to keep this simple and it's but I try to keep this simple and it's just just one after the other. So, yeah. just just one after the other. So, yeah. just just one after the other. So, yeah. Cool. All right. So, after those all Cool. All right. So, after those all Cool. All right. So, after those all run, it should take three or four run, it should take three or four run, it should take three or four minutes. You have all your data in that minutes. You have all your data in that minutes. You have all your data in that data folder. Uh we'll start looking at data folder. Uh we'll start looking at data folder. Uh we'll start looking at the CVE program first. So if you click the CVE program first. So if you click the CVE program first. So if you click on the CVE program folder, let's look at on the CVE program folder, let's look at on the CVE program folder, let's look at the schema, the CVE schema file. Uh if the schema, the CVE schema file. Uh if the schema, the CVE schema file. Uh if you just run that folder, run that run you just run that folder, run that run you just run that folder, run that run that notebook, it'll it should be very that notebook, it'll it should be very that notebook, it'll it should be very fast. If it works, um, it's going to fast. If it works, um, it's going to fast. If it works, um, it's going to create you create you create you a new folder in here with the a new folder in here with the a new folder in here with the files that will show you what the CVE files that will show you what the CVE files that will show you what the CVE schema looks like broken down. So later schema looks like broken down. So later schema looks like broken down. So later on when you want to come in and and on when you want to come in and and on when you want to come in and and build out and say, "Hey, I'm missing a build out and say, "Hey, I'm missing a build out and say, "Hey, I'm missing a piece of data or you know what's that piece of data or you know what's that piece of data or you know what's that that limited under?" Uh, you can find it that limited under?" Uh, you can find it that limited under?" Uh, you can find it here. We can also go back and this is what I We can also go back and this is what I We can also go back and this is what I like to use like to use like to use to to kind of torment the schema people to to kind of torment the schema people to to kind of torment the schema people because these aren't complete. Uh only because these aren't complete. Uh only because these aren't complete. Uh only 62% of the keys have descriptions in the 62% of the keys have descriptions in the 62% of the keys have descriptions in the CVE2 schema and only 50% have type, CVE2 schema and only 50% have type, CVE2 schema and only 50% have type, right? So while they have a schema, it right? So while they have a schema, it right? So while they have a schema, it it's not complete and it could use some it's not complete and it could use some it's not complete and it could use some work. Uh 7% have patterns. That's that's work. Uh 7% have patterns. That's that's work. Uh 7% have patterns. That's that's also interesting. Um, if you go to my also interesting. Um, if you go to my also interesting. Um, if you go to my talk tomorrow about the imperative for talk tomorrow about the imperative for talk tomorrow about the imperative for CVE data quality, we'll talk about that. CVE data quality, we'll talk about that. CVE data quality, we'll talk about that. Um, the pattern is the only data quality Um, the pattern is the only data quality Um, the pattern is the only data quality match that they do at this point in the match that they do at this point in the match that they do at this point in the CVE program. Uh, CVE program. Uh, CVE program. Uh, pre-publishing post-publishing people pre-publishing post-publishing people pre-publishing post-publishing people can look at it and complain, but they can look at it and complain, but they can look at it and complain, but they don't have a very advanced QA process don't have a very advanced QA process don't have a very advanced QA process now to look at that. Um that is now to look at that. Um that is now to look at that. Um that is something that I am trying to get on a something that I am trying to get on a something that I am trying to get on a bandwagon of saying hey we need to do bandwagon of saying hey we need to do bandwagon of saying hey we need to do something I don't like to use the ML and something I don't like to use the ML and something I don't like to use the ML and AI word but like just any kind of AI word but like just any kind of AI word but like just any kind of automated testing because if you go and automated testing because if you go and automated testing because if you go and look at these uh you look at the schema look at these uh you look at the schema look at these uh you look at the schema I think the I think the I think the minimum for the description is one minimum for the description is one minimum for the description is one character. So you can legally publish a character. So you can legally publish a character. So you can legally publish a CVE with a description of one character CVE with a description of one character CVE with a description of one character and a CVE ID, right? And it would and a CVE ID, right? And it would and a CVE ID, right? And it would publish and go through and end up on publish and go through and end up on publish and go through and end up on cve.org. Hopefully then somebody in the cve.org. Hopefully then somebody in the cve.org. Hopefully then somebody in the community would say, "Hey, this is community would say, "Hey, this is community would say, "Hey, this is terrible. Please fix it." But, you know, terrible. Please fix it." But, you know, terrible. Please fix it." But, you know, sometimes things just just pass through. Yes. Yeah, I get I'm on your bandwagon. Yeah, I get I'm on your bandwagon. Yeah, I get I'm on your bandwagon. Um, what have your thoughts been about Um, what have your thoughts been about Um, what have your thoughts been about just sending a boatload of PRs to fix just sending a boatload of PRs to fix just sending a boatload of PRs to fix some of those very simply fixable uh some of those very simply fixable uh some of those very simply fixable uh schema validation things? Because to me, schema validation things? Because to me, schema validation things? Because to me, this is a no-brainer. This should just this is a no-brainer. This should just this is a no-brainer. This should just be better. Yeah. Yeah. I I I be better. Yeah. Yeah. I I I be better. Yeah. Yeah. I I I I know how they're doing it. I sit on I know how they're doing it. I sit on I know how they're doing it. I sit on the quality working group. are having the quality working group. are having the quality working group. are having discussions about how to fix the the discussions about how to fix the the discussions about how to fix the the schema schema schema and they're having issues. We we can dig and they're having issues. We we can dig and they're having issues. We we can dig into it here. We'll have time. into it here. We'll have time. into it here. We'll have time. Um right now the CVE program does not Um right now the CVE program does not Um right now the CVE program does not own any of the major tooling that is own any of the major tooling that is own any of the major tooling that is used by C by by CNAs to publish CVES. used by C by by CNAs to publish CVES. used by C by by CNAs to publish CVES. Uh it's all open source and open source Uh it's all open source and open source Uh it's all open source and open source means that people work on it when they means that people work on it when they means that people work on it when they can. Uh last year the CV program got can. Uh last year the CV program got can. Uh last year the CV program got hung up because the volcon or the hung up because the volcon or the hung up because the volcon or the volagram guy was unavailable with a work volagram guy was unavailable with a work volagram guy was unavailable with a work thing or whatever to update the schema thing or whatever to update the schema thing or whatever to update the schema in vol. So they had to push a whole in vol. So they had to push a whole in vol. So they had to push a whole release from there. I think I think release from there. I think I think release from there. I think I think updating the schema is something that we updating the schema is something that we updating the schema is something that we should be able to do. I also think the should be able to do. I also think the should be able to do. I also think the CVE program should take ownership or CVE program should take ownership or CVE program should take ownership or some form of responsibility for the some form of responsibility for the some form of responsibility for the major uh CVE publishing major uh CVE publishing major uh CVE publishing tools. That's, you know, I think that's tools. That's, you know, I think that's tools. That's, you know, I think that's also one of those things that will get also one of those things that will get also one of those things that will get some push back, but is one of the some push back, but is one of the some push back, but is one of the long-term goals if you want to make CVE long-term goals if you want to make CVE long-term goals if you want to make CVE a a great standard moving forward is a a great standard moving forward is a a great standard moving forward is that the CVE program needs to to have that the CVE program needs to to have that the CVE program needs to to have control over the tools that most people control over the tools that most people control over the tools that most people publish with. Uh even in a way where publish with. Uh even in a way where publish with. Uh even in a way where they can say, "Hey, we're not going to they can say, "Hey, we're not going to they can say, "Hey, we're not going to stop until X open source projects stop until X open source projects stop until X open source projects updated. We've updated the the CLI tool. updated. We've updated the the CLI tool. updated. We've updated the the CLI tool. We have the S SDK. we have and the guey We have the S SDK. we have and the guey We have the S SDK. we have and the guey we have, you know, everybody else can we have, you know, everybody else can we have, you know, everybody else can catch up at that catch up at that catch up at that point. So, the next thing we're going to point. So, the next thing we're going to point. So, the next thing we're going to look at is this CVE dataf look at is this CVE dataf look at is this CVE dataf frame. So, this is a data frame that's frame. So, this is a data frame that's frame. So, this is a data frame that's going to build your first data with all going to build your first data with all going to build your first data with all the CVE data in there. Uh, so I pull the the CVE data in there. Uh, so I pull the the CVE data in there. Uh, so I pull the data that I like to look at out of here. data that I like to look at out of here. data that I like to look at out of here. Like I said, there are 237 keys in the Like I said, there are 237 keys in the Like I said, there are 237 keys in the schema. That's why we did the schema schema. That's why we did the schema schema. That's why we did the schema first. you're more than happy to to add first. you're more than happy to to add first. you're more than happy to to add any of those schemas in here, but I any of those schemas in here, but I any of those schemas in here, but I basically just end up pooling these 15 basically just end up pooling these 15 basically just end up pooling these 15 things for for most use cases, right? things for for most use cases, right? things for for most use cases, right? CVE ID, what state it's in, uh it was CVE ID, what state it's in, uh it was CVE ID, what state it's in, uh it was reserved, the date it was published, and reserved, the date it was published, and reserved, the date it was published, and the date it was updated, right? And some the date it was updated, right? And some the date it was updated, right? And some CVs information, the CWE, the CNA short CVs information, the CWE, the CNA short CVs information, the CWE, the CNA short name, and what products are affected. name, and what products are affected. name, and what products are affected. So, this is pretty simple. It's pretty So, this is pretty simple. It's pretty So, this is pretty simple. It's pretty lightweight. It might work for some of lightweight. It might work for some of lightweight. It might work for some of your projects, but if you want to dig in your projects, but if you want to dig in your projects, but if you want to dig in deeper, you may have to go and and edit deeper, you may have to go and and edit deeper, you may have to go and and edit this. But this is a good baseline for this. But this is a good baseline for this. But this is a good baseline for most people to start with. So, this just creates a data with. So, this just creates a data with. So, this just creates a data frame. And a data frame, think of it as frame. And a data frame, think of it as frame. And a data frame, think of it as an in-memory an in-memory an in-memory uh database Excel spreadsheet, right? uh database Excel spreadsheet, right? uh database Excel spreadsheet, right? You can just pick which of these columns You can just pick which of these columns You can just pick which of these columns you want and then do data analysis on you want and then do data analysis on you want and then do data analysis on those columns. It's it's super easy and those columns. It's it's super easy and those columns. It's it's super easy and super super useful. If you dip your toes super super useful. If you dip your toes super super useful. If you dip your toes into data science, a lot of times you'll into data science, a lot of times you'll into data science, a lot of times you'll end up in a Jupyter notebook with pandas end up in a Jupyter notebook with pandas end up in a Jupyter notebook with pandas because it allows you to see the data because it allows you to see the data because it allows you to see the data visually and it allows you to do things visually and it allows you to do things visually and it allows you to do things like chunk up your code here so that you like chunk up your code here so that you like chunk up your code here so that you don't have to run 500 lines of code don't have to run 500 lines of code don't have to run 500 lines of code because if something breaks, it'll break because if something breaks, it'll break because if something breaks, it'll break in the cell and you can just fix that in the cell and you can just fix that in the cell and you can just fix that and continue on. The next thing we're going to look at is The next thing we're going to look at is The next thing we're going to look at is the CVE data quality. Remember how to use a Windows machine. So, this is going to simply machine. So, this is going to simply machine. So, this is going to simply rebuild that data frame that we built in rebuild that data frame that we built in rebuild that data frame that we built in that first picture and break it down and that first picture and break it down and that first picture and break it down and tell you what is in all of those tell you what is in all of those tell you what is in all of those cells. So, I like to look at this just cells. So, I like to look at this just cells. So, I like to look at this just to see how complete the data is that I'm to see how complete the data is that I'm to see how complete the data is that I'm working with. working with. working with. U as you can see somehow there are 59 CVEes with null see somehow there are 59 CVEes with null see somehow there are 59 CVEes with null date published in the in the CVE program date published in the in the CVE program date published in the in the CVE program data right like that would be something data right like that would be something data right like that would be something that I should go look at and figure out that I should go look at and figure out that I should go look at and figure out why why why uh but this is just taking the data and uh but this is just taking the data and uh but this is just taking the data and figuring out what's in the record and figuring out what's in the record and figuring out what's in the record and then parsing it. Uh there's probably then parsing it. Uh there's probably then parsing it. Uh there's probably answers to these because they do some answers to these because they do some answers to these because they do some weird stuff with rejected records that weird stuff with rejected records that weird stuff with rejected records that end up in in the end up in in the end up in in the cbe.org files. I'm not a huge fan of the cbe.org files. I'm not a huge fan of the cbe.org files. I'm not a huge fan of the way it works, but I understand that's way it works, but I understand that's way it works, but I understand that's why they do it. But I always like to use why they do it. But I always like to use why they do it. But I always like to use this just to see how complete the data this just to see how complete the data this just to see how complete the data is that I'm working with. Uh so we have is that I'm working with. Uh so we have is that I'm working with. Uh so we have 7,719 CVEes that are in this data lake 7,719 CVEes that are in this data lake 7,719 CVEes that are in this data lake right now that we're using. That's all right now that we're using. That's all right now that we're using. That's all the CVEes published as of five minutes the CVEes published as of five minutes the CVEes published as of five minutes ago that are CVE-2025. ago that are CVE-2025. ago that are CVE-2025. So, so we have a pretty full database So, so we have a pretty full database So, so we have a pretty full database there. We're going to go back up to the there. We're going to go back up to the there. We're going to go back up to the root cause here and go into the NVD root cause here and go into the NVD root cause here and go into the NVD program. We'll spend a little bit of program. We'll spend a little bit of program. We'll spend a little bit of time here because this is where I spend time here because this is where I spend time here because this is where I spend most of my time processing the data. most of my time processing the data. most of my time processing the data. Uh, so just for quality and and speed of Uh, so just for quality and and speed of Uh, so just for quality and and speed of time, we're just going to go right to time, we're just going to go right to time, we're just going to go right to the NVD data frame. The NVD schema and the NVD data frame. The NVD schema and the NVD data frame. The NVD schema and the NVD data quality are exact copies of the NVD data quality are exact copies of the NVD data quality are exact copies of the CVE program. they just run and then the CVE program. they just run and then the CVE program. they just run and then you get full data on on what the quality you get full data on on what the quality you get full data on on what the quality is there if you're interested in there. is there if you're interested in there. is there if you're interested in there. But there's no need of showing that that But there's no need of showing that that But there's no need of showing that that twice. It's twice. It's twice. It's just run this. Is everybody else able to just run this. Is everybody else able to just run this. Is everybody else able to keep up online that are trying or having keep up online that are trying or having keep up online that are trying or having any issues? I won issues? I won issues? I won myself. Let's try again. Yeah. Yeah. If if you definitely move Yeah. Yeah. If if you definitely move Yeah. Yeah. If if you definitely move the data loading to another notebook if the data loading to another notebook if the data loading to another notebook if you can or download it at home is is is you can or download it at home is is is you can or download it at home is is is is the right answer there. Um trying to is the right answer there. Um trying to is the right answer there. Um trying to just build it here is is causing some just build it here is is causing some just build it here is is causing some issues as you can see. doesn't do. Oh, and if you if you want doesn't do. Oh, and if you if you want doesn't do. Oh, and if you if you want to do the thing where you just open a to do the thing where you just open a to do the thing where you just open a notebook and run all cells, you don't notebook and run all cells, you don't notebook and run all cells, you don't want the cells that pull the data again want the cells that pull the data again want the cells that pull the data again that you already have. Yes, exactly. To that you already have. Yes, exactly. To that you already have. Yes, exactly. To be there. So, you want to offload to a be there. So, you want to offload to a be there. So, you want to offload to a different notebook and then crossloads different notebook and then crossloads different notebook and then crossloads into your active working one. Yep. 100%. into your active working one. Yep. 100%. into your active working one. Yep. 100%. Yeah, you're right. This is this is just Yeah, you're right. This is this is just Yeah, you're right. This is this is just base level stuff. I'm just trying there base level stuff. I'm just trying there base level stuff. I'm just trying there there are definitely ways to to do this. there are definitely ways to to do this. there are definitely ways to to do this. So, I'm going to have to reload and try So, I'm going to have to reload and try So, I'm going to have to reload and try again. So, welcome to the life of live again. So, welcome to the life of live again. So, welcome to the life of live demos. demos. demos. So, in this silence, why don't you tell So, in this silence, why don't you tell So, in this silence, why don't you tell us more about the history, like how long us more about the history, like how long us more about the history, like how long you've been doing this? Yep. Yep. No you've been doing this? Yep. Yep. No you've been doing this? Yep. Yep. No problem. So, I worked for the government problem. So, I worked for the government problem. So, I worked for the government for 10 years in the early part of my for 10 years in the early part of my for 10 years in the early part of my career doing government stuff. I then career doing government stuff. I then career doing government stuff. I then ran the security program for Carfax uh ran the security program for Carfax uh ran the security program for Carfax uh in the US. They're they were the world's in the US. They're they were the world's in the US. They're they were the world's largest data company at the time. They largest data company at the time. They largest data company at the time. They had something like 1,500 records for had something like 1,500 records for had something like 1,500 records for every car in the United States, like every car in the United States, like every car in the United States, like when you got your oil changed, the last when you got your oil changed, the last when you got your oil changed, the last time you got rotations, etc. So, I I time you got rotations, etc. So, I I time you got rotations, etc. So, I I worked in big data uh running their worked in big data uh running their worked in big data uh running their vulnerability management program uh vulnerability management program uh vulnerability management program uh vulnerability management program 10 vulnerability management program 10 vulnerability management program 10 years ago. Wasn't very good. It's not years ago. Wasn't very good. It's not years ago. Wasn't very good. It's not much better now to be honest, but I went much better now to be honest, but I went much better now to be honest, but I went and worked for a startup called Kenna and worked for a startup called Kenna and worked for a startup called Kenna Security. Uh five years ago, we were Security. Uh five years ago, we were Security. Uh five years ago, we were acquired by Cisco. I've been at Cisco acquired by Cisco. I've been at Cisco acquired by Cisco. I've been at Cisco for for these five years uh in their for for these five years uh in their for for these five years uh in their threat detection and response CTO group threat detection and response CTO group threat detection and response CTO group helping guide vulnerability data into helping guide vulnerability data into helping guide vulnerability data into all of the Cisco products. So we're all of the Cisco products. So we're all of the Cisco products. So we're we're trying really hard to to be on we're trying really hard to to be on we're trying really hard to to be on both sides here. We try really hard to both sides here. We try really hard to both sides here. We try really hard to push from the user side push from the user side push from the user side uh where we where we where I go to all uh where we where we where I go to all uh where we where we where I go to all the meetings and talk about the users the meetings and talk about the users the meetings and talk about the users and how we people use the data and why and how we people use the data and why and how we people use the data and why that data needs to go better. And then that data needs to go better. And then that data needs to go better. And then we have other people here who come from we have other people here who come from we have other people here who come from the other side of Cisco, Omar and the other side of Cisco, Omar and the other side of Cisco, Omar and company, who are CNA based and they're company, who are CNA based and they're company, who are CNA based and they're they're worried about how do you publish they're worried about how do you publish they're worried about how do you publish it? Uh over the last couple years, it's it? Uh over the last couple years, it's it? Uh over the last couple years, it's been really good because it seems like been really good because it seems like been really good because it seems like those two sides are finally coming those two sides are finally coming those two sides are finally coming together to think, hey, we got to do together to think, hey, we got to do together to think, hey, we got to do more than just throw this in the wind. more than just throw this in the wind. more than just throw this in the wind. We have to be able to make sure that the We have to be able to make sure that the We have to be able to make sure that the data we're putting out there is actually data we're putting out there is actually data we're putting out there is actually useful for the people in the end. useful for the people in the end. useful for the people in the end. Um, a personal opinion, for the longest Um, a personal opinion, for the longest Um, a personal opinion, for the longest time, uh, the CBE program time, uh, the CBE program time, uh, the CBE program just kind of outsourced all of that work just kind of outsourced all of that work just kind of outsourced all of that work to NVD. Everybody would just go look at to NVD. Everybody would just go look at to NVD. Everybody would just go look at the NVD for the data because they were the NVD for the data because they were the NVD for the data because they were doing all the enrichment. Um, with the doing all the enrichment. Um, with the doing all the enrichment. Um, with the government issues lately, that's not government issues lately, that's not government issues lately, that's not exactly a reliable path for for for exactly a reliable path for for for exactly a reliable path for for for people to do. So, we're really starting people to do. So, we're really starting people to do. So, we're really starting in the last 12 months to put more and in the last 12 months to put more and in the last 12 months to put more and more data into the actual CVE records, more data into the actual CVE records, more data into the actual CVE records, which is really good. And there are also which is really good. And there are also which is really good. And there are also other people who are companies that are other people who are companies that are other people who are companies that are trying to backfill that data. Uh, I trying to backfill that data. Uh, I trying to backfill that data. Uh, I don't work for old volc. I'm not I don't don't work for old volc. I'm not I don't don't work for old volc. I'm not I don't have any stock or any equity in that have any stock or any equity in that have any stock or any equity in that company, but they're doing a good job company, but they're doing a good job company, but they're doing a good job with their with their with their NVD++. Uh, the GitHub people have their NVD++. Uh, the GitHub people have their NVD++. Uh, the GitHub people have their database. Google has OSV.dev, which is database. Google has OSV.dev, which is database. Google has OSV.dev, which is good. And you know there there are a good. And you know there there are a good. And you know there there are a bunch of other open-source databases. bunch of other open-source databases. bunch of other open-source databases. The the problem here and a question I'll The the problem here and a question I'll The the problem here and a question I'll address tomorrow is who is the source of address tomorrow is who is the source of address tomorrow is who is the source of truth for CVE data? It always has to be truth for CVE data? It always has to be truth for CVE data? It always has to be someone because we're going to have someone because we're going to have someone because we're going to have desperate uh information in different desperate uh information in different desperate uh information in different databases. For the longest time I could databases. For the longest time I could databases. For the longest time I could point to the nvd.org and say, "Hey, this point to the nvd.org and say, "Hey, this point to the nvd.org and say, "Hey, this is what the CVSS is for this. We can is what the CVSS is for this. We can is what the CVSS is for this. We can have the discussion starting at this have the discussion starting at this have the discussion starting at this point, but I can't just take it off of point, but I can't just take it off of point, but I can't just take it off of off of anybody else's website, right? off of anybody else's website, right? off of anybody else's website, right? And we've kind of lost that who is the And we've kind of lost that who is the And we've kind of lost that who is the source of truth for CBE data recently. source of truth for CBE data recently. source of truth for CBE data recently. And to be honest, the ADPs that we've And to be honest, the ADPs that we've And to be honest, the ADPs that we've kind of launched has kind of muddied kind of launched has kind of muddied kind of launched has kind of muddied that water a little bit more because that water a little bit more because that water a little bit more because you'll have an ADP CVSS score and you'll have an ADP CVSS score and you'll have an ADP CVSS score and then the CVSS score that was published then the CVSS score that was published then the CVSS score that was published with the record. So, it can get really with the record. So, it can get really with the record. So, it can get really really messy really quick. And like like really messy really quick. And like like really messy really quick. And like like I tell people, I don't necessarily need I tell people, I don't necessarily need I tell people, I don't necessarily need the 100% right answer because you can the 100% right answer because you can the 100% right answer because you can always argue about CVSS vectors, CPEs, always argue about CVSS vectors, CPEs, always argue about CVSS vectors, CPEs, etc. I just need a starting point where etc. I just need a starting point where etc. I just need a starting point where when I'm talking to somebody from when I'm talking to somebody from when I'm talking to somebody from another company, we can say here's the another company, we can say here's the another company, we can say here's the data we're starting from. Like it's not data we're starting from. Like it's not data we're starting from. Like it's not a bring your own data fight to to talk a bring your own data fight to to talk a bring your own data fight to to talk about vulnerabilities. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So, while this while this um loads, I So, while this while this um loads, I So, while this while this um loads, I got a question about those um CVS that got a question about those um CVS that got a question about those um CVS that you mentioned that only had like a you mentioned that only had like a you mentioned that only had like a character descript character descript character descript description. What do you think should description. What do you think should description. What do you think should should we do about those uh things should we do about those uh things should we do about those uh things because like we don't have much to start because like we don't have much to start because like we don't have much to start off like say if the description of the off like say if the description of the off like say if the description of the CV is an A. Yeah. What should we do on CV is an A. Yeah. What should we do on CV is an A. Yeah. What should we do on these? Do you feel that we should reject these? Do you feel that we should reject these? Do you feel that we should reject them or should we push back and say you them or should we push back and say you them or should we push back and say you either behave and put out good data or either behave and put out good data or either behave and put out good data or there can be consequences here? I don't there can be consequences here? I don't there can be consequences here? I don't know. And to be completely honest that know. And to be completely honest that know. And to be completely honest that the one character one is kind of a is the one character one is kind of a is the one character one is kind of a is kind of an outlier. Let's talk about a kind of an outlier. Let's talk about a kind of an outlier. Let's talk about a real situation. Um Microsoft releases real situation. Um Microsoft releases real situation. Um Microsoft releases fourword CVEes all the time. You know fourword CVEes all the time. You know fourword CVEes all the time. You know buffer overrun in Windows kernel, right? buffer overrun in Windows kernel, right? buffer overrun in Windows kernel, right? Is that good enough for for most people? Is that good enough for for most people? Is that good enough for for most people? It doesn't say what windows. It doesn't It doesn't say what windows. It doesn't It doesn't say what windows. It doesn't say anything, right? Like like three and say anything, right? Like like three and say anything, right? Like like three and four CVE descriptions are not four CVE descriptions are not four CVE descriptions are not uncommon. So I wonder why they simply uncommon. So I wonder why they simply uncommon. So I wonder why they simply just don't pump that into their own just don't pump that into their own just don't pump that into their own choice of LLM and just say give me a choice of LLM and just say give me a choice of LLM and just say give me a good thing about Yeah, I don't know. I good thing about Yeah, I don't know. I good thing about Yeah, I don't know. I don't know if it's if a lot of people don't know if it's if a lot of people don't know if it's if a lot of people think that the more data you put in the think that the more data you put in the think that the more data you put in the CVE, the more likely it is to be to be CVE, the more likely it is to be to be CVE, the more likely it is to be to be exploited. I I don't know if that's true exploited. I I don't know if that's true exploited. I I don't know if that's true or not. Right. So, we're back to or not. Right. So, we're back to or not. Right. So, we're back to security by obscurity. If if it doesn't security by obscurity. If if it doesn't security by obscurity. If if it doesn't say that it has to be a verbose say that it has to be a verbose say that it has to be a verbose description, a lot of people are not description, a lot of people are not description, a lot of people are not going to do that. And I once again ran going to do that. And I once again ran going to do that. And I once again ran into this. Um I'm happy to come help you into this. Um I'm happy to come help you into this. Um I'm happy to come help you at your desk, but just reloading this at your desk, but just reloading this at your desk, but just reloading this notebook up here isn't going to be fun notebook up here isn't going to be fun notebook up here isn't going to be fun for for anybody. I'm super sorry about for for anybody. I'm super sorry about for for anybody. I'm super sorry about that. I did try. This notebook is that. I did try. This notebook is that. I did try. This notebook is available on GitHub and I will update it available on GitHub and I will update it available on GitHub and I will update it and I will stick around and answer any and I will stick around and answer any and I will stick around and answer any questions. Um, I'm sorry about that. questions. Um, I'm sorry about that. questions. Um, I'm sorry about that. I'll show you what we were going to I'll show you what we were going to I'll show you what we were going to build. So, here's what I build on build. So, here's what I build on build. So, here's what I build on cve.icu every day. It's these graphs with these day. It's these graphs with these day. It's these graphs with these calendars and it just shows you how many calendars and it just shows you how many calendars and it just shows you how many CVEes are published every day, what the CVEes are published every day, what the CVEes are published every day, what the CVE per month are. Um, who's the CNA CVE per month are. Um, who's the CNA CVE per month are. Um, who's the CNA assigner. This is really interesting. Uh assigner. This is really interesting. Uh assigner. This is really interesting. Uh for the first time in the history of for the first time in the history of for the first time in the history of MITER, uh patchstack.com is MITER, uh patchstack.com is MITER, uh patchstack.com is outpublishing MITER as a CNA. So we outpublishing MITER as a CNA. So we outpublishing MITER as a CNA. So we finally have have someone who is finally have have someone who is finally have have someone who is publishing more CVEEs than than the publishing more CVEEs than than the publishing more CVEEs than than the root. Uh we I think that last time I root. Uh we I think that last time I root. Uh we I think that last time I looked kernel.org was right behind it. looked kernel.org was right behind it. looked kernel.org was right behind it. They had a big a big dump lately. So So They had a big a big dump lately. So So They had a big a big dump lately. So So for the first time this year, I'm pretty for the first time this year, I'm pretty for the first time this year, I'm pretty confident that that MITER will move into confident that that MITER will move into confident that that MITER will move into the the parts that they've always wanted the the parts that they've always wanted the the parts that they've always wanted to be. just the program manager and not to be. just the program manager and not to be. just the program manager and not the CNA of first. I really like your graphs because I see I really like your graphs because I see I really like your graphs because I see I use them all the time. But I think I use them all the time. But I think I use them all the time. But I think it's also telling if you look patch it's also telling if you look patch it's also telling if you look patch stack and the third one which is Word stack and the third one which is Word stack and the third one which is Word Fence I believe they're all coming from Fence I believe they're all coming from Fence I believe they're all coming from more or less the same thing. It's more or less the same thing. It's more or less the same thing. It's WordPress plugins and metric ton of CVS WordPress plugins and metric ton of CVS WordPress plugins and metric ton of CVS that they're coming with. Yeah. And and that they're coming with. Yeah. And and that they're coming with. Yeah. And and personal opinion I I'm okay with that, personal opinion I I'm okay with that, personal opinion I I'm okay with that, right? Like as long as the records are right? Like as long as the records are right? Like as long as the records are full, I I am not upset about it. Like we full, I I am not upset about it. Like we full, I I am not upset about it. Like we work with a relatively small data set. work with a relatively small data set. work with a relatively small data set. When you talk to other people who work When you talk to other people who work When you talk to other people who work with security data sets, 250,000 records with security data sets, 250,000 records with security data sets, 250,000 records is small. I mean or at Cisco, we have is small. I mean or at Cisco, we have is small. I mean or at Cisco, we have firewalls that produce that many CIS firewalls that produce that many CIS firewalls that produce that many CIS logs in an, you know, in a minute. So logs in an, you know, in a minute. So logs in an, you know, in a minute. So like I'm okay with with that data being like I'm okay with with that data being like I'm okay with with that data being in there if it's valid. And I think the in there if it's valid. And I think the in there if it's valid. And I think the community does a very good job of community does a very good job of community does a very good job of calling out people when they are are calling out people when they are are calling out people when they are are stuffing CVEes are are producing CVEs stuffing CVEes are are producing CVEs stuffing CVEes are are producing CVEs that are not of quality. But that there that are not of quality. But that there that are not of quality. But that there has to be a better intake policy for has to be a better intake policy for has to be a better intake policy for that. Yeah. Yeah. I I kind of commend that. Yeah. Yeah. I I kind of commend that. Yeah. Yeah. I I kind of commend Patch Stack on their strategies to Patch Stack on their strategies to Patch Stack on their strategies to basically they saw a gap in the market basically they saw a gap in the market basically they saw a gap in the market and they positioned themselves like oh and they positioned themselves like oh and they positioned themselves like oh yeah WordPress plugins like there's yeah WordPress plugins like there's yeah WordPress plugins like there's thousands getting spun up every week. thousands getting spun up every week. thousands getting spun up every week. So, but there's not they're quite So, but there's not they're quite So, but there's not they're quite vulnerable per nature because you just vulnerable per nature because you just vulnerable per nature because you just can crank out one. So, y it's really can crank out one. So, y it's really can crank out one. So, y it's really nice that they just got that market nice that they just got that market nice that they just got that market niche and just fully own and they know, niche and just fully own and they know, niche and just fully own and they know, right? Like if it doesn't have a CVE, right? Like if it doesn't have a CVE, right? Like if it doesn't have a CVE, it's not going to get prioritized by it's not going to get prioritized by it's not going to get prioritized by vulnerability management team. So, even vulnerability management team. So, even vulnerability management team. So, even though it is just a cross- sight though it is just a cross- sight though it is just a cross- sight scripting and a and a WordPress plugin, scripting and a and a WordPress plugin, scripting and a and a WordPress plugin, if they give it a CVE, it will land on if they give it a CVE, it will land on if they give it a CVE, it will land on somebody's road map versus not having a somebody's road map versus not having a somebody's road map versus not having a CVE. So, they're using the CVE program CVE. So, they're using the CVE program CVE. So, they're using the CVE program correctly. I I have no I have no qualms correctly. I I have no I have no qualms correctly. I I have no I have no qualms with the way that that they're doing the with the way that that they're doing the with the way that that they're doing the data. I don't think that them or data. I don't think that them or data. I don't think that them or kernel.org are trying to abuse the CBE kernel.org are trying to abuse the CBE kernel.org are trying to abuse the CBE system in any way. I I just think it's system in any way. I I just think it's system in any way. I I just think it's the lack of guard rails that that the lack of guard rails that that the lack of guard rails that that sometimes produce less than ideal CBE sometimes produce less than ideal CBE sometimes produce less than ideal CBE descriptions. descriptions. descriptions. Does anybody have any other questions or Does anybody have any other questions or Does anybody have any other questions or that I can help that I can help that I can help with?

Uh, you can run Jupyter books. I will say that can run Jupyter books. I will say that can run Jupyter books. I will say that once you figure out what you want in once you figure out what you want in once you figure out what you want in your notebook, especially if you're at a your notebook, especially if you're at a your notebook, especially if you're at a CNA and just want to say, "Hey, what do CNA and just want to say, "Hey, what do CNA and just want to say, "Hey, what do our CVES look like?" It's super simple our CVES look like?" It's super simple our CVES look like?" It's super simple to run this and then use the GitHub to run this and then use the GitHub to run this and then use the GitHub actions to create a CSV or a website. actions to create a CSV or a website. actions to create a CSV or a website.

So we had a question in the back. So we had a question in the back. So we had a question in the back. Hi Jerry, very nice to see you again. Uh Hi Jerry, very nice to see you again. Uh Hi Jerry, very nice to see you again. Uh I I see for the first time that there is I I see for the first time that there is I I see for the first time that there is a affected products in the prediction of a affected products in the prediction of a affected products in the prediction of this model. Are you using the this model. Are you using the this model. Are you using the combination of the CV uh to display the combination of the CV uh to display the combination of the CV uh to display the data or they are just numbers like this data or they are just numbers like this data or they are just numbers like this CV affects this number of data or you CV affects this number of data or you CV affects this number of data or you are also rotating per type of product are also rotating per type of product are also rotating per type of product like this product is generating this like this product is generating this like this product is generating this kind of CV. Sorry on the CPE page. Yeah, kind of CV. Sorry on the CPE page. Yeah, kind of CV. Sorry on the CPE page. Yeah, I see that you're importing in the CV uh I see that you're importing in the CV uh I see that you're importing in the CV uh schema that you were presenting before schema that you were presenting before schema that you were presenting before that the affectation basically uh what that the affectation basically uh what that the affectation basically uh what are the product that are affected HC CB are the product that are affected HC CB are the product that are affected HC CB HCV effects. Are you using this HCV effects. Are you using this HCV effects. Are you using this information in displaying the data or information in displaying the data or information in displaying the data or it's just a number? Just displaying the it's just a number? Just displaying the it's just a number? Just displaying the data at this point. I use that data data at this point. I use that data data at this point. I use that data internally and I think there are a bunch internally and I think there are a bunch internally and I think there are a bunch of good talks going on and and I really of good talks going on and and I really of good talks going on and and I really think that that like the source of truth think that that like the source of truth think that that like the source of truth we really have to kind of browbe people we really have to kind of browbe people we really have to kind of browbe people into using something. into using something. into using something. Um CPEs are have their weaknesses, Pearl Um CPEs are have their weaknesses, Pearl Um CPEs are have their weaknesses, Pearl has their weaknesses, right? But we but has their weaknesses, right? But we but has their weaknesses, right? But we but we can't have our three different we can't have our three different we can't have our three different uh different formats, right, and say uh different formats, right, and say uh different formats, right, and say just pick the one you want and use it just pick the one you want and use it just pick the one you want and use it because it leaves half the people out because it leaves half the people out because it leaves half the people out who built who built who built CPE CPE fun uh tools or pearl tools or CPE CPE fun uh tools or pearl tools or CPE CPE fun uh tools or pearl tools or whatever like there maybe there's a way whatever like there maybe there's a way whatever like there maybe there's a way that that you can just put in when you that that you can just put in when you that that you can just put in when you submit a record you submit a pearl and submit a record you submit a pearl and submit a record you submit a pearl and then there's a best option of a tool then there's a best option of a tool then there's a best option of a tool that then converts it to CP. P or that then converts it to CP. P or that then converts it to CP. P or whatever. I can't remember what the whatever. I can't remember what the whatever. I can't remember what the third version somebody has recently third version somebody has recently third version somebody has recently suggested we use is but yeah it wasn't No, it wasn't Squid. It was it wasn't No, it wasn't Squid. It was it wasn't No, it wasn't Squid. It was another Omnivore. Yeah. Yeah. So yeah, I another Omnivore. Yeah. Yeah. So yeah, I another Omnivore. Yeah. Yeah. So yeah, I I've never used Omnivore. I'm sure for a I've never used Omnivore. I'm sure for a I've never used Omnivore. I'm sure for a various group of people that it's super various group of people that it's super various group of people that it's super important, but Yeah. So So there just important, but Yeah. So So there just important, but Yeah. So So there just has to be some way to convert that data has to be some way to convert that data has to be some way to convert that data back and forth for for everybody to use back and forth for for everybody to use back and forth for for everybody to use it. talking a lot. But I guess this also talking a lot. But I guess this also talking a lot. But I guess this also goes to show that we didn't learn goes to show that we didn't learn goes to show that we didn't learn anything from beta versus VHS or HDVD anything from beta versus VHS or HDVD anything from beta versus VHS or HDVD versus Blu-ray because we keep doing the versus Blu-ray because we keep doing the versus Blu-ray because we keep doing the thing where we have competing formats thing where we have competing formats thing where we have competing formats and we don't coalesce into one or create and we don't coalesce into one or create and we don't coalesce into one or create tooling to transfer one to the other. We tooling to transfer one to the other. We tooling to transfer one to the other. We also see this in the SBOM space with also see this in the SBOM space with also see this in the SBOM space with SPDS and others. Yeah. Yeah, I mean I I SPDS and others. Yeah. Yeah, I mean I I SPDS and others. Yeah. Yeah, I mean I I think it's because and to be completely think it's because and to be completely think it's because and to be completely honest, I think CPE is an abandoned uh honest, I think CPE is an abandoned uh honest, I think CPE is an abandoned uh format. Nobody knows who owns it or who format. Nobody knows who owns it or who format. Nobody knows who owns it or who Ricks I don't even think the CPE board Ricks I don't even think the CPE board Ricks I don't even think the CPE board meets to discuss changes to the schema meets to discuss changes to the schema meets to discuss changes to the schema anymore. And then you end up with stuff anymore. And then you end up with stuff anymore. And then you end up with stuff like this, right? Like I this is always like this, right? Like I this is always like this, right? Like I this is always funny there. These are the CVEes with funny there. These are the CVEes with funny there. These are the CVEes with the highest CPE counts, unique CPE the highest CPE counts, unique CPE the highest CPE counts, unique CPE counts. There's one CPE that has counts. There's one CPE that has counts. There's one CPE that has 4,800 affected products on it, right? 4,800 affected products on it, right? 4,800 affected products on it, right? And we're on this list, too. Cisco, I And we're on this list, too. Cisco, I And we're on this list, too. Cisco, I think, is third or fourth here. We have think, is third or fourth here. We have think, is third or fourth here. We have one with 2400. It's probably used, one with 2400. It's probably used, one with 2400. It's probably used, right? But is that useful to to most right? But is that useful to to most right? But is that useful to to most people? When you go look at the NVD page people? When you go look at the NVD page people? When you go look at the NVD page for that, it's like scrolls after for that, it's like scrolls after for that, it's like scrolls after scrolls, right? Like, we really need to scrolls, right? Like, we really need to scrolls, right? Like, we really need to get serious about data quality and and get serious about data quality and and get serious about data quality and and to lean into it. And I'm not even here to lean into it. And I'm not even here to lean into it. And I'm not even here to say that AI is the way to do that in to say that AI is the way to do that in to say that AI is the way to do that in machine learning. I would be happy if we machine learning. I would be happy if we machine learning. I would be happy if we just did some simple rejects or just did some simple rejects or just did some simple rejects or anything, right? Like I I know that the anything, right? Like I I know that the anything, right? Like I I know that the cool thing to say is AI can solve this cool thing to say is AI can solve this cool thing to say is AI can solve this problem. I I don't know if it can, but I problem. I I don't know if it can, but I problem. I I don't know if it can, but I know that we can do a better job than know that we can do a better job than know that we can do a better job than what we're we're doing now when we allow what we're we're doing now when we allow what we're we're doing now when we allow CVES to be published with minimal data. Awesome. Thank you guys very much. Once Awesome. Thank you guys very much. Once Awesome. Thank you guys very much. Once again, I apologize that the demo didn't again, I apologize that the demo didn't again, I apologize that the demo didn't work as planned, but I am super happy to work as planned, but I am super happy to work as planned, but I am super happy to to spend time for the next however long to spend time for the next however long to spend time for the next however long and answer any questions you have or to and answer any questions you have or to and answer any questions you have or to help you work with stuff. So, thank you help you work with stuff. So, thank you help you work with stuff. So, thank you guys again and and have a good day and guys again and and have a good day and guys again and and have a good day and and the rest of the conference.
