My title is I am SIS lead CVE numbering My title is I am SIS lead CVE numbering My title is I am SIS lead CVE numbering authority recruiter and then my title is authority recruiter and then my title is authority recruiter and then my title is strategic partnerships in vulnerability strategic partnerships in vulnerability strategic partnerships in vulnerability program development and we're going to program development and we're going to program development and we're going to dive into what our roles mean and just dive into what our roles mean and just dive into what our roles mean and just give you guys a little bit of background give you guys a little bit of background give you guys a little bit of background on who we are and why we're on who we are and why we're on who we are and why we're here. So as SIS's lead CVE and numbering here. So as SIS's lead CVE and numbering here. So as SIS's lead CVE and numbering authority recruiter, I complete outreach authority recruiter, I complete outreach authority recruiter, I complete outreach to companies, researchers, organizations to companies, researchers, organizations to companies, researchers, organizations to join the CVE program as a partner. to join the CVE program as a partner. to join the CVE program as a partner. The ecosystem depends on partners to The ecosystem depends on partners to The ecosystem depends on partners to contribute to the e ecosystem contribute to the e ecosystem contribute to the e ecosystem meaningfully so we can all take meaningfully so we can all take meaningfully so we can all take actionable uh defense. So in my tenure actionable uh defense. So in my tenure actionable uh defense. So in my tenure at CISA which is about two and a half at CISA which is about two and a half at CISA which is about two and a half years I've been uh proud to onboard over years I've been uh proud to onboard over years I've been uh proud to onboard over 40 organizations with my team. Thank 40 organizations with my team. Thank 40 organizations with my team. Thank you. Uh CIS's root scope is industrial you. Uh CIS's root scope is industrial you. Uh CIS's root scope is industrial control systems, medical devices and control systems, medical devices and control systems, medical devices and critical infrastructure. I like to say critical infrastructure. I like to say critical infrastructure. I like to say we look for partners that um if we look for partners that um if we look for partners that um if vulnerabilities are found in those vulnerabilities are found in those vulnerabilities are found in those systems, they could have catastrophic systems, they could have catastrophic systems, they could have catastrophic impacts on uh American lives and public impacts on uh American lives and public impacts on uh American lives and public safety. So here is just an example of me safety. So here is just an example of me safety. So here is just an example of me at Defcon with some of our uh new CVE at Defcon with some of our uh new CVE at Defcon with some of our uh new CVE partners. This is Brawn, a medical partners. This is Brawn, a medical partners. This is Brawn, a medical device partner. And if you maybe haven't device partner. And if you maybe haven't device partner.

Um and you know, I share that with you because the know, I share that with you because the know, I share that with you because the roots have a great working relationship roots have a great working relationship roots have a great working relationship with one another. we all recruit with one another. we all recruit with one another. we all recruit organizations to partner in the CVE organizations to partner in the CVE organizations to partner in the CVE program within our specific scopes. The program within our specific scopes. The program within our specific scopes. The other podcast I'll point out is the other podcast I'll point out is the other podcast I'll point out is the myths versus facts. Um that's where I myths versus facts. Um that's where I myths versus facts. Um that's where I talk about CNA recruitment and answer talk about CNA recruitment and answer talk about CNA recruitment and answer questions you may not be familiar with. questions you may not be familiar with. questions you may not be familiar with. So um what types of organizations can So um what types of organizations can So um what types of organizations can become CNAs like bug bounty programs? become CNAs like bug bounty programs? become CNAs like bug bounty programs? They are totally eligible to be a CNA. They are totally eligible to be a CNA. They are totally eligible to be a CNA. um thirdparty coordinators, researchers, um thirdparty coordinators, researchers, um thirdparty coordinators, researchers, consortiums. You can look at the full consortiums. You can look at the full consortiums. You can look at the full CVE list of partners online at cve.org CVE list of partners online at cve.org CVE list of partners online at cve.org and that gives you an idea of just the and that gives you an idea of just the and that gives you an idea of just the diversity we have within the program. All right, awesome. I'm going program. All right, awesome. I'm going program. All right, awesome. I'm going to talk a little bit about my to talk a little bit about my to talk a little bit about my background. I know I've met a good bunch background. I know I've met a good bunch background. I know I've met a good bunch of you this week and I'm very grateful of you this week and I'm very grateful of you this week and I'm very grateful for that. Um, so I'm going to, um, if for that. Um, so I'm going to, um, if for that. Um, so I'm going to, um, if you see some of these images up here. So you see some of these images up here. So you see some of these images up here. So in my prior role at SIZA, I've been at in my prior role at SIZA, I've been at in my prior role at SIZA, I've been at SIZA for about a couple of years now. I SIZA for about a couple of years now. I SIZA for about a couple of years now. I was in our production shop. So how many was in our production shop. So how many was in our production shop. So how many of you read at any of our joint of you read at any of our joint of you read at any of our joint advisories from SIZA? Bunch of hands up. advisories from SIZA? Bunch of hands up. advisories from SIZA? Bunch of hands up. Amazing. So here's an example of one Amazing. So here's an example of one Amazing. So here's an example of one that I helped write. So we'd hear about that I helped write. So we'd hear about that I helped write. So we'd hear about a CVE, a vulnerability, and it be a CVE, a vulnerability, and it be a CVE, a vulnerability, and it be exploited in the wild uh, by, you know, exploited in the wild uh, by, you know, exploited in the wild uh, by, you know, a nation state actor or the like. and we a nation state actor or the like. and we a nation state actor or the like. and we developed these joint advisories to developed these joint advisories to developed these joint advisories to communicate what was going on. And so I communicate what was going on. And so I communicate what was going on. And so I have a very strong uh communication have a very strong uh communication have a very strong uh communication background and uh would work with a background and uh would work with a background and uh would work with a bunch of our international and inter bunch of our international and inter bunch of our international and inter agency partners to de uh develop this agency partners to de uh develop this agency partners to de uh develop this guidance. Uh additionally uh if you've guidance. Uh additionally uh if you've guidance. Uh additionally uh if you've seen our SPD alerts, anyone read the SPD seen our SPD alerts, anyone read the SPD seen our SPD alerts, anyone read the SPD alerts at all? Bob has. We've got alerts at all? Bob has. We've got alerts at all? Bob has. We've got somebody else in the back. Uh so Bob and somebody else in the back. Uh so Bob and somebody else in the back. Uh so Bob and I actually created this series of I actually created this series of I actually created this series of publications called the secure by design publications called the secure by design publications called the secure by design alerts and essentially they were alerts and essentially they were alerts and essentially they were focusing on eliminating classes of focusing on eliminating classes of focusing on eliminating classes of vulnerabilities. Who likes eliminating vulnerabilities. Who likes eliminating vulnerabilities. Who likes eliminating classes of classes of classes of vulnerabilities? Sweet, sweet, great vulnerabilities? Sweet, sweet, great vulnerabilities? Sweet, sweet, great room. Great room. Um, so we've released room. Great room. Um, so we've released room. Great room. Um, so we've released around eight of them and uh through my around eight of them and uh through my around eight of them and uh through my work developing those with Bob and other work developing those with Bob and other work developing those with Bob and other like folk, Alec from MITER and other like folk, Alec from MITER and other like folk, Alec from MITER and other organizations that were involved and organizations that were involved and organizations that were involved and really cared about eliminating classes really cared about eliminating classes really cared about eliminating classes of vulnerability um they kind of poached of vulnerability um they kind of poached of vulnerability um they kind of poached me over to the vulnerability management me over to the vulnerability management me over to the vulnerability management side of the house and um you know I side of the house and um you know I side of the house and um you know I became in love with that topic with became in love with that topic with became in love with that topic with again uh eliminating classes of again uh eliminating classes of again uh eliminating classes of vulnerability C.WE. and uh I began doing vulnerability C.WE. and uh I began doing vulnerability C.WE. and uh I began doing more speaking engagements on uh these more speaking engagements on uh these more speaking engagements on uh these topics. And that's why I'm here today topics. And that's why I'm here today topics. And that's why I'm here today and why I care. I I care about and why I care. I I care about and why I care. I I care about eliminating these types of things. I eliminating these types of things. I eliminating these types of things. I care about communicating to defenders care about communicating to defenders care about communicating to defenders what's going on uh in a way that allows what's going on uh in a way that allows what's going on uh in a way that allows them to take informed action. And so them to take informed action. And so them to take informed action. And so that's a little bit about us. So Julia's that's a little bit about us. So Julia's that's a little bit about us. So Julia's going to dive into more of uh SIZA and going to dive into more of uh SIZA and going to dive into more of uh SIZA and um and the CV program and how those um and the CV program and how those um and the CV program and how those Whoops. There you go. Spoiler alert. Whoops. There you go. Spoiler alert. Whoops. There you go. Spoiler alert. So at CISO we are America's cyber So at CISO we are America's cyber So at CISO we are America's cyber defense agency. We are also the national defense agency. We are also the national defense agency. We are also the national coordinator for critical infrastructure coordinator for critical infrastructure coordinator for critical infrastructure resilience and we've reduced risk to our resilience and we've reduced risk to our resilience and we've reduced risk to our critical infrastructure. Uh it's kind of critical infrastructure. Uh it's kind of critical infrastructure. Uh it's kind of a big undertaking if I do say so myself. a big undertaking if I do say so myself. a big undertaking if I do say so myself. Thankfully we have the CVE program whose Thankfully we have the CVE program whose Thankfully we have the CVE program whose mission quite align with that. So the mission quite align with that. So the mission quite align with that. So the mission of the CVE program is to mission of the CVE program is to mission of the CVE program is to identify, define, and catalog publicly identify, define, and catalog publicly identify, define, and catalog publicly disclosed disclosed disclosed vulnerabilities. As we know, CVE is the vulnerabilities. As we know, CVE is the vulnerabilities. As we know, CVE is the language through which we communicate language through which we communicate language through which we communicate vulnerability information across time vulnerability information across time vulnerability information across time zones, across industries, across zones, across industries, across zones, across industries, across countries. CVE provides a framework to countries. CVE provides a framework to countries. CVE provides a framework to share critical and actionable share critical and actionable share critical and actionable vulnerability information with cyber vulnerability information with cyber vulnerability information with cyber defenders. I personally care about CVE defenders. I personally care about CVE defenders. I personally care about CVE because you can't have vendor tools. You because you can't have vendor tools. You because you can't have vendor tools. You can't have the KV. You can't have a lot can't have the KV. You can't have a lot can't have the KV. You can't have a lot of important products without CVEEs and of important products without CVEEs and of important products without CVEEs and you can't have CVES without CNAs. So you can't have CVES without CNAs. So you can't have CVES without CNAs. So that's what I do. Our mission, as I that's what I do. Our mission, as I that's what I do. Our mission, as I said, is to protect the nation's said, is to protect the nation's said, is to protect the nation's critical infrastructure. And CVE plays a critical infrastructure. And CVE plays a critical infrastructure. And CVE plays a huge role in that. All right, you guys got a little that. All right, you guys got a little that. All right, you guys got a little preview of this a minute ago with my hot preview of this a minute ago with my hot preview of this a minute ago with my hot fingers. Um but CVE program as Julia was fingers. Um but CVE program as Julia was fingers. Um but CVE program as Julia was mentioning is really the backbone of mentioning is really the backbone of mentioning is really the backbone of effective vulnerability management. It's effective vulnerability management. It's effective vulnerability management. It's a centralized source of truth and it's a a centralized source of truth and it's a a centralized source of truth and it's a standardized reference point for all standardized reference point for all standardized reference point for all vulnerability information. Right? So it vulnerability information. Right? So it vulnerability information. Right? So it provides that standardized name. Uh and provides that standardized name. Uh and provides that standardized name. Uh and then um you know uh it is enriched with then um you know uh it is enriched with then um you know uh it is enriched with a bunch of information that defenders a bunch of information that defenders a bunch of information that defenders can use. Uh it fuels that vulnerability can use. Uh it fuels that vulnerability can use. Uh it fuels that vulnerability management. uh it provides again as I management. uh it provides again as I management. uh it provides again as I mentioned that actionable information mentioned that actionable information mentioned that actionable information for defenders in that centralized uh for defenders in that centralized uh for defenders in that centralized uh repository. It enables risk reduction as repository. It enables risk reduction as repository. It enables risk reduction as Julia mentioned that's our main mission Julia mentioned that's our main mission Julia mentioned that's our main mission at SIZA. We're reducing the nation's at SIZA. We're reducing the nation's at SIZA. We're reducing the nation's risk specifically um within the FPS and risk specifically um within the FPS and risk specifically um within the FPS and critical infrastructure and it also critical infrastructure and it also critical infrastructure and it also enables global collaboration. It's a enables global collaboration. It's a enables global collaboration. It's a system that can be again used worldwide system that can be again used worldwide system that can be again used worldwide amongst different types of languages. I amongst different types of languages. I amongst different types of languages. I I know we've got some of our I know we've got some of our I know we've got some of our international friends in the back. Um international friends in the back. Um international friends in the back. Um and um again, a tool to be used globally and um again, a tool to be used globally and um again, a tool to be used globally to reduce to reduce to reduce risk. Working together, we're really risk. Working together, we're really risk. Working together, we're really strengthening the backbone of strengthening the backbone of strengthening the backbone of vulnerability management. CISA is the vulnerability management. CISA is the vulnerability management. CISA is the sole sponsor of the CVE program and we sole sponsor of the CVE program and we sole sponsor of the CVE program and we recognize why it's so important to all recognize why it's so important to all recognize why it's so important to all of these other activities that cyber of these other activities that cyber of these other activities that cyber defenders need to take action. As Reena defenders need to take action. As Reena defenders need to take action. As Reena said, together CVE is useful, said, together CVE is useful, said, together CVE is useful, accessible, and a single source of truth accessible, and a single source of truth accessible, and a single source of truth for vulnerability information for for vulnerability information for for vulnerability information for vendors, for researchers, uh to vendors, for researchers, uh to vendors, for researchers, uh to government agencies. And by supporting government agencies. And by supporting government agencies. And by supporting CVE, we're really building the backbone CVE, we're really building the backbone CVE, we're really building the backbone of effective vulnerability management. of effective vulnerability management. of effective vulnerability management. You're quite familiar with uh this CVE You're quite familiar with uh this CVE You're quite familiar with uh this CVE record requirement. If you're not, um record requirement. If you're not, um record requirement. If you're not, um study up. study up. study up. So the three required parts of a CVE So the three required parts of a CVE So the three required parts of a CVE record are the CVE ID, that's the number record are the CVE ID, that's the number record are the CVE ID, that's the number in front, a description, and a reference in front, a description, and a reference in front, a description, and a reference link. Now, a really quality record will link. Now, a really quality record will link. Now, a really quality record will include a comprehensive list of affected include a comprehensive list of affected include a comprehensive list of affected products and their affected versions in products and their affected versions in products and their affected versions in the description. Um, it won't be just NA the description. Um, it won't be just NA the description. Um, it won't be just NA or anything else. We really rely on or anything else. We really rely on or anything else. We really rely on descriptions to give us more information descriptions to give us more information descriptions to give us more information about the vulnerability. Uh my analysts about the vulnerability. Uh my analysts about the vulnerability. Uh my analysts tell me that in particular patch if a tell me that in particular patch if a tell me that in particular patch if a patch is available please include that patch is available please include that patch is available please include that in the description and if there's a in the description and if there's a in the description and if there's a workaround guidance that is also workaround guidance that is also workaround guidance that is also arguably their most uh desired part of arguably their most uh desired part of arguably their most uh desired part of the the the description. Um these required fields description. Um these required fields description. Um these required fields give the basis for the record giving give the basis for the record giving give the basis for the record giving cyber defenders the initial info to cyber defenders the initial info to cyber defenders the initial info to start triaging vulnerabilities in their start triaging vulnerabilities in their start triaging vulnerabilities in their own own own systems. For references uh just one link systems. For references uh just one link systems. For references uh just one link is required but what's really great is is required but what's really great is is required but what's really great is when you can compile uh links from the when you can compile uh links from the when you can compile uh links from the researcher this the authoring CNA and researcher this the authoring CNA and researcher this the authoring CNA and maybe you know some GitHub about the maybe you know some GitHub about the maybe you know some GitHub about the proof of concept for the vulnerability. proof of concept for the vulnerability. proof of concept for the vulnerability. That all makes a really quality CVE That all makes a really quality CVE That all makes a really quality CVE record. record. record. But then I also want to talk about But then I also want to talk about But then I also want to talk about enriched records. So when we glow up enriched records. So when we glow up enriched records. So when we glow up CVEes, we add a little CWE and a CVEes, we add a little CWE and a CVEes, we add a little CWE and a CVSS. And right here I have some stats. CVSS. And right here I have some stats. CVSS. And right here I have some stats. So um you know in uh the past year 284 So um you know in uh the past year 284 So um you know in uh the past year 284 CNAs produced 23,000 CVE records. Uh CNAs produced 23,000 CVE records. Uh CNAs produced 23,000 CVE records. Uh close to 12,000 of those records had close to 12,000 of those records had close to 12,000 of those records had both CWE and CVSS. So that's really both CWE and CVSS. So that's really both CWE and CVSS. So that's really really great. Um 71% of the CVEEs had really great. Um 71% of the CVEEs had really great. Um 71% of the CVEEs had just C.WE and 53% had um just C.WE and 53% had um just C.WE and 53% had um CVSS. And so like mentioned this CVSS. And so like mentioned this CVSS. And so like mentioned this morning's talk with Sandy and Bob when morning's talk with Sandy and Bob when morning's talk with Sandy and Bob when we talk about completeness right now we talk about completeness right now we talk about completeness right now we're focusing on CWE and we're focusing on CWE and we're focusing on CWE and CVSS. They are a vital part to providing CVSS. They are a vital part to providing CVSS. They are a vital part to providing context of a vulnerability. C.WE helps context of a vulnerability. C.WE helps context of a vulnerability. C.WE helps us understand the underlying weakness of us understand the underlying weakness of us understand the underlying weakness of a vulnerability and CVSS is the a vulnerability and CVSS is the a vulnerability and CVSS is the standardized scoring system for standardized scoring system for standardized scoring system for assessing potential technical impact and assessing potential technical impact and assessing potential technical impact and severity. So we believe that adding CWE severity. So we believe that adding CWE severity. So we believe that adding CWE and CVSS significantly enhances the and CVSS significantly enhances the and CVSS significantly enhances the values of CVE entries and helps values of CVE entries and helps values of CVE entries and helps defenders prioritize and act defenders prioritize and act defenders prioritize and act effectively. Um, as you can see, not all effectively. Um, as you can see, not all effectively. Um, as you can see, not all CVEEs include these, and we really want CVEEs include these, and we really want CVEEs include these, and we really want to minimize that gap. And that brings us to minimize that gap. And that brings us to minimize that gap. And that brings us to the reason we are here to the reason we are here to the reason we are here today. CVE records need a today. CVE records need a today. CVE records need a glowup. Does anyone in the audience know glowup. Does anyone in the audience know glowup. Does anyone in the audience know what a glow-up what a glow-up what a glow-up is? All right. There's a lot who don't is? All right. There's a lot who don't is? All right. There's a lot who don't know. know. know. Thank god we're here to describe it. Thank god we're here to describe it. Thank god we're here to describe it. Thank god we're here. Thank god we're here. Thank god we're here. uh glow-up is not just a makeover. It is uh glow-up is not just a makeover. It is uh glow-up is not just a makeover. It is a physical, it's not only a physical a physical, it's not only a physical a physical, it's not only a physical transformation. It's really building on transformation. It's really building on transformation. It's really building on the foundation of something and the foundation of something and the foundation of something and improving it to be more effective. Uh so improving it to be more effective. Uh so improving it to be more effective. Uh so like any great transformation, we're like any great transformation, we're like any great transformation, we're improving on the essentials, making it improving on the essentials, making it improving on the essentials, making it stronger, reliable, and more equipped stronger, reliable, and more equipped stronger, reliable, and more equipped for the challenges ahead. And Glow is for the challenges ahead. And Glow is for the challenges ahead. And Glow is not just for beauty blogs. We think not just for beauty blogs. We think not just for beauty blogs. We think Glow-Ups are definitely applicable to Glow-Ups are definitely applicable to Glow-Ups are definitely applicable to Cvees. So, right here we have the iconic Cvees. So, right here we have the iconic Cvees. So, right here we have the iconic 2001 film, The Princess 2001 film, The Princess 2001 film, The Princess Diaries. Okay, people are laughing. That Diaries. Okay, people are laughing. That Diaries. Okay, people are laughing. That means they've seen it. This is a common means they've seen it. This is a common means they've seen it. This is a common uh um picture when you're talking about uh um picture when you're talking about uh um picture when you're talking about a glow up, right? It's a physical one. a glow up, right? It's a physical one. a glow up, right? It's a physical one. Mia is a clumsy high schooler, very Mia is a clumsy high schooler, very Mia is a clumsy high schooler, very afraid of public speaking, kind of afraid of public speaking, kind of afraid of public speaking, kind of relatable. Um and uh she finds out that relatable. Um and uh she finds out that relatable. Um and uh she finds out that she is the heir to the throne of the she is the heir to the throne of the she is the heir to the throne of the princess of Govia. And so during her princess of Govia. And so during her princess of Govia. And so during her princess training, she learns how to be princess training, she learns how to be princess training, she learns how to be graceful and empowered to hopefully graceful and empowered to hopefully graceful and empowered to hopefully govern eventually. So in addition to the govern eventually. So in addition to the govern eventually. So in addition to the physical makeover, she had um a physical makeover, she had um a physical makeover, she had um a transformation. And then we also have transformation. And then we also have transformation. And then we also have Captain Captain Captain America. Hopefully that lands with this America. Hopefully that lands with this America. Hopefully that lands with this crowd. So Steve Rogers uh origin story. crowd. So Steve Rogers uh origin story. crowd. So Steve Rogers uh origin story. uh not quite the physical fitness or uh not quite the physical fitness or uh not quite the physical fitness or size that they were looking for in the size that they were looking for in the size that they were looking for in the US military, but uh he was very US military, but uh he was very US military, but uh he was very courageous with a big heart. And so he courageous with a big heart. And so he courageous with a big heart. And so he uh he volunteered to be enriched uh he volunteered to be enriched uh he volunteered to be enriched injected with the super soldier syrup uh injected with the super soldier syrup uh injected with the super soldier syrup uh which gave him power, strength, and which gave him power, strength, and which gave him power, strength, and durability. Um so when I think of durability. Um so when I think of durability. Um so when I think of glow-up, this is what I originally glow-up, this is what I originally glow-up, this is what I originally thought of, but you know, we'll go on thought of, but you know, we'll go on thought of, but you know, we'll go on and share how it's more applicable to and share how it's more applicable to and share how it's more applicable to CVS and whatnot. who uh let's see on the top we have the who uh let's see on the top we have the who uh let's see on the top we have the old cve.mmeriter.org old cve.mmeriter.org old cve.mmeriter.org um this was the first website and you um this was the first website and you um this was the first website and you know we upgraded we had a glow up in know we upgraded we had a glow up in know we upgraded we had a glow up in 2021 the website updated to just cve.org 2021 the website updated to just cve.org 2021 the website updated to just cve.org or and it's uh more userfriendly and or and it's uh more userfriendly and or and it's uh more userfriendly and even in 2023 we were able to bulk even in 2023 we were able to bulk even in 2023 we were able to bulk download the JSON files for CVEEs which download the JSON files for CVEEs which download the JSON files for CVEEs which was a significant improvement to how you was a significant improvement to how you was a significant improvement to how you were ingesting CVE records before. So were ingesting CVE records before. So were ingesting CVE records before. So the CVE program has already gone through the CVE program has already gone through the CVE program has already gone through a little glow up itself and then Windows a little glow up itself and then Windows a little glow up itself and then Windows 95. Who used Windows 95 in their first 95. Who used Windows 95 in their first 95. Who used Windows 95 in their first job? Love it. Now, my argument here, my argument here is you couldn't here, my argument here is you couldn't here, my argument here is you couldn't have Windows 11 without Windows 95. So, have Windows 11 without Windows 95. So, have Windows 11 without Windows 95. So, Windows 95, uh, you know, was actually Windows 95, uh, you know, was actually Windows 95, uh, you know, was actually kind of revolutionary with the little kind of revolutionary with the little kind of revolutionary with the little taskbar, the start button, things like taskbar, the start button, things like taskbar, the start button, things like that, a gooey interface. Um, and the that, a gooey interface. Um, and the that, a gooey interface. Um, and the Windows 11 that we likely all use in our Windows 11 that we likely all use in our Windows 11 that we likely all use in our day-to-day settings really depended on day-to-day settings really depended on day-to-day settings really depended on that glow up, that improvement. We would that glow up, that improvement. We would that glow up, that improvement. We would not be here without Windows 95. All right, this last analogy is 95. All right, this last analogy is 95. All right, this last analogy is going to get us a bit closer to TVE going to get us a bit closer to TVE going to get us a bit closer to TVE records, I promise. Anyone a Star Wars records, I promise. Anyone a Star Wars records, I promise. Anyone a Star Wars fan in here? fan in here? fan in here? No more than that. Yeah, I think there's No more than that. Yeah, I think there's No more than that. Yeah, I think there's more. There's got to be more. All right. more. There's got to be more. All right. more. There's got to be more. All right. All right. I'm raising my hand, too. Um, All right. I'm raising my hand, too. Um, All right. I'm raising my hand, too. Um, so right here we have Luke Skywalker in so right here we have Luke Skywalker in so right here we have Luke Skywalker in A New Hope. So Luke Skywalker, he's just A New Hope. So Luke Skywalker, he's just A New Hope. So Luke Skywalker, he's just kind of, you know, simple. doesn't kind of, you know, simple. doesn't kind of, you know, simple. doesn't really know that he has the force. He's really know that he has the force. He's really know that he has the force. He's growing up on a farm and um and then he growing up on a farm and um and then he growing up on a farm and um and then he meets Obi-Wan and then he meets Yoda and meets Obi-Wan and then he meets Yoda and meets Obi-Wan and then he meets Yoda and they teach him about the force. They they teach him about the force. They they teach him about the force. They teach him about all the mitochlorans he teach him about all the mitochlorans he teach him about all the mitochlorans he has within his body that he could use to has within his body that he could use to has within his body that he could use to harness and and again harness the force. harness and and again harness the force. harness and and again harness the force. Uh they teach him the Jedi ways, the Uh they teach him the Jedi ways, the Uh they teach him the Jedi ways, the lessons that they've garnered over years lessons that they've garnered over years lessons that they've garnered over years and years and years. In Yoda's case, and years and years. In Yoda's case, and years and years. In Yoda's case, like hundreds and hundreds of years. the like hundreds and hundreds of years. the like hundreds and hundreds of years. the species lives like close to a thousand species lives like close to a thousand species lives like close to a thousand I'm pretty sure. Um anywh who uh as he I'm pretty sure. Um anywh who uh as he I'm pretty sure. Um anywh who uh as he learns and as he teaches and as he gets learns and as he teaches and as he gets learns and as he teaches and as he gets tools tools tools uh he becomes a powerful and skilled uh he becomes a powerful and skilled uh he becomes a powerful and skilled Jedi that's prepared to take on the Jedi that's prepared to take on the Jedi that's prepared to take on the Galactic Empire. Actually, I think I Galactic Empire. Actually, I think I Galactic Empire. Actually, I think I have one of those tools with me today. have one of those tools with me today. have one of those tools with me today. Julia, if you will. Yeah, I think we Julia, if you will. Yeah, I think we Julia, if you will. Yeah, I think we packed them. Thank you. So Luke Luke Skywalker now has an Luke Luke Skywalker now has an Luke Luke Skywalker now has an understanding of the Force. He has an understanding of the Force. He has an understanding of the Force. He has an understanding of his lightsaber, his understanding of his lightsaber, his understanding of his lightsaber, his tool, and he ends up defeating his own tool, and he ends up defeating his own tool, and he ends up defeating his own father, Darth Vader. It's a little bit father, Darth Vader. It's a little bit father, Darth Vader. It's a little bit like, spoiler, sorry. If you haven't like, spoiler, sorry. If you haven't like, spoiler, sorry. If you haven't seen A New Hope, well, watch it. seen A New Hope, well, watch it. seen A New Hope, well, watch it. I know. TLP Star Wars. TLP Star Wars. I know. TLP Star Wars. TLP Star Wars. I know. TLP Star Wars. TLP Star Wars. TLP spoiler. I don't know. TLP spoiler. TLP spoiler. I don't know. TLP spoiler. TLP spoiler. I don't know. TLP spoiler. So Luke before he meets Yoda and before So Luke before he meets Yoda and before So Luke before he meets Yoda and before he meets Obi-Wan and before he has his he meets Obi-Wan and before he has his he meets Obi-Wan and before he has his nice lightsaber, he's kind of like a nice lightsaber, he's kind of like a nice lightsaber, he's kind of like a basic CVE record, right? Competent, basic CVE record, right? Competent, basic CVE record, right? Competent, sure. You know, you've got the sure. You know, you've got the sure. You know, you've got the description there, you've got some description there, you've got some description there, you've got some references, affected product, sure, but references, affected product, sure, but references, affected product, sure, but like not really ready to take on the like not really ready to take on the like not really ready to take on the Empire. And but through that training, Empire. And but through that training, Empire. And but through that training, through that enrichment again, he through that enrichment again, he through that enrichment again, he defeats Darth Vader. So same thing with defeats Darth Vader. So same thing with defeats Darth Vader. So same thing with the CVE record. a CVE record enriched the CVE record. a CVE record enriched the CVE record. a CVE record enriched with the context the CWE or the force with the context the CWE or the force with the context the CWE or the force within the vulnerability and then within the vulnerability and then within the vulnerability and then additionally enriched with the CVSS additionally enriched with the CVSS additionally enriched with the CVSS which is the potential uh technical or which is the potential uh technical or which is the potential uh technical or um technical impact or the potential um technical impact or the potential um technical impact or the potential severity of a vulnerability. Um so akin severity of a vulnerability. Um so akin severity of a vulnerability. Um so akin to Star Wars it would be like how the to Star Wars it would be like how the to Star Wars it would be like how the Death Stars laser would potentially Death Stars laser would potentially Death Stars laser would potentially impact your ship's ability to jump into impact your ship's ability to jump into impact your ship's ability to jump into light speed. uh it's enriched and it light speed. uh it's enriched and it light speed. uh it's enriched and it allows a defender to take action on allows a defender to take action on allows a defender to take action on their systems in an actionable way. their systems in an actionable way. their systems in an actionable way. Again, same thing as Luke Skywalker. Again, same thing as Luke Skywalker. Again, same thing as Luke Skywalker. Without his tools, without that Without his tools, without that Without his tools, without that additional context, without that additional context, without that additional context, without that training, that understanding of the training, that understanding of the training, that understanding of the Force, understanding that Darth Vader is Force, understanding that Darth Vader is Force, understanding that Darth Vader is his father, he might not have been up to his father, he might not have been up to his father, he might not have been up to the task. And so, this is what brings us the task. And so, this is what brings us the task. And so, this is what brings us here today. Excellent handling of the mic, Excellent handling of the mic, Excellent handling of the mic, lightsaber, and the click arena. Thank lightsaber, and the click arena. Thank lightsaber, and the click arena. Thank you so much. you so much. you so much. All right. So, the going back to CVE All right. So, the going back to CVE All right. So, the going back to CVE records, the glow up you didn't think records, the glow up you didn't think records, the glow up you didn't think you needed. Uh, right here we have the you needed. Uh, right here we have the you needed. Uh, right here we have the basic CVE record, which again includes basic CVE record, which again includes basic CVE record, which again includes the required CVE ID, the description, the required CVE ID, the description, the required CVE ID, the description, and uh, at least one reference link. and uh, at least one reference link. and uh, at least one reference link. When we add CWE, we blow it up. We add a When we add CWE, we blow it up. We add a When we add CWE, we blow it up. We add a little enrichment that adds more context little enrichment that adds more context little enrichment that adds more context to the vulnerability giving defenders to the vulnerability giving defenders to the vulnerability giving defenders more uh knowledge and awareness about more uh knowledge and awareness about more uh knowledge and awareness about the vulnerability that they are trying the vulnerability that they are trying the vulnerability that they are trying to um remediate. It also impacts the to um remediate. It also impacts the to um remediate. It also impacts the software development life cycle, right? software development life cycle, right? software development life cycle, right? Addressing vulnerabil reoccurring Addressing vulnerabil reoccurring Addressing vulnerabil reoccurring weaknesses in your products. When we weaknesses in your products. When we weaknesses in your products. When we glow it up with the CVSS string, uh, glow it up with the CVSS string, uh, glow it up with the CVSS string, uh, specifically the vector, that is specifically the vector, that is specifically the vector, that is particularly important to help defenders particularly important to help defenders particularly important to help defenders identify where it is in their systems. identify where it is in their systems. identify where it is in their systems. I've heard that from my analysts I've heard that from my analysts I've heard that from my analysts directly that that part, the first part directly that that part, the first part directly that that part, the first part right there, the vector string, really right there, the vector string, really right there, the vector string, really makes a difference if you include it makes a difference if you include it makes a difference if you include it versus when you versus when you versus when you don't. When we have a fully enriched don't. When we have a fully enriched don't. When we have a fully enriched record, uh, defenders take action. It's record, uh, defenders take action. It's record, uh, defenders take action. It's as simple as that. All right. So, here's an example of a All right. So, here's an example of a All right. So, here's an example of a CVE that does not need a glow up in our CVE that does not need a glow up in our CVE that does not need a glow up in our opinion. Uh, we decided to use one that opinion. Uh, we decided to use one that opinion. Uh, we decided to use one that we published ourselves. Uh, you know, we published ourselves. Uh, you know, we published ourselves. Uh, you know, we're not playing favorites, just, you we're not playing favorites, just, you we're not playing favorites, just, you know, setting an example. Um, this was, know, setting an example. Um, this was, know, setting an example. Um, this was, uh, by the ICSERT CNA. And you can see uh, by the ICSERT CNA. And you can see uh, by the ICSERT CNA. And you can see that in addition to the required info, that in addition to the required info, that in addition to the required info, it has that CVSS score with that it has that CVSS score with that it has that CVSS score with that beautiful vector string. Love it. It's beautiful vector string. Love it. It's beautiful vector string. Love it. It's got its C.WE assignment. It's got a got its C.WE assignment. It's got a got its C.WE assignment. It's got a description which tells you specifically description which tells you specifically description which tells you specifically about the version which is very helpful about the version which is very helpful about the version which is very helpful for cyber defenders. for cyber defenders. for cyber defenders. Um, it also has over here the vendor Um, it also has over here the vendor Um, it also has over here the vendor name, name, name, uh, more versions, product info, uh, more versions, product info, uh, more versions, product info, whatnot. Can anyone guess who maybe whatnot. Can anyone guess who maybe whatnot. Can anyone guess who maybe wrote this wrote this wrote this record? CISA. record? CISA. record? CISA. Right now, who taught who maybe teaches Right now, who taught who maybe teaches Right now, who taught who maybe teaches you how to write good CVE records? Maybe you how to write good CVE records? Maybe you how to write good CVE records? Maybe SISA. Uh, maybe if you grew up with a SISA. Uh, maybe if you grew up with a SISA. Uh, maybe if you grew up with a CVE board member as your CVE board member as your CVE board member as your parent. That's right. Art Manion son parent. That's right. Art Manion son parent. That's right. Art Manion son wrote this CVE record and he did a good job. He record and he did a good job. He record and he did a good job. He probably made him rewrite it a handful probably made him rewrite it a handful probably made him rewrite it a handful of times. Um, so right here, uh, what we'll times. Um, so right here, uh, what we'll times. Um, so right here, uh, what we'll talk about a little bit, uh, later in talk about a little bit, uh, later in talk about a little bit, uh, later in the presentation is about SIS the presentation is about SIS the presentation is about SIS nourishment efforts. how we are glowing nourishment efforts. how we are glowing nourishment efforts. how we are glowing up our own records. But you see here up our own records. But you see here up our own records. But you see here that CISA only provides um the C.WE and that CISA only provides um the C.WE and that CISA only provides um the C.WE and CVSS when it's not included. So uh it's CVSS when it's not included. So uh it's CVSS when it's not included. So uh it's not part of this ADP. But we do provide not part of this ADP. But we do provide not part of this ADP. But we do provide uh the first three decision points of uh the first three decision points of uh the first three decision points of SSVC uh to help defenders uh inform SSVC uh to help defenders uh inform SSVC uh to help defenders uh inform their prioritization of vulnerability mitigation. All right, we told you what mitigation. All right, we told you what mitigation. All right, we told you what a glow-up is. We gave you an example of a glow-up is. We gave you an example of a glow-up is. We gave you an example of a glowed up CVE record. So why is this a glowed up CVE record. So why is this a glowed up CVE record. So why is this even necessary? Why do we need to glow even necessary? Why do we need to glow even necessary? Why do we need to glow up or enrich CVE records? Well, without up or enrich CVE records? Well, without up or enrich CVE records? Well, without that CWE, without the CVS, specifically that CWE, without the CVS, specifically that CWE, without the CVS, specifically the vector string, you know, it's like the vector string, you know, it's like the vector string, you know, it's like uh a map without any landmarks, right? uh a map without any landmarks, right? uh a map without any landmarks, right? Um security teams are really left Um security teams are really left Um security teams are really left guessing. They're misaligned. They're guessing. They're misaligned. They're guessing. They're misaligned. They're wasting resources and they're wasting resources and they're wasting resources and they're potentially leaving vulnerabilities potentially leaving vulnerabilities potentially leaving vulnerabilities unressed. But when a CVE gets that glow unressed. But when a CVE gets that glow unressed. But when a CVE gets that glow up, when it gets that context of, you up, when it gets that context of, you up, when it gets that context of, you know, um the potential weakness that know, um the potential weakness that know, um the potential weakness that caused that vulnerability to occur or caused that vulnerability to occur or caused that vulnerability to occur or the potential severity or the potential the potential severity or the potential the potential severity or the potential technical impacts of that vulnerability, technical impacts of that vulnerability, technical impacts of that vulnerability, if you look on the right, the the the if you look on the right, the the the if you look on the right, the the the road becomes way more clear. You've got road becomes way more clear. You've got road becomes way more clear. You've got a nice shiny bright I love that I have a nice shiny bright I love that I have a nice shiny bright I love that I have this lightsaber. uh a nice shiny bright this lightsaber. uh a nice shiny bright this lightsaber. uh a nice shiny bright sun and that leads again to more sun and that leads again to more sun and that leads again to more informed decision making that is informed decision making that is informed decision making that is incoming uh in the hands of defenders as incoming uh in the hands of defenders as incoming uh in the hands of defenders as opposed to here where it's all dark and opposed to here where it's all dark and opposed to here where it's all dark and cloudy and kind of really confused right cloudy and kind of really confused right cloudy and kind of really confused right here with those squiggles and and not here with those squiggles and and not here with those squiggles and and not really sure where you're going. Okay, I'm going to hand this to going. Okay, I'm going to hand this to going. Okay, I'm going to hand this to Julie actually. So, I told you actually. So, I told you actually. So, I told you why this glow up matters. why this glow up matters. why this glow up matters. Well, let's talk about those individual Well, let's talk about those individual Well, let's talk about those individual components. CWE, who cares about CW in components. CWE, who cares about CW in components. CWE, who cares about CW in this room? A lot of people. CWE is very this room? A lot of people. CWE is very this room? A lot of people. CWE is very important. C.WE helps provide the root important. C.WE helps provide the root important. C.WE helps provide the root cause of a vulnerability. It is the uh cause of a vulnerability. It is the uh cause of a vulnerability. It is the uh weakness that caused it. It's maintained weakness that caused it. It's maintained weakness that caused it. It's maintained by MITER. They do a tremendous job. I by MITER. They do a tremendous job. I by MITER. They do a tremendous job. I know you guys just heard Steve Christie know you guys just heard Steve Christie know you guys just heard Steve Christie uh talk about all about CWE and CWE uh talk about all about CWE and CWE uh talk about all about CWE and CWE mapping. Uh, and it's really essential mapping. Uh, and it's really essential mapping. Uh, and it's really essential to understanding again why to understanding again why to understanding again why vulnerabilities are even coming up. You vulnerabilities are even coming up. You vulnerabilities are even coming up. You can see this tree right here. You've got can see this tree right here. You've got can see this tree right here. You've got the root causes at the bottom and the root causes at the bottom and the root causes at the bottom and they're causing what's coming up out of they're causing what's coming up out of they're causing what's coming up out of the tree. So, we've identified, you the tree. So, we've identified, you the tree. So, we've identified, you know, some groups that care about C.WE. know, some groups that care about C.WE. know, some groups that care about C.WE. And I know a good handful of you raised And I know a good handful of you raised And I know a good handful of you raised your hands. So, I'd love to hear from your hands.

So if you are someone who creates or So if you are someone who creates or So if you are someone who creates or maintains or uh deploys firewalls and maintains or uh deploys firewalls and maintains or uh deploys firewalls and other defensive measures, you care about other defensive measures, you care about other defensive measures, you care about this because you don't want to write a this because you don't want to write a this because you don't want to write a firewall rule for every single problem firewall rule for every single problem firewall rule for every single problem that you see. You want to be able to that you see. You want to be able to that you see. You want to be able to group those problems together. So group those problems together. So group those problems together.

So if we help us better resource teams. So if we help us better resource teams. So if we can show that we're getting clusters of can show that we're getting clusters of can show that we're getting clusters of similar C.WE out of u maybe a particular similar C.WE out of u maybe a particular similar C.WE out of u maybe a particular group of engineers, we can use that to group of engineers, we can use that to group of engineers, we can use that to advocate for better training around um advocate for better training around um advocate for better training around um sort of the root cause of that problem sort of the root cause of that problem sort of the root cause of that problem instead of having to constantly play instead of having to constantly play instead of having to constantly play whack-a-ole with individual whack-a-ole with individual whack-a-ole with individual vulnerabilities that might be showing up vulnerabilities that might be showing up vulnerabilities that might be showing up in that code. Amazing. Flaps and a sticker. Amazing. Flaps and a sticker. Amazing. Flaps and a sticker. Ooh, any final Ooh, any final Ooh, any final answers or answers or answers or input? I need my steps. We've got BSI in input? I need my steps. We've got BSI in input? I need my steps. We've got BSI in the back. And again, why I'm asking why the back. And again, why I'm asking why the back. And again, why I'm asking why everybody cares is because, you know, a everybody cares is because, you know, a everybody cares is because, you know, a big theme of VonCon this time around is, big theme of VonCon this time around is, big theme of VonCon this time around is, you know, CVE completeness. And we need you know, CVE completeness. And we need you know, CVE completeness. And we need to know, you know, one, why are we to know, you know, one, why are we to know, you know, one, why are we needing to add that? And two, who cares? needing to add that? And two, who cares? needing to add that? And two, who cares? And you guys are the people who care. And you guys are the people who care. And you guys are the people who care. And so, it's really beneficial to hear And so, it's really beneficial to hear And so, it's really beneficial to hear why you care. Well, I care because the why you care. Well, I care because the why you care. Well, I care because the CWE helps us identify trends and then CWE helps us identify trends and then CWE helps us identify trends and then educate vendors what they could do educate vendors what they could do educate vendors what they could do actually better. So that's why we deeply actually better. So that's why we deeply actually better. So that's why we deeply care about CWE, but we don't use it. care about CWE, but we don't use it. care about CWE, but we don't use it. I have a lightsaber. We'll get you I have a lightsaber. We'll get you I have a lightsaber. We'll get you there, Tilo. All All All right, head up again. Um, thank you for right, head up again. Um, thank you for right, head up again. Um, thank you for those inputs. I've kind of mapped up those inputs. I've kind of mapped up those inputs. I've kind of mapped up here who we think at a high level cares here who we think at a high level cares here who we think at a high level cares about CWE and why. So we've got security about CWE and why. So we've got security about CWE and why. So we've got security teams. So they need to understand the teams. So they need to understand the teams. So they need to understand the root cause to respond effectively and root cause to respond effectively and root cause to respond effectively and prevent those future prevent those future prevent those future vulnerabilities. Got security vulnerabilities. Got security vulnerabilities. Got security researchers. I'm sure there's a handful researchers. I'm sure there's a handful researchers. I'm sure there's a handful of security researchers in this crowd. of security researchers in this crowd. of security researchers in this crowd. And uh they use CWE to spot trends and And uh they use CWE to spot trends and And uh they use CWE to spot trends and identify patterns and weaknesses across identify patterns and weaknesses across identify patterns and weaknesses across systems. And then we've got code systems. And then we've got code systems. And then we've got code producers. So as Vicilo was mentioning producers. So as Vicilo was mentioning producers. So as Vicilo was mentioning uh and product developers and they can uh and product developers and they can uh and product developers and they can have root causes inform their SDLC to have root causes inform their SDLC to have root causes inform their SDLC to prevent recurring weaknesses uh at the prevent recurring weaknesses uh at the prevent recurring weaknesses uh at the onset. Bob secure by design right there onset. Bob secure by design right there onset. Bob secure by design right there for you. Uh and then senior leadership for you. Uh and then senior leadership for you. Uh and then senior leadership uh it informs their risk management uh it informs their risk management uh it informs their risk management decisions at the organizational decisions at the organizational decisions at the organizational level. Go to the next slide. Okay. So, we talked about who slide. Okay. So, we talked about who slide. Okay. So, we talked about who cares about C.WE. And we'd be remiss to cares about C.WE. And we'd be remiss to cares about C.WE. And we'd be remiss to not mention that there's definitely some not mention that there's definitely some not mention that there's definitely some challenges with CWE. I'm sure we can all challenges with CWE. I'm sure we can all challenges with CWE. I'm sure we can all relate with that. Uh, but there's some relate with that. Uh, but there's some relate with that. Uh, but there's some solutions. So, I'm going to walk through solutions. So, I'm going to walk through solutions. So, I'm going to walk through some of the challenges and I'd love to some of the challenges and I'd love to some of the challenges and I'd love to make this an open discussion, too, and make this an open discussion, too, and make this an open discussion, too, and uh present some solutions and get your uh present some solutions and get your uh present some solutions and get your guys' opinions. So, obviously, you know, guys' opinions. So, obviously, you know, guys' opinions. So, obviously, you know, it can be time consuming and complex. Uh it can be time consuming and complex. Uh it can be time consuming and complex. Uh there's definitely been uh shown to be there's definitely been uh shown to be there's definitely been uh shown to be some inconsistency across organizations some inconsistency across organizations some inconsistency across organizations and CNAs with CWE assignments. Uh and CNAs with CWE assignments. Uh and CNAs with CWE assignments. Uh there's sometimes a difficulty in there's sometimes a difficulty in there's sometimes a difficulty in pinpointing the root cause and you know pinpointing the root cause and you know pinpointing the root cause and you know it's can be a manual effort which time it's can be a manual effort which time it's can be a manual effort which time resources. Uh there's some learning resources. Uh there's some learning resources. Uh there's some learning curves and knowledge gaps in in in how curves and knowledge gaps in in in how curves and knowledge gaps in in in how to assign that C.WE. And then there's to assign that C.WE. And then there's to assign that C.WE. And then there's some CNAs or vendors who are even unsure some CNAs or vendors who are even unsure some CNAs or vendors who are even unsure of the value of disclosing the weakness of the value of disclosing the weakness of the value of disclosing the weakness to the public. Right. Um any other to the public. Right. Um any other to the public. Right. Um any other challenges uh in the audience that I am challenges uh in the audience that I am challenges uh in the audience that I am I'm am missing I'm am missing I'm am missing here. Okay, we did a good job then. Um here. Okay, we did a good job then. Um here. Okay, we did a good job then. Um well, we've got some solutions, right? well, we've got some solutions, right? well, we've got some solutions, right? So, uh we presented some challenges, So, uh we presented some challenges, So, uh we presented some challenges, we've got some solutions. Uh if you're we've got some solutions. Uh if you're we've got some solutions. Uh if you're facing any of these challenges, uh we facing any of these challenges, uh we facing any of these challenges, uh we definitely recommend you guys joining definitely recommend you guys joining definitely recommend you guys joining the root cause mapping working group. I the root cause mapping working group. I the root cause mapping working group. I believe it's uh run by MITER and that'll believe it's uh run by MITER and that'll believe it's uh run by MITER and that'll definitely help uh improve that root definitely help uh improve that root definitely help uh improve that root cause identification. Um, an additional cause identification. Um, an additional cause identification. Um, an additional uh, piece of guidance as well. If you're uh, piece of guidance as well. If you're uh, piece of guidance as well. If you're having difficulty pinpointing which CWE having difficulty pinpointing which CWE having difficulty pinpointing which CWE I would say start at the parent, you I would say start at the parent, you I would say start at the parent, you start at that parent. Don't leave at the start at that parent. Don't leave at the start at that parent. Don't leave at the parent, but leverage the mapping notes parent, but leverage the mapping notes parent, but leverage the mapping notes which have been recently added and uh, which have been recently added and uh, which have been recently added and uh, use those to get as precise as possible. use those to get as precise as possible. use those to get as precise as possible. So, when you start at that parent uh, So, when you start at that parent uh, So, when you start at that parent uh, which is usually a little bit easier to which is usually a little bit easier to which is usually a little bit easier to pick, you can kind of drill down, use pick, you can kind of drill down, use pick, you can kind of drill down, use those mapping notes that a bunch of those mapping notes that a bunch of those mapping notes that a bunch of experts created uh, in the C.WE we uh experts created uh, in the C.WE we uh experts created uh, in the C.WE we uh catalog and uh it'll it'll get you catalog and uh it'll it'll get you catalog and uh it'll it'll get you closer to understanding what that closer to understanding what that closer to understanding what that weakness actually is. Additionally, weakness actually is. Additionally, weakness actually is. Additionally, leverage some AI powered tools to leverage some AI powered tools to leverage some AI powered tools to streamline and automate the assignment streamline and automate the assignment streamline and automate the assignment process. I believe we had some friends process. I believe we had some friends process. I believe we had some friends at AWS um talk about a chatbot, Julia, at AWS um talk about a chatbot, Julia, at AWS um talk about a chatbot, Julia, that's right, CNA Guru. Uh it was very that's right, CNA Guru. Uh it was very that's right, CNA Guru. Uh it was very cool tool that was presented uh cool tool that was presented uh cool tool that was presented uh yesterday and looking forward to yesterday and looking forward to yesterday and looking forward to reviewing that and seeing how it reviewing that and seeing how it reviewing that and seeing how it evolves. Um and then of course the root evolves. Um and then of course the root evolves. Um and then of course the root cause mapping group is also working on cause mapping group is also working on cause mapping group is also working on an AI solution something to help us out an AI solution something to help us out an AI solution something to help us out right with this manual process. There right with this manual process. There right with this manual process. There are so many CWEs to choose from even the are so many CWEs to choose from even the are so many CWEs to choose from even the parent and with all of the ones under parent and with all of the ones under parent and with all of the ones under it. Um and I believe Red Hat also it. Um and I believe Red Hat also it. Um and I believe Red Hat also presented on maybe some other solutions presented on maybe some other solutions presented on maybe some other solutions to uh help us better assign CWEs. But I to uh help us better assign CWEs. But I to uh help us better assign CWEs. But I think what's most important is we need think what's most important is we need think what's most important is we need your input to make those solutions. We your input to make those solutions. We your input to make those solutions. We can't just uh admire the problem like we can't just uh admire the problem like we can't just uh admire the problem like we say at CISA or or whine and complain. say at CISA or or whine and complain. say at CISA or or whine and complain. Let's uh be a part of the solution for Let's uh be a part of the solution for Let's uh be a part of the solution for C.WE because we just had at least three C.WE because we just had at least three C.WE because we just had at least three people say they care about it and it's people say they care about it and it's people say they care about it and it's really important. really important. really important. Thank you Julia. And then lastly, you Thank you Julia. And then lastly, you Thank you Julia. And then lastly, you know, if you're unsure as a vendor or if know, if you're unsure as a vendor or if know, if you're unsure as a vendor or if you're seeing CNAs not putting CWEs, you you're seeing CNAs not putting CWEs, you you're seeing CNAs not putting CWEs, you know, there is value to disclosing the know, there is value to disclosing the know, there is value to disclosing the weakness um to your customers and to the weakness um to your customers and to the weakness um to your customers and to the vulnerability community at large, right? vulnerability community at large, right? vulnerability community at large, right? It's demonstrating accountability and It's demonstrating accountability and It's demonstrating accountability and transparency for the security of your transparency for the security of your transparency for the security of your customers. And so, uh we believe that customers. And so, uh we believe that customers. And so, uh we believe that those solutions are a start to kind of those solutions are a start to kind of those solutions are a start to kind of quelling uh those challenges presented quelling uh those challenges presented quelling uh those challenges presented with C.WE assignment. Any thoughts there with C.WE assignment. Any thoughts there with C.WE assignment. Any thoughts there on the solutions? Anybody have an on the solutions? Anybody have an on the solutions? Anybody have an additional one or or hear of one during additional one or or hear of one during additional one or or hear of one during this week? Yes, sir. Oh, you get a sticker, too. We sir. Oh, you get a sticker, too. We sir. Oh, you get a sticker, too. We cannot forget that. So, uh it's not a solution, but more of So, uh it's not a solution, but more of So, uh it's not a solution, but more of a question. Yeah. So, here you're saying a question. Yeah. So, here you're saying a question. Yeah. So, here you're saying the inconsistency across organization the inconsistency across organization the inconsistency across organization and CNAs. Uh I thought there would be and CNAs. Uh I thought there would be and CNAs. Uh I thought there would be some kind of a um procedure after CNA some kind of a um procedure after CNA some kind of a um procedure after CNA submitted their u vulnerabilities. I submitted their u vulnerabilities. I submitted their u vulnerabilities. I thought there's a committee or something thought there's a committee or something thought there's a committee or something reviewing these like CWE assignment reviewing these like CWE assignment reviewing these like CWE assignment because some of them are not even because some of them are not even because some of them are not even assigned, right? And so there must be assigned, right? And so there must be assigned, right? And so there must be like another layer that's either like another layer that's either like another layer that's either addressing these inconsistencies or fill addressing these inconsistencies or fill addressing these inconsistencies or fill up the empty CWE fuels. Is there such up the empty CWE fuels. Is there such up the empty CWE fuels. Is there such such a a gating process? such a a gating process? such a a gating process? Yeah. So we um so SIZA we're going to Yeah. So we um so SIZA we're going to Yeah. So we um so SIZA we're going to talk about this later. We do a thing talk about this later. We do a thing talk about this later. We do a thing called ven enrichment which is we enrich called ven enrichment which is we enrich called ven enrichment which is we enrich CVE records typically those that are CVE records typically those that are CVE records typically those that are complete with SSVC. Uh but we've complete with SSVC. Uh but we've complete with SSVC. Uh but we've recognized that there are some gaps in recognized that there are some gaps in recognized that there are some gaps in the data and this is the reason why the data and this is the reason why the data and this is the reason why we're here today and uh really talking we're here today and uh really talking we're here today and uh really talking and and encouraging completeness of CVE and and encouraging completeness of CVE and and encouraging completeness of CVE records. Uh so when there are gaps uh records. Uh so when there are gaps uh records. Uh so when there are gaps uh SIZA as an ADP does go in and enrich SIZA as an ADP does go in and enrich SIZA as an ADP does go in and enrich with C.WE and CVSS but ultimately CNA with C.WE and CVSS but ultimately CNA with C.WE and CVSS but ultimately CNA knows best. They know their code best. knows best. They know their code best. knows best. They know their code best. They know their products best and they They know their products best and they They know their products best and they should be the ones that are really you should be the ones that are really you should be the ones that are really you know assigning these things. And what know assigning these things. And what know assigning these things. And what we're doing today is really trying to we're doing today is really trying to we're doing today is really trying to stress how important that is and also stress how important that is and also stress how important that is and also provide some solutions forward for the provide some solutions forward for the provide some solutions forward for the CNAs to be able to do that. CNAs to be able to do that. CNAs to be able to do that. Yeah. Before we iron out any Yeah. Before we iron out any Yeah. Before we iron out any inconsistency, we have to make sure the inconsistency, we have to make sure the inconsistency, we have to make sure the CWE is actually on the record first. Okay. Importance of Okay. Importance of Okay. Importance of CVSS. Who cares about CVSS here? Yeah, CVSS. Who cares about CVSS here? Yeah, CVSS. Who cares about CVSS here? Yeah, you do. A lot of lovely hands. Okay. I you do. A lot of lovely hands. Okay. I you do. A lot of lovely hands. Okay. I want to So CVS again, uh it's a scoring want to So CVS again, uh it's a scoring want to So CVS again, uh it's a scoring system that details a lot of important system that details a lot of important system that details a lot of important properties about vulnerabilities. properties about vulnerabilities. properties about vulnerabilities. Essentially it's providing that uh Essentially it's providing that uh Essentially it's providing that uh potential technical impact and the potential technical impact and the potential technical impact and the potential severity of a vulnerability. potential severity of a vulnerability. potential severity of a vulnerability. It's very important. Uh we uh It's very important. Uh we uh It's very important. Uh we uh specifically like to focus on the vector specifically like to focus on the vector specifically like to focus on the vector string which provides a lot of again string which provides a lot of again string which provides a lot of again detail on those potential technical detail on those potential technical detail on those potential technical impacts and the potential severities. impacts and the potential severities. impacts and the potential severities. See it's this guy right here questioning See it's this guy right here questioning See it's this guy right here questioning you know again what this vulnerability you know again what this vulnerability you know again what this vulnerability is going to be uh as it relates to his is going to be uh as it relates to his is going to be uh as it relates to his unique network. Uh so I saw all those unique network. Uh so I saw all those unique network. Uh so I saw all those hands. I'd love to hear again similar to hands. I'd love to hear again similar to hands. I'd love to hear again similar to CWE. Who are you and why do you care CWE. Who are you and why do you care CWE. Who are you and why do you care about CVSS? Why do you use it? I'm going to go with uh my friend it? I'm going to go with uh my friend it? I'm going to go with uh my friend from Verizon, George. Correct. Thank from Verizon, George. Correct. Thank from Verizon, George. Correct. Thank you, George. So when used correctly, not just a base So when used correctly, not just a base So when used correctly, not just a base score, but also a temporal score, taking score, but also a temporal score, taking score, but also a temporal score, taking in exploitability and your environment in exploitability and your environment in exploitability and your environment and your context, it allows you to and your context, it allows you to and your context, it allows you to prioritize what really needs to get prioritize what really needs to get prioritize what really needs to get fixed because if you have a million fixed because if you have a million fixed because if you have a million criticals, then nothing's really a criticals, then nothing's really a criticals, then nothing's really a critical and you're not focusing on what critical and you're not focusing on what critical and you're not focusing on what you have to. So it allows us to do that you have to. So it allows us to do that you have to. So it allows us to do that when we calculate it correctly. And what when we calculate it correctly. And what when we calculate it correctly. And what type of role do you have at Verizon? I type of role do you have at Verizon? I type of role do you have at Verizon? I run the proactive security team which run the proactive security team which run the proactive security team which includes exposure and vulnerability includes exposure and vulnerability includes exposure and vulnerability management. Okay, awesome. Andrew management. Okay, awesome. Andrew management. Okay, awesome. Andrew Pollock, I saw your hand again. I've got a bit of a bit of a I've got a bit of a bit of a I've got a bit of a bit of a controversial hot take on this one. Uh, controversial hot take on this one. Uh, controversial hot take on this one. Uh, I read the I read the I read the Go Security team, Golang security teams Go Security team, Golang security teams Go Security team, Golang security teams FAQ a while back on why they do not FAQ a while back on why they do not FAQ a while back on why they do not provide severities for their provide severities for their provide severities for their vulnerabilities and it resonated with me vulnerabilities and it resonated with me vulnerabilities and it resonated with me and the gentleman before me provided a and the gentleman before me provided a and the gentleman before me provided a beautifully well-qualified answer. um beautifully well-qualified answer. um beautifully well-qualified answer. um because you know scoring vulnerabilities because you know scoring vulnerabilities because you know scoring vulnerabilities for a global audience is very hard and for a global audience is very hard and for a global audience is very hard and they say we don't provide them because they say we don't provide them because they say we don't provide them because uh the impact of a vulnerability is uh the impact of a vulnerability is uh the impact of a vulnerability is rarely universal which means that rarely universal which means that rarely universal which means that severity indicators can often be severity indicators can often be severity indicators can often be deceptive. deceptive. deceptive. For example, a crash in a plaza may be a For example, a crash in a plaza may be a For example, a crash in a plaza may be a critical severity issue if it's using critical severity issue if it's using critical severity issue if it's using untrusted input or if it's only using untrusted input or if it's only using untrusted input or if it's only using known safe input, then it's not even a known safe input, then it's not even a known safe input, then it's not even a low, right? So, it's subjective. Um, and low, right? So, it's subjective. Um, and low, right? So, it's subjective. Um, and um yeah, so I can appreciate why people um yeah, so I can appreciate why people um yeah, so I can appreciate why people want severity scores because they need want severity scores because they need want severity scores because they need some sort of they need to prioritize, some sort of they need to prioritize, some sort of they need to prioritize, right? But it's very very hard to right? But it's very very hard to right? But it's very very hard to accurately priority provide that that accurately priority provide that that accurately priority provide that that thing for a global audience with with thing for a global audience with with thing for a global audience with with limited context. The environmental limited context. The environmental limited context. The environmental aspect is very very crucial. Completely aspect is very very crucial. Completely aspect is very very crucial. Completely I agree with you Andrew you know uh and I agree with you Andrew you know uh and I agree with you Andrew you know uh and that's why we think again that vector that's why we think again that vector that's why we think again that vector string is so important and to have that string is so important and to have that string is so important and to have that base uh as an input and if you're base uh as an input and if you're base uh as an input and if you're leveraging additional tools that will leveraging additional tools that will leveraging additional tools that will provide uh additional supplemental provide uh additional supplemental provide uh additional supplemental metrics on top of that that are unique metrics on top of that that are unique metrics on top of that that are unique to your environment then you can get a to your environment then you can get a to your environment then you can get a closer uh understanding to what you need closer uh understanding to what you need closer uh understanding to what you need to do in your specific environment and to do in your specific environment and to do in your specific environment and uh it's very hard for one thing to be a uh it's very hard for one thing to be a uh it's very hard for one thing to be a silver bullet and not one data field in silver bullet and not one data field in silver bullet and not one data field in an in a CVE record again is a a silver an in a CVE record again is a a silver an in a CVE record again is a a silver bullet. It's always going to be um you bullet. It's always going to be um you bullet. It's always going to be um you know a a part of the riskmanagement know a a part of the riskmanagement know a a part of the riskmanagement decision-making process, but ultimately decision-making process, but ultimately decision-making process, but ultimately um enhancing that base. You need that um enhancing that base. You need that um enhancing that base. You need that base score to enhance it additionally base score to enhance it additionally base score to enhance it additionally with those threat and environmental with those threat and environmental with those threat and environmental metrics that'll get you a bit closer to metrics that'll get you a bit closer to metrics that'll get you a bit closer to what you would uh need to do. Any other what you would uh need to do. Any other what you would uh need to do. Any other thoughts on who you are and why you thoughts on who you are and why you thoughts on who you are and why you care? Martin from Nestle. So we are from Nestlatin the and we So we are from Nestlatin the and we So we are from Nestlatin the and we manage globally vulnerabilities mainly manage globally vulnerabilities mainly manage globally vulnerabilities mainly on infrastructure and extranatic surface on infrastructure and extranatic surface on infrastructure and extranatic surface and well here for example we are not and well here for example we are not and well here for example we are not really using the scoring of the CBSS but really using the scoring of the CBSS but really using the scoring of the CBSS but we use mainly the attributes to we use mainly the attributes to we use mainly the attributes to calculate our own type of scoring no so calculate our own type of scoring no so calculate our own type of scoring no so very important that this is there and very important that this is there and very important that this is there and also we are looking forward for vendors also we are looking forward for vendors also we are looking forward for vendors migrating to CBSS version 4 that enhance migrating to CBSS version 4 that enhance migrating to CBSS version 4 that enhance this a lot and we will be able to do this a lot and we will be able to do this a lot and we will be able to do much more in our calculation and with much more in our calculation and with much more in our calculation and with some manual checking and confirmations. some manual checking and confirmations. some manual checking and confirmations. Awesome. All right, so we've got some Awesome. All right, so we've got some Awesome. All right, so we've got some documented up here. Thank you all for documented up here. Thank you all for documented up here. Thank you all for contributing to that. Again, really contributing to that. Again, really contributing to that. Again, really important to understand why we care and important to understand why we care and important to understand why we care and who cares. So, we've got security teams. who cares. So, we've got security teams. who cares. So, we've got security teams. They're using that vector string we've They're using that vector string we've They're using that vector string we've been talking about to assess how likely been talking about to assess how likely been talking about to assess how likely vulnerabilities can be exploited and vulnerabilities can be exploited and vulnerabilities can be exploited and their potential impact. Uh developers their potential impact. Uh developers their potential impact. Uh developers understand how vulnerabilities can understand how vulnerabilities can understand how vulnerabilities can affect their code and their systems. And affect their code and their systems. And affect their code and their systems. And we've got the national certs anderts and we've got the national certs anderts and we've got the national certs anderts and they're using it to communicate and they're using it to communicate and they're using it to communicate and alert about important vulnerability alert about important vulnerability alert about important vulnerability properties across agencies. Uh properties across agencies. Uh properties across agencies. Uh additionally sizz and management uh additionally sizz and management uh additionally sizz and management uh gives them that highle understanding of gives them that highle understanding of gives them that highle understanding of how the vulnerability may pack the may how the vulnerability may pack the may how the vulnerability may pack the may impact the organization and to what impact the organization and to what impact the organization and to what extent. Go to the next slide extent. Go to the next slide extent. Go to the next slide please. All right we touched on it a please. All right we touched on it a please. All right we touched on it a little bit. U but I'm going to present little bit. U but I'm going to present little bit. U but I'm going to present some of the challenges and some some of the challenges and some some of the challenges and some solutions. Um so I uh we've got many solutions. Um so I uh we've got many solutions. Um so I uh we've got many tools and um many of them are only using tools and um many of them are only using tools and um many of them are only using the base score which again is just a the base score which again is just a the base score which again is just a general thing that the developer is general thing that the developer is general thing that the developer is providing and it's not really as providing and it's not really as providing and it's not really as specific to somebody's unique specific to somebody's unique specific to somebody's unique environment. Uh we also recognize that environment. Uh we also recognize that environment. Uh we also recognize that CVSS is time consuming. Uh additionally CVSS is time consuming. Uh additionally CVSS is time consuming. Uh additionally accurately selecting the right metrics accurately selecting the right metrics accurately selecting the right metrics in the vector string uh can be very in the vector string uh can be very in the vector string uh can be very difficult. Uh lastly the base vector difficult. Uh lastly the base vector difficult. Uh lastly the base vector strings aren't environment specific. So, strings aren't environment specific. So, strings aren't environment specific. So, Andrew, Martin, what you guys were Andrew, Martin, what you guys were Andrew, Martin, what you guys were saying is exactly right. Um, just the saying is exactly right. Um, just the saying is exactly right. Um, just the base string itself might not even, you base string itself might not even, you base string itself might not even, you know, do much for somebody, you know, know, do much for somebody, you know, know, do much for somebody, you know, trying to reduce risk within their trying to reduce risk within their trying to reduce risk within their organization. Uh, but there there are organization. Uh, but there there are organization. Uh, but there there are some solutions to those challenges. Uh, some solutions to those challenges. Uh, some solutions to those challenges. Uh, so we recommend that you use tools that so we recommend that you use tools that so we recommend that you use tools that consider the vendor string as an consider the vendor string as an consider the vendor string as an input. Additionally, uh, and Martine input. Additionally, uh, and Martine input. Additionally, uh, and Martine mentioned this, uh, consider starting to mentioned this, uh, consider starting to mentioned this, uh, consider starting to use CVSS version 4. Uh there's some use CVSS version 4. Uh there's some use CVSS version 4. Uh there's some really actually great things and really actually great things and really actually great things and improvements in version 4. It's a bit improvements in version 4. It's a bit improvements in version 4. It's a bit simpler and more understandable to use. simpler and more understandable to use. simpler and more understandable to use. Uh it pairs very well with SSVC which we Uh it pairs very well with SSVC which we Uh it pairs very well with SSVC which we all know and love. Uh additionally, I all know and love. Uh additionally, I all know and love. Uh additionally, I think they retired the the much loved or think they retired the the much loved or think they retired the the much loved or much hated. Which one is it? Scope much hated. Which one is it? Scope much hated. Which one is it? Scope metric. How do we feel about the scope metric. How do we feel about the scope metric. How do we feel about the scope metric? Anybody loved it, hated it? It's metric? Anybody loved it, hated it? It's metric? Anybody loved it, hated it? It's gone. I think it's retired. Uh so we gone. I think it's retired. Uh so we gone. I think it's retired. Uh so we definitely definitely definitely Yes. Yes. Yes. Um, and so again, we definitely Um, and so again, we definitely Um, and so again, we definitely recommend using that version 4. Consider recommend using that version 4. Consider recommend using that version 4. Consider using that uh to help with again using that uh to help with again using that uh to help with again accurately selecting those metrics in accurately selecting those metrics in accurately selecting those metrics in the vector string and in reducing some the vector string and in reducing some the vector string and in reducing some time. Uh, if if you're still confused, I time. Uh, if if you're still confused, I time. Uh, if if you're still confused, I would also reference the CVSS SIGs would also reference the CVSS SIGs would also reference the CVSS SIGs examples. Uh, they've got some great examples. Uh, they've got some great examples. Uh, they've got some great examples of how to approach uh this uh examples of how to approach uh this uh examples of how to approach uh this uh vector string. And if you've seen the vector string. And if you've seen the vector string. And if you've seen the examples and you don't think that examples and you don't think that examples and you don't think that they're robust enough, like talk to the they're robust enough, like talk to the they're robust enough, like talk to the uh the SIG leaders. I'm sure many of uh the SIG leaders. I'm sure many of uh the SIG leaders. I'm sure many of them are here. Andrew, are you on the them are here. Andrew, are you on the them are here. Andrew, are you on the SIG? Never mind. Different Andrew, I SIG? Never mind. Different Andrew, I SIG? Never mind. Different Andrew, I think. Um and talk with them if they think. Um and talk with them if they think. Um and talk with them if they need to be improved and you guys need need to be improved and you guys need need to be improved and you guys need more guidance on um how to create that more guidance on um how to create that more guidance on um how to create that vector string in the CVS. Uh we'd love vector string in the CVS. Uh we'd love vector string in the CVS. Uh we'd love to hear from you and and improve those to hear from you and and improve those to hear from you and and improve those examples. examples. examples. Lastly, as we've been talking about, uh, Lastly, as we've been talking about, uh, Lastly, as we've been talking about, uh, let's enhance those base vector strings let's enhance those base vector strings let's enhance those base vector strings with threat and environmental metrics. with threat and environmental metrics. with threat and environmental metrics. That's going to get you closer to making That's going to get you closer to making That's going to get you closer to making a risk informed decision because that a risk informed decision because that a risk informed decision because that base that base metric is only uh again base that base metric is only uh again base that base metric is only uh again uh the developer's best guess and you uh the developer's best guess and you uh the developer's best guess and you really need to understand how that might really need to understand how that might really need to understand how that might potentially impact and to what severity potentially impact and to what severity potentially impact and to what severity potentially your environment and so potentially your environment and so potentially your environment and so those additional metrics are are very those additional metrics are are very those additional metrics are are very necessary. Thank you, Reena. That was so much good Thank you, Reena. That was so much good Thank you, Reena. That was so much good information about what we can add to our information about what we can add to our information about what we can add to our CVE records to glow them up. Um, that CVE records to glow them up. Um, that CVE records to glow them up. Um, that is, you know, what CNAs can do for their is, you know, what CNAs can do for their is, you know, what CNAs can do for their own records. And it's one thing to talk own records. And it's one thing to talk own records. And it's one thing to talk the talk, but I would also like to share the talk, but I would also like to share the talk, but I would also like to share how CISA is walking the walk to glow up how CISA is walking the walk to glow up how CISA is walking the walk to glow up our very own records. That's Julia. So our uh first glow up aspect we are So our uh first glow up aspect we are So our uh first glow up aspect we are going to talk about is vone enrichment. going to talk about is vone enrichment. going to talk about is vone enrichment. You may have heard our colleagues You may have heard our colleagues You may have heard our colleagues earlier at the conference talking about earlier at the conference talking about earlier at the conference talking about vulnerrichment. Um first of all we vulnerrichment. Um first of all we vulnerrichment. Um first of all we provide uh we have this resources and provide uh we have this resources and provide uh we have this resources and capacity to be able to score um the capacity to be able to score um the capacity to be able to score um the majority of uh vulner CVEes with SSVC majority of uh vulner CVEes with SSVC majority of uh vulner CVEes with SSVC the first three decision points and CISA the first three decision points and CISA the first three decision points and CISA is particularly interested in that is particularly interested in that is particularly interested in that because it helps us as one part of our because it helps us as one part of our because it helps us as one part of our whole analysis to protect critical whole analysis to protect critical whole analysis to protect critical infrastructure and reduce risk to it. um infrastructure and reduce risk to it. um infrastructure and reduce risk to it. um in addition and so SSVC also helps in addition and so SSVC also helps in addition and so SSVC also helps inform like exploitability, impact and inform like exploitability, impact and inform like exploitability, impact and automatability. So that's why we uh are automatability. So that's why we uh are automatability. So that's why we uh are taking upon ourselves to add those three taking upon ourselves to add those three taking upon ourselves to add those three decision decision points to CVEes. We decision decision points to CVEes. We decision decision points to CVEes. We also uh put a little KEV flag on CVE also uh put a little KEV flag on CVE also uh put a little KEV flag on CVE that uh well are exploited or known that uh well are exploited or known that uh well are exploited or known exploited vulnerabilities. Um, shout out exploited vulnerabilities. Um, shout out exploited vulnerabilities. Um, shout out to the KEV and their team because I have to the KEV and their team because I have to the KEV and their team because I have heard uh from you all throughout the heard uh from you all throughout the heard uh from you all throughout the conference that not only do governments conference that not only do governments conference that not only do governments rely on the KEV uh and within our own rely on the KEV uh and within our own rely on the KEV uh and within our own FSAB, but industry partners look to it FSAB, but industry partners look to it FSAB, but industry partners look to it as a significant resource to bolster as a significant resource to bolster as a significant resource to bolster their uh cyber defense as well. Um, and their uh cyber defense as well. Um, and their uh cyber defense as well. Um, and lastly, like we've all talked about, uh, lastly, like we've all talked about, uh, lastly, like we've all talked about, uh, C.WE and CVSS. This is supposed to add C.WE and CVSS. This is supposed to add C.WE and CVSS. This is supposed to add clarity and technical value on the clarity and technical value on the clarity and technical value on the severity of vulnerabilities. And CISA severity of vulnerabilities. And CISA severity of vulnerabilities. And CISA adds these where they're missing. Um adds these where they're missing. Um adds these where they're missing. Um throughout the CVE catalog, we take a throughout the CVE catalog, we take a throughout the CVE catalog, we take a look at what where there's um data gaps. look at what where there's um data gaps. look at what where there's um data gaps. So if a CWE is missing, CISA will go So if a CWE is missing, CISA will go So if a CWE is missing, CISA will go ahead and uh put a C.WE on it. And uh ahead and uh put a C.WE on it. And uh ahead and uh put a C.WE on it. And uh same with CVSS. We do this to the best same with CVSS. We do this to the best same with CVSS. We do this to the best of our ability with the description of our ability with the description of our ability with the description provided by the CNA. It's important to provided by the CNA. It's important to provided by the CNA. It's important to note that all of these additions by CISA note that all of these additions by CISA note that all of these additions by CISA are dynamic. We know we don't know best. are dynamic. We know we don't know best. are dynamic. We know we don't know best. As Reena said, the CNAs with their scope As Reena said, the CNAs with their scope As Reena said, the CNAs with their scope know their vulnerabilities and their know their vulnerabilities and their know their vulnerabilities and their products the best. They're the ones products the best. They're the ones products the best. They're the ones sitting with the code. They know the sitting with the code. They know the sitting with the code. They know the environments it's used in, etc. So, we environments it's used in, etc. So, we environments it's used in, etc. So, we also have a feedback loop on GitHub. So also have a feedback loop on GitHub. So also have a feedback loop on GitHub. So you can uh put in a request and say hey you can uh put in a request and say hey you can uh put in a request and say hey I think the wrong C.WE was assigned or I think the wrong C.WE was assigned or I think the wrong C.WE was assigned or hey I don't think the score is right and hey I don't think the score is right and hey I don't think the score is right and you know we'll remove our addition once you know we'll remove our addition once you know we'll remove our addition once the CNA updates the record. And it's the CNA updates the record. And it's the CNA updates the record. And it's beautiful how automated the whole beautiful how automated the whole beautiful how automated the whole process is because as a CVE consumer you process is because as a CVE consumer you process is because as a CVE consumer you ingest those automatically. You don't ingest those automatically. You don't ingest those automatically. You don't have to sign up for the SISA updates or have to sign up for the SISA updates or have to sign up for the SISA updates or the CNA updates. Whenever you update the CNA updates. Whenever you update the CNA updates. Whenever you update your system CVE will always have the your system CVE will always have the your system CVE will always have the most updated information. And I'm going most updated information. And I'm going most updated information. And I'm going to ask too, has anybody in this room to ask too, has anybody in this room to ask too, has anybody in this room contributed on the GitHub to our van contributed on the GitHub to our van contributed on the GitHub to our van enrichment effort? I know Chris has. enrichment effort? I know Chris has. enrichment effort? I know Chris has. Anyone else? Anyone used the Anyone else? Anyone used the Anyone else? Anyone used the Kev? Love it. Woo. Perfect. So, the second part of the way Perfect. So, the second part of the way Perfect. So, the second part of the way CISA is glowing up CVE records is CISA is glowing up CVE records is CISA is glowing up CVE records is through our CNA recruitment efforts. And through our CNA recruitment efforts. And through our CNA recruitment efforts. And so to become a CNA, the three so to become a CNA, the three so to become a CNA, the three requirements are to have a vulnerability requirements are to have a vulnerability requirements are to have a vulnerability disclosure policy, a public source for disclosure policy, a public source for disclosure policy, a public source for new vulnerabilities, and to agree to the new vulnerabilities, and to agree to the new vulnerabilities, and to agree to the CVE terms of use. Um, these requirements CVE terms of use. Um, these requirements CVE terms of use. Um, these requirements has made uh the standard to become a CNA has made uh the standard to become a CNA has made uh the standard to become a CNA very accessible. Um, but what we're very accessible. Um, but what we're very accessible. Um, but what we're looking for in our CNAs under the SISA looking for in our CNAs under the SISA looking for in our CNAs under the SISA root is that you are communicative, root is that you are communicative, root is that you are communicative, you're transparent, you embrace the you're transparent, you embrace the you're transparent, you embrace the philosophy of sharing vulnerabilities philosophy of sharing vulnerabilities philosophy of sharing vulnerabilities that are within your products. Um, and that are within your products. Um, and that are within your products. Um, and you are actively going to to the best of you are actively going to to the best of you are actively going to to the best of your ability produce complete, accurate, your ability produce complete, accurate, your ability produce complete, accurate, and timely CVE records. And if you're an and timely CVE records. And if you're an and timely CVE records. And if you're an all-star, you'll make the CVE programs all-star, you'll make the CVE programs all-star, you'll make the CVE programs data enrichment recognition list that's data enrichment recognition list that's data enrichment recognition list that's published every two weeks. published every two weeks. published every two weeks. So I have a little stat up here. Um So I have a little stat up here. Um So I have a little stat up here. Um between September 1, 2024 and April 1, between September 1, 2024 and April 1, between September 1, 2024 and April 1, 2025, the CNAs under the CIS IC ICS 2025, the CNAs under the CIS IC ICS 2025, the CNAs under the CIS IC ICS route published 569 CVEEs. 95% of those route published 569 CVEEs. 95% of those route published 569 CVEEs. 95% of those records included C.WE and 64% included records included C.WE and 64% included records included C.WE and 64% included CVSS. And so by, you know, promoting CVSS. And so by, you know, promoting CVSS. And so by, you know, promoting these good habits and teaching and these good habits and teaching and these good habits and teaching and onboarding CNAs, we're contributing to onboarding CNAs, we're contributing to onboarding CNAs, we're contributing to quality information in the ecosystem quality information in the ecosystem quality information in the ecosystem that everyone who consumes it can that everyone who consumes it can that everyone who consumes it can benefit from a little bit more on that. So from a little bit more on that. So from a little bit more on that. So oftent times we receive CNA recruitment oftent times we receive CNA recruitment oftent times we receive CNA recruitment leads from organizations we have leads from organizations we have leads from organizations we have coordinated disclosures with in the coordinated disclosures with in the coordinated disclosures with in the past. throughout the disclosure. They've past. throughout the disclosure. They've past. throughout the disclosure. They've been communicative and transparent. been communicative and transparent. been communicative and transparent. They've worked with us. They've been They've worked with us. They've been They've worked with us. They've been responsive at the bottom line. Um, back responsive at the bottom line. Um, back responsive at the bottom line. Um, back in the CVE fall workshop, actually, uh, in the CVE fall workshop, actually, uh, in the CVE fall workshop, actually, uh, Todd Beardsley did a wordcloud about Todd Beardsley did a wordcloud about Todd Beardsley did a wordcloud about what makes a CNA, what makes a CNA, what makes a CNA, uh, have bad behavior, and it's, you uh, have bad behavior, and it's, you uh, have bad behavior, and it's, you know, not responding, lying, lawyers, know, not responding, lying, lawyers, know, not responding, lying, lawyers, scary stuff like that. scary stuff like that. scary stuff like that. So that we're looking for CNAs who are So that we're looking for CNAs who are So that we're looking for CNAs who are going to demonstrate mature going to demonstrate mature going to demonstrate mature vulnerability management including vulnerability management including vulnerability management including communication and um you know the communication and um you know the communication and um you know the willingness to air their dirty laundry willingness to air their dirty laundry willingness to air their dirty laundry so to speak because you know it's not so to speak because you know it's not so to speak because you know it's not bad. You know that software is going to bad. You know that software is going to bad. You know that software is going to have vulnerabilities and if it doesn't have vulnerabilities and if it doesn't have vulnerabilities and if it doesn't then you're not looking hard then you're not looking hard then you're not looking hard enough. Um so here we have uh as I said enough. Um so here we have uh as I said enough. Um so here we have uh as I said some leads. Let me get my some leads. Let me get my some leads. Let me get my lightsaber leads during our CVD process lightsaber leads during our CVD process lightsaber leads during our CVD process looking for mature vulnerability looking for mature vulnerability looking for mature vulnerability management and at the end of the day um management and at the end of the day um management and at the end of the day um CNAs are empowered to share CNAs are empowered to share CNAs are empowered to share vulnerabilities in their products and vulnerabilities in their products and vulnerabilities in their products and they are held accountable by their uh they are held accountable by their uh they are held accountable by their uh customers. So, as I said, good habits customers. So, as I said, good habits customers. So, as I said, good habits look like complete, accurate, and timely look like complete, accurate, and timely look like complete, accurate, and timely record publication. Um, publishing CVEes record publication. Um, publishing CVEes record publication. Um, publishing CVEes for known vulnerabilities. And SISA for known vulnerabilities. And SISA for known vulnerabilities. And SISA likes to point out that's for internally likes to point out that's for internally likes to point out that's for internally discovered and externally discovered. discovered and externally discovered. discovered and externally discovered. Knowing a vulnerability exists doesn't Knowing a vulnerability exists doesn't Knowing a vulnerability exists doesn't really help anyone. So, publishing a CVE really help anyone. So, publishing a CVE really help anyone. So, publishing a CVE and adding that enriched information is and adding that enriched information is and adding that enriched information is helpful. Um, and then going back to what helpful. Um, and then going back to what helpful. Um, and then going back to what makes a good CVE record, a quality makes a good CVE record, a quality makes a good CVE record, a quality description. So that's going to have description. So that's going to have description. So that's going to have that comprehensive list of products that comprehensive list of products that comprehensive list of products that's also going to have the CVSS that's also going to have the CVSS that's also going to have the CVSS score. It's not just in the JSON format. score. It's not just in the JSON format. score. It's not just in the JSON format. It's also in the human readable format It's also in the human readable format It's also in the human readable format to make sure that every consumer, you to make sure that every consumer, you to make sure that every consumer, you know, gets that information. And of know, gets that information. And of know, gets that information. And of course the beloved CWE and CVSS that course the beloved CWE and CVSS that course the beloved CWE and CVSS that we've talked we've talked we've talked about and you know we recognize that about and you know we recognize that about and you know we recognize that there's a delicate balance between there's a delicate balance between there's a delicate balance between giving an attacker a potential roadmap giving an attacker a potential roadmap giving an attacker a potential roadmap to exploiting these vulnerabilities. And to exploiting these vulnerabilities. And to exploiting these vulnerabilities. And that's kind of one of the things SISA that's kind of one of the things SISA that's kind of one of the things SISA takes pride in is mentoring the CNAs takes pride in is mentoring the CNAs takes pride in is mentoring the CNAs under under under them. All right, we have about 7 to 10 them. All right, we have about 7 to 10 them. All right, we have about 7 to 10 minutes. Just checking minutes. Just checking minutes. Just checking in. So after recruiting, when we onboard in. So after recruiting, when we onboard in. So after recruiting, when we onboard CNAs, we coach them through their first CNAs, we coach them through their first CNAs, we coach them through their first CVE assignments. We host refresher CVE assignments. We host refresher CVE assignments. We host refresher trainings. We demo CVE services. In one trainings. We demo CVE services. In one trainings. We demo CVE services. In one recent instance, uh a CNA wanted to show recent instance, uh a CNA wanted to show recent instance, uh a CNA wanted to show a different CVSs score for their a different CVSs score for their a different CVSs score for their different product versions. So we different product versions. So we different product versions. So we leverage phonogram for the different leverage phonogram for the different leverage phonogram for the different scoring scenarios feature. Another time scoring scenarios feature. Another time scoring scenarios feature. Another time we helped a CNA pick out the correct we helped a CNA pick out the correct we helped a CNA pick out the correct C.WE so that they could correctly inform C.WE so that they could correctly inform C.WE so that they could correctly inform their customers or rather their their customers or rather their their customers or rather their consumers about the underlying weakness consumers about the underlying weakness consumers about the underlying weakness and make sure their messaging was and make sure their messaging was and make sure their messaging was overall consistent. overall consistent. overall consistent. Um, other ways we upscale CNAs are to Um, other ways we upscale CNAs are to Um, other ways we upscale CNAs are to encourage working group participation encourage working group participation encourage working group participation and outlined here are three that are a and outlined here are three that are a and outlined here are three that are a great start including the CNA great start including the CNA great start including the CNA organization of peers uh, and root cause organization of peers uh, and root cause organization of peers uh, and root cause mapping group as Reena said and C.WE CVE mapping group as Reena said and C.WE CVE mapping group as Reena said and C.WE CVE user experience working user experience working user experience working group. Is anybody in this room in any of group. Is anybody in this room in any of group. Is anybody in this room in any of those working those working those working groups? Amazing. I'm in the root cause groups? Amazing. I'm in the root cause groups? Amazing. I'm in the root cause mapping working group as I mentioned. I mapping working group as I mentioned. I mapping working group as I mentioned. I love ZWE. So what does what is the result of this So what does what is the result of this So what does what is the result of this coaching? How has it you know shown up coaching? How has it you know shown up coaching? How has it you know shown up in our CVE records? Um well as I shared in our CVE records? Um well as I shared in our CVE records? Um well as I shared before 95% of records uh included CWES before 95% of records uh included CWES before 95% of records uh included CWES for uh CNAs under the SISA route. um 19 for uh CNAs under the SISA route. um 19 for uh CNAs under the SISA route. um 19 CNAs under SISA have made the data CNAs under SISA have made the data CNAs under SISA have made the data enrichment recognition list every single enrichment recognition list every single enrichment recognition list every single time and uh not even CISA has made it time and uh not even CISA has made it time and uh not even CISA has made it every single time. So that was a I'm every single time. So that was a I'm every single time. So that was a I'm very proud of those uh very proud of those uh very proud of those uh CNAs. Um and then we also have 64% of CNAs. Um and then we also have 64% of CNAs. Um and then we also have 64% of the records were considered complete and the records were considered complete and the records were considered complete and for the purposes of this presentation for the purposes of this presentation for the purposes of this presentation that includes CWE and CVSS TLDDR. Don't be this person. Yeah. Be TLDDR. Don't be this person. Yeah. Be TLDDR. Don't be this person. Yeah. Be this this this person. You know, we we all say we want person. You know, we we all say we want person. You know, we we all say we want better input into the the ecosystem. We better input into the the ecosystem. We better input into the the ecosystem. We all want better CVEes, better informed all want better CVEes, better informed all want better CVEes, better informed tools, things like that. And that starts tools, things like that. And that starts tools, things like that. And that starts at the CNAs. You guys love these memes. Okay, CNAs. You guys love these memes. Okay, CNAs. You guys love these memes. Okay, good. Um, call to action. Let's get your good. Um, call to action. Let's get your good. Um, call to action. Let's get your glow up on. Right. So, you've got glow up on. Right. So, you've got glow up on. Right. So, you've got Spongebob is the downstream CVE users, Spongebob is the downstream CVE users, Spongebob is the downstream CVE users, right? and he's and he's yelling about right? and he's and he's yelling about right? and he's and he's yelling about wanting enriched CBE records and his wanting enriched CBE records and his wanting enriched CBE records and his friend's asking him when does he want friend's asking him when does he want friend's asking him when does he want them? He wants them now. He wants them them? He wants them now. He wants them them? He wants them now. He wants them in the past, the present, and in the in the past, the present, and in the in the past, the present, and in the future records. So today, I want you to take records. So today, I want you to take records. So today, I want you to take away if you're a CNA, I encourage you to away if you're a CNA, I encourage you to away if you're a CNA, I encourage you to enrich your records with C.WE and CVSS. enrich your records with C.WE and CVSS. enrich your records with C.WE and CVSS. If you're a researcher, we want your If you're a researcher, we want your If you're a researcher, we want your feedback. Are these assignments accurate feedback. Are these assignments accurate feedback. Are these assignments accurate from your own research? We want you from your own research? We want you from your own research? We want you participating in the GitHub and you know participating in the GitHub and you know participating in the GitHub and you know the CNA community to make sure that the the CNA community to make sure that the the CNA community to make sure that the all stakeholders are involved and have all stakeholders are involved and have all stakeholders are involved and have input. And then if you're a downstream input. And then if you're a downstream input. And then if you're a downstream user, we want to hear you too. What data user, we want to hear you too. What data user, we want to hear you too. What data points are missing from CVE records? points are missing from CVE records? points are missing from CVE records? because we can educate CNAs and because we can educate CNAs and because we can educate CNAs and contribute through volrichment and other contribute through volrichment and other contribute through volrichment and other efforts to better uh you know create a efforts to better uh you know create a efforts to better uh you know create a better robust better robust better robust ecosystem. CVE is the public's ecosystem. CVE is the public's ecosystem. CVE is the public's definitive source for publicly disclosed definitive source for publicly disclosed definitive source for publicly disclosed vulnerabilities and it's only as vulnerabilities and it's only as vulnerabilities and it's only as valuable as the data we input into it. valuable as the data we input into it. valuable as the data we input into it. It's only as trustworthy as the data we It's only as trustworthy as the data we It's only as trustworthy as the data we put into it. So what do you say? Let's put into it. So what do you say? Let's put into it. So what do you say? Let's give your CVE records a glow up. And I think we have some slides and some And I think we have some slides and some And I think we have some slides and some contact information, our emails, and contact information, our emails, and contact information, our emails, and then I think we have our LinkedIns as then I think we have our LinkedIns as then I think we have our LinkedIns as well. Um, questions from the well. Um, questions from the well. Um, questions from the audience. We got to start with you since audience. We got to start with you since audience. We got to start with you since I've heard from Andrew Pollock. Yeah, thank you. Um, my name is Sil Yeah, thank you. Um, my name is Sil Yeah, thank you. Um, my name is Sil coming from France. I just have a quick coming from France. I just have a quick coming from France. I just have a quick question. I'm surprised you didn't question. I'm surprised you didn't question. I'm surprised you didn't mention CP enrichment part of this glow mention CP enrichment part of this glow mention CP enrichment part of this glow up journey, you know, because I mean up journey, you know, because I mean up journey, you know, because I mean what is the purpose of having a what is the purpose of having a what is the purpose of having a manificent information about manificent information about manificent information about vulnerabilities if you are not able to vulnerabilities if you are not able to vulnerabilities if you are not able to make the accurate link with your make the accurate link with your make the accurate link with your software inventory? software inventory? software inventory? Hey, that's a really great question and Hey, that's a really great question and Hey, that's a really great question and um initially with vulnerrichment we were um initially with vulnerrichment we were um initially with vulnerrichment we were enriching with CPE and then we decided enriching with CPE and then we decided enriching with CPE and then we decided to stop. Currently, I believe only two to stop. Currently, I believe only two to stop. Currently, I believe only two CNAs are adding CPE to their records. CNAs are adding CPE to their records. CNAs are adding CPE to their records. And so, while, you know, we do value And so, while, you know, we do value And so, while, you know, we do value software identification, and it's a software identification, and it's a software identification, and it's a really tricky problem, you know, and uh really tricky problem, you know, and uh really tricky problem, you know, and uh we're open to changing the definition of we're open to changing the definition of we're open to changing the definition of what completeness means, um for right what completeness means, um for right what completeness means, um for right now, we're considering, you know, having now, we're considering, you know, having now, we're considering, you know, having a good description that um mentions the a good description that um mentions the a good description that um mentions the products and versions that are affected products and versions that are affected products and versions that are affected um as as a stepping stone towards, you um as as a stepping stone towards, you um as as a stepping stone towards, you know, um understanding which software is know, um understanding which software is know, um understanding which software is affected. But uh would love to hear your affected. But uh would love to hear your affected. But uh would love to hear your thoughts on CPE in the future and um thoughts on CPE in the future and um thoughts on CPE in the future and um we'd love to consider it as a complete we'd love to consider it as a complete we'd love to consider it as a complete record. But for right now, we're just record. But for right now, we're just record. But for right now, we're just going to have uh that definition be CWE going to have uh that definition be CWE going to have uh that definition be CWE and CVSS. But thank you for that comment. Is CPE important to you? Okay. Questions? Till Okay. Questions? Till Okay. Questions? Till I I I don't. Yes. To decide what the CNA will don't. Yes. To decide what the CNA will don't. Yes. To decide what the CNA will have to do. So why don't you just have to do. So why don't you just have to do. So why don't you just enforce the CMA that are coming to use enforce the CMA that are coming to use enforce the CMA that are coming to use GWS as my requirement whenever they that's a great question and we're that's a great question and we're that's a great question and we're currently working to and so why Julia currently working to and so why Julia currently working to and so why Julia mentioned those stats is like hey we mentioned those stats is like hey we mentioned those stats is like hey we even have room for improvement. We're even have room for improvement. We're even have room for improvement. We're not here just saying like hey we've got not here just saying like hey we've got not here just saying like hey we've got everything covered. We're doing all of everything covered. We're doing all of everything covered. We're doing all of the things like we have some room to the things like we have some room to the things like we have some room to make improvement and Julia is currently make improvement and Julia is currently make improvement and Julia is currently upskilling CNAs to get to that goal of upskilling CNAs to get to that goal of upskilling CNAs to get to that goal of completeness as well. Julia, anything in completeness as well. Julia, anything in completeness as well. Julia, anything in addition? Yeah. Awesome diagram of all the Yeah. Awesome diagram of all the Yeah. Awesome diagram of all the analysis analysis analysis they do. But there's such variety they do. But there's such variety they do. But there's such variety between the CNA funding system which are between the CNA funding system which are between the CNA funding system which are 66 that um you know we want to work with 66 that um you know we want to work with 66 that um you know we want to work with CNAs with what's most valuable to them CNAs with what's most valuable to them CNAs with what's most valuable to them and we also want to work with downturn and we also want to work with downturn and we also want to work with downturn users what information is valuable to users what information is valuable to users what information is valuable to them. So I would say the variety um them. So I would say the variety um them. So I would say the variety um while we can't provide individualized while we can't provide individualized while we can't provide individualized attention we're very fortunate to do attention we're very fortunate to do attention we're very fortunate to do that the variety um you know prevents us that the variety um you know prevents us that the variety um you know prevents us from you know from you know from you know uh the TV program is a voluntary program uh the TV program is a voluntary program uh the TV program is a voluntary program it depends on participation from the it depends on participation from the it depends on participation from the community and so if you want to be in um community and so if you want to be in um community and so if you want to be in um you know make your voice heard and that you know make your voice heard and that you know make your voice heard and that on the other too on the other too on the other too I think that question showed a a I think that question showed a a I think that question showed a a misconception that I've um seen a few misconception that I've um seen a few misconception that I've um seen a few times where there is no data flow times where there is no data flow times where there is no data flow through that hierarchy of CNAs and root through that hierarchy of CNAs and root through that hierarchy of CNAs and root CNAs. It's purely administrative but I CNAs. It's purely administrative but I CNAs. It's purely administrative but I think people who don't understand how think people who don't understand how think people who don't understand how the sausage is made think that it does. the sausage is made think that it does. the sausage is made think that it does. Right. So I've heard that before as Right. So I've heard that before as Right. So I've heard that before as well. Um the CV program is being used well. Um the CV program is being used well. Um the CV program is being used globally. You you you've made that globally. You you you've made that globally. You you you've made that acknowledgement um at the very acknowledgement um at the very acknowledgement um at the very beginning. It currently has a very beginning. It currently has a very beginning. It currently has a very American accent if you will. Sorry. Um, American accent if you will. Sorry. Um, American accent if you will. Sorry. Um, as as you know, it's an interesting as as you know, it's an interesting as as you know, it's an interesting decade, right? Like where the world is decade, right? Like where the world is decade, right? Like where the world is pivoting a little bit more regional and pivoting a little bit more regional and pivoting a little bit more regional and nationalistic at the minute. How do we nationalistic at the minute. How do we nationalistic at the minute. How do we avoid a whole bunch of unintended avoid a whole bunch of unintended avoid a whole bunch of unintended consequences from that that undermine consequences from that that undermine consequences from that that undermine the ultimate objective here of global the ultimate objective here of global the ultimate objective here of global improvement to cyber security, right? improvement to cyber security, right? improvement to cyber security, right? Like like it's a glo the internet is Like like it's a glo the internet is Like like it's a glo the internet is still a global thing even if we get a still a global thing even if we get a still a global thing even if we get a bit more nationalistic. So I'd hate for bit more nationalistic. So I'd hate for bit more nationalistic. So I'd hate for like Ana for example to cause a whole like Ana for example to cause a whole like Ana for example to cause a whole bunch of duplicated effort or bunch of duplicated effort or bunch of duplicated effort or diminished like can we mitigate that by diminished like can we mitigate that by diminished like can we mitigate that by making the CV making the CV making the CV program have more diverse funding. program have more diverse funding. program have more diverse funding. So we're currently working with a lot of So we're currently working with a lot of So we're currently working with a lot of globals and again it is a global globals and again it is a global globals and again it is a global program. Um I think to one of your program. Um I think to one of your program. Um I think to one of your points about uh the American accent I'm points about uh the American accent I'm points about uh the American accent I'm actually calling my friend Michelle from actually calling my friend Michelle from actually calling my friend Michelle from Cisco. She writes a lot of the Cisco. She writes a lot of the Cisco. She writes a lot of the advisories and she we had a conversation advisories and she we had a conversation advisories and she we had a conversation the other night uh that she writes them the other night uh that she writes them the other night uh that she writes them in a way that is easily translatable in a way that is easily translatable in a way that is easily translatable into other languages. Um Michelle did into other languages. Um Michelle did into other languages. Um Michelle did you want to add anything? Sure. So part you want to add anything? Sure. So part you want to add anything? Sure. So part of the the content management system in of the the content management system in of the the content management system in Cisco PERT is we have a team of four Cisco PERT is we have a team of four Cisco PERT is we have a team of four technical editors and we work with our technical editors and we work with our technical editors and we work with our incident managers to um to get our incident managers to um to get our incident managers to um to get our advisories into what we call global advisories into what we call global advisories into what we call global English which is you know you're nodding English which is you know you're nodding English which is you know you're nodding your head you understand what that your head you understand what that your head you understand what that means. So you're you're making them very means. So you're you're making them very means. So you're you're making them very easily translatable. You want a words easily translatable. You want a words easily translatable. You want a words that have want to use words that have that have want to use words that have that have want to use words that have one meaning, not four or five meanings. one meaning, not four or five meanings. one meaning, not four or five meanings. So then if it's somebody on the team who So then if it's somebody on the team who So then if it's somebody on the team who kind of knows enough English to kind of kind of knows enough English to kind of kind of knows enough English to kind of translate, they can get it right. If translate, they can get it right. If translate, they can get it right. If you're putting it through a translation you're putting it through a translation you're putting it through a translation program, you can get it right. And so program, you can get it right. And so program, you can get it right. And so that's definitely a focus and something that's definitely a focus and something that's definitely a focus and something that's bubbled to the top for me since that's bubbled to the top for me since that's bubbled to the top for me since I've been here and would like to, you I've been here and would like to, you I've been here and would like to, you know, get that get that message out know, get that get that message out know, get that get that message out there better for people who have who there better for people who have who there better for people who have who have content teams or don't have the have content teams or don't have the have content teams or don't have the luxury of a content team and make it luxury of a content team and make it luxury of a content team and make it easier if you're writing and you don't easier if you're writing and you don't easier if you're writing and you don't have editing have editing have editing backup. Is that that? No, no, no. Not backup. Is that that? No, no, no. Not backup. Is that that? No, no, no. Not what you not what you were looking for. what you not what you were looking for. what you not what you were looking for. I think if I may, the point is with the I think if I may, the point is with the I think if I may, the point is with the funding. No, no, no, no. I I think I I funding. No, no, no, no. I I think I I funding. No, no, no, no. I I think I I think I got you as this the person who think I got you as this the person who think I got you as this the person who recruits CNAs, right? So of course I my recruits CNAs, right? So of course I my recruits CNAs, right? So of course I my scope is for ICS and medical device and scope is for ICS and medical device and scope is for ICS and medical device and critical infrastructure but that uh the critical infrastructure but that uh the critical infrastructure but that uh the participation from the global community participation from the global community participation from the global community like they're welcome to join and my like they're welcome to join and my like they're welcome to join and my outreach goes beyond those uh like outreach goes beyond those uh like outreach goes beyond those uh like boundaries right where we see taking an boundaries right where we see taking an boundaries right where we see taking an active role is to also be ambassadors active role is to also be ambassadors active role is to also be ambassadors for CNAs within their own countries even for CNAs within their own countries even for CNAs within their own countries even if they are not a CNA themselves um and if they are not a CNA themselves um and if they are not a CNA themselves um and so I think it's getting the outreach so I think it's getting the outreach so I think it's getting the outreach to um you know encourage a more diverse to um you know encourage a more diverse to um you know encourage a more diverse participation. So I would love you for participation. So I would love you for participation. So I would love you for instance to introduce me to some instance to introduce me to some instance to introduce me to some Australian companies that should become Australian companies that should become Australian companies that should become CNAs. I can't speak to that but what I CNAs. I can't speak to that but what I CNAs. I can't speak to that but what I can speak to is uh CVE record glow-ups, can speak to is uh CVE record glow-ups, can speak to is uh CVE record glow-ups, the importance of C.WE, we the the importance of C.WE, we the the importance of C.WE, we the importance of CVSS, the importance of importance of CVSS, the importance of importance of CVSS, the importance of sharing information amongst each other, sharing information amongst each other, sharing information amongst each other, the importance of public private the importance of public private the importance of public private partnerships when it comes to partnerships when it comes to partnerships when it comes to vulnerability information sharing and um vulnerability information sharing and um vulnerability information sharing and um the importance of creating these the importance of creating these the importance of creating these partnerships at the conference and going partnerships at the conference and going partnerships at the conference and going beyond video calls are an amazing thing. beyond video calls are an amazing thing. beyond video calls are an amazing thing. Um if you are interested in knowing more Um if you are interested in knowing more Um if you are interested in knowing more about becoming a CNA and increasing about becoming a CNA and increasing about becoming a CNA and increasing global participation maybe from an global participation maybe from an global participation maybe from an underrepresented industry, feel free to underrepresented industry, feel free to underrepresented industry, feel free to come uh talk to me. We also have uh a come uh talk to me. We also have uh a come uh talk to me. We also have uh a CNA outreach email. That's CNA CNA outreach email. That's CNA CNA outreach email.
