Kind: captions Language: en Thank you. Um this is CVN more Thank you. Um this is CVN more Thank you. Um this is CVN more implications of removing the technology implications of removing the technology implications of removing the technology requirement within the CV requirement within the CV requirement within the CV rules. Um going to briefly give an rules. Um going to briefly give an rules. Um going to briefly give an overview of who I am and then overview of who I am and then overview of who I am and then differences between the old and new differences between the old and new differences between the old and new rules and then I'm going to have a rules and then I'm going to have a rules and then I'm going to have a guessing game where we're going to guess guessing game where we're going to guess guessing game where we're going to guess whether or not something should get a whether or not something should get a whether or not something should get a CVE under the new rules. Right? and I'll CVE under the new rules. Right? and I'll CVE under the new rules. Right? and I'll ask for a show of hands for ask for a show of hands for ask for a show of hands for that. So, who am I? I am Jonathan Evans, that. So, who am I? I am Jonathan Evans, that. So, who am I? I am Jonathan Evans, a curator on the GitHub advisory a curator on the GitHub advisory a curator on the GitHub advisory database at GitHub. Um, so I publish database at GitHub. Um, so I publish database at GitHub. Um, so I publish advisories advisories advisories um for security issues and I also assign um for security issues and I also assign um for security issues and I also assign CBDs to vulnerabilities within um CBDs to vulnerabilities within um CBDs to vulnerabilities within um repositories at Git on GitHub. Uh before repositories at Git on GitHub. Uh before repositories at Git on GitHub. Uh before that, I was um on the CV team at MITER that, I was um on the CV team at MITER that, I was um on the CV team at MITER for 10 years. Um, so the old rules said that you could Um, so the old rules said that you could Um, so the old rules said that you could only assign CV ID um if the only assign CV ID um if the only assign CV ID um if the vulnerability was not customer vulnerability was not customer vulnerability was not customer controlled if you were the provider of controlled if you were the provider of controlled if you were the provider of that that that service. If you didn't own the the service. If you didn't own the the service. If you didn't own the the service or did the product was not service or did the product was not service or did the product was not customer controlled, then you could not customer controlled, then you could not customer controlled, then you could not assign assign assign CV, right? Couple reasons for this. One CV, right? Couple reasons for this. One CV, right? Couple reasons for this. One is vulnerabilities and services just is vulnerabilities and services just is vulnerabilities and services just generally didn't need um anybody to generally didn't need um anybody to generally didn't need um anybody to actually take an action on it because actually take an action on it because actually take an action on it because the person who owned it already did and the person who owned it already did and the person who owned it already did and fixed it for everybody, right? fixed it for everybody, right? fixed it for everybody, right? The other reason is uh practical that The other reason is uh practical that The other reason is uh practical that MITER used to be the only one who did MITER used to be the only one who did MITER used to be the only one who did all the assignments and when this role all the assignments and when this role all the assignments and when this role was originally created MITER could not was originally created MITER could not was originally created MITER could not tell whether or not the vulnerability tell whether or not the vulnerability tell whether or not the vulnerability was actually the result of the service was actually the result of the service was actually the result of the service or some dependency that service was or some dependency that service was or some dependency that service was using. So they could not say this was using. So they could not say this was using. So they could not say this was actually a new vulnerability. The new rules vulnerability. The new rules vulnerability. The new rules specifically say no technology specifically say no technology specifically say no technology requirements. requirements. requirements. um people wanted to be able to assign TV um people wanted to be able to assign TV um people wanted to be able to assign TV IDs to vulnerabilities in cloud IDs to vulnerabilities in cloud IDs to vulnerabilities in cloud vulnerabilities and AI vulnerabilities. vulnerabilities and AI vulnerabilities. vulnerabilities and AI vulnerabilities. So they were made this change, right? So they were made this change, right? So they were made this change, right? The um new The um new The um new rules specifically emphasize that the rules specifically emphasize that the rules specifically emphasize that the CNA needs to use their own judgment on CNA needs to use their own judgment on CNA needs to use their own judgment on whether or not ACV is appropriate. Right? And then um appropriate. Right? And then um appropriate. Right? And then um according to the rules if there's a according to the rules if there's a according to the rules if there's a vulnerability like thing and there's a vulnerability like thing and there's a vulnerability like thing and there's a consistence a consensus around it then consistence a consensus around it then consistence a consensus around it then that vulnerability like things should that vulnerability like things should that vulnerability like things should get added to the rules. All right. So I'm going to run rules. All right. So I'm going to run rules. All right. So I'm going to run through some scenarios and ask for through some scenarios and ask for through some scenarios and ask for whether or not it should get a whether or not it should get a whether or not it should get a CVE. All right. So a content CVE. All right. So a content CVE. All right. So a content distribution network has a buffer distribution network has a buffer distribution network has a buffer overflow in the code that leaks its overflow in the code that leaks its overflow in the code that leaks its server memory some server memory to its server memory some server memory to its server memory some server memory to its users. Does this get a CV? Show hands. All right. Looks like people hands. All right. Looks like people hands. All right. Looks like people agree. Yep. That's your cloud scenario. agree. Yep. That's your cloud scenario. agree. Yep. That's your cloud scenario. That was a this rule was specifically That was a this rule was specifically That was a this rule was specifically changed so that you could assign a CV ID changed so that you could assign a CV ID changed so that you could assign a CV ID to to to that, right? Attacker is able to bypass that, right? Attacker is able to bypass that, right? Attacker is able to bypass the deep fake protections in AI services. Uh we have mixed opinions services. Uh we have mixed opinions services. Uh we have mixed opinions here. I say no. here. I say no. here. I say no. And uh there is a blog post on AI And uh there is a blog post on AI And uh there is a blog post on AI guidance that um CV recently put out guidance that um CV recently put out guidance that um CV recently put out um talks about um they they specifically um talks about um they they specifically um talks about um they they specifically emphasized this particular rule on emphasized this particular rule on emphasized this particular rule on basically basically basically um there was a rule essentially um there was a rule essentially um there was a rule essentially vulnerability scanners if they miss vulnerability scanners if they miss vulnerability scanners if they miss something like you can't expect them to something like you can't expect them to something like you can't expect them to get everything and this kind of falls get everything and this kind of falls get everything and this kind of falls into that category. Um, Um, Um, right. So, so you're saying uh you're right. So, so you're saying uh you're right. So, so you're saying uh you're asking whether or not um there is a asking whether or not um there is a asking whether or not um there is a consensus against assigning this and um consensus against assigning this and um consensus against assigning this and um I would argue that yes um that is there I would argue that yes um that is there I would argue that yes um that is there is an AI uh working group within the is an AI uh working group within the is an AI uh working group within the CV. Um I believe he chairs it. CV. Um I believe he chairs it. CV. Um I believe he chairs it. Um and yes that that is a developing Um and yes that that is a developing Um and yes that that is a developing consensus I would say right a university's custom student say right a university's custom student say right a university's custom student portal has a SQL injection in it right portal has a SQL injection in it right portal has a SQL injection in it right so their custom website has a SQL so their custom website has a SQL so their custom website has a SQL injection does that get a CVE yeah right yep that gets a CV right CVE yeah right yep that gets a CV right CVE yeah right yep that gets a CV right it's a service like every other one so it's a service like every other one so it's a service like every other one so basically Everybody's websites can now basically Everybody's websites can now basically Everybody's websites can now have CVs which can significantly expand have CVs which can significantly expand have CVs which can significantly expand the number of CVs that could be issued. the number of CVs that could be issued. the number of CVs that could be issued. I don't think re researchers have I don't think re researchers have I don't think re researchers have figured that out yet. Uh a vulnerability in a website um yet. Uh a vulnerability in a website um yet. Uh a vulnerability in a website um caused by a common plugin. Does that get caused by a common plugin. Does that get caused by a common plugin. Does that get a CV? Yeah, that's a CV? Yeah, that's a CV? Yeah, that's traditional. So yeah, we should traditional. So yeah, we should traditional. So yeah, we should get or or you know, maybe not. Maybe if get or or you know, maybe not. Maybe if get or or you know, maybe not. Maybe if I'm a researcher, I'm not going to do I'm a researcher, I'm not going to do I'm a researcher, I'm not going to do that. Maybe I'll just go report the that. Maybe I'll just go report the that. Maybe I'll just go report the vulnerability in every single website vulnerability in every single website vulnerability in every single website that uses the plugin and not tell MITER. And how would MITER know that MITER. And how would MITER know that MITER. And how would MITER know that it's in the plugin and not the it's in the plugin and not the it's in the plugin and not the website? So something to think about, right? Um, resonance of a music about, right? Um, resonance of a music about, right? Um, resonance of a music video causes the device to malfunction. video causes the device to malfunction. video causes the device to malfunction. Should that get a CVE? So, official rules now say that is CVE? So, official rules now say that is CVE? So, official rules now say that is not something that can get a a CVE. Now, not something that can get a a CVE. Now, not something that can get a a CVE. Now, old rules would allow that to actually old rules would allow that to actually old rules would allow that to actually get a CVE, but this officially says get a CVE, but this officially says get a CVE, but this officially says physical attacks should not get physical attacks should not get physical attacks should not get vulnerabilities, you know, unless vulnerabilities, you know, unless vulnerabilities, you know, unless there's a the product specifically says there's a the product specifically says there's a the product specifically says it protects against that, right? So, what about a padlock? that, right? So, what about a padlock? that, right? So, what about a padlock? What if you can bypass it because it has What if you can bypass it because it has What if you can bypass it because it has a weak spring? Should that get a CV? No. So technically it can, right? If they So technically it can, right? If they So technically it can, right? If they make security claims that's they're make security claims that's they're make security claims that's they're protecting you against protecting you against protecting you against access, it can get a CVE. Right? There's that last part on CVE. Right? There's that last part on CVE. Right? There's that last part on there that says unless they make a claim, right? An attacker can claim, right? An attacker can claim, right? An attacker can impersonate the victim in order to port impersonate the victim in order to port impersonate the victim in order to port out the victim's phone number to out the victim's phone number to out the victim's phone number to attacker's phone. Yes. Any nos? All right, we have some notes nos? All right, we have some notes nos? All right, we have some notes there. So, this is actually something there. So, this is actually something there. So, this is actually something like there's nothing that says no. And like there's nothing that says no. And like there's nothing that says no. And there's actually a rule outlet here that there's actually a rule outlet here that there's actually a rule outlet here that says so technical technological and says so technical technological and says so technical technological and other changes over time may be other changes over time may be other changes over time may be considered vulnerabilities. So, this is considered vulnerabilities. So, this is considered vulnerabilities. So, this is a a a maybe. Now, it does say exercise maybe. Now, it does say exercise maybe. Now, it does say exercise judgment, and I might exercise my judgment, and I might exercise my judgment, and I might exercise my judgment and say judgment and say judgment and say no, but it's definitely something that no, but it's definitely something that no, but it's definitely something that can get a can get a can get a CV. Right. What about radio jamming is CV. Right. What about radio jamming is CV. Right. What about radio jamming is used to disable a military drone? Does used to disable a military drone? Does used to disable a military drone? Does that get a that get a that get a CV? Yeses. Raise your hand. No. Nos. No. Nos. No. Nos. No. There's a specific rule that says There's a specific rule that says There's a specific rule that says jamming radio frequency spectrum should jamming radio frequency spectrum should jamming radio frequency spectrum should not get a CV. Uh, apparently that's lumped in with CV. Uh, apparently that's lumped in with CV. Uh, apparently that's lumped in with other brute force attacks which also other brute force attacks which also other brute force attacks which also don't get don't get don't get CVS. All right, what about let's say CVS. All right, what about let's say CVS. All right, what about let's say pickle scan which is designed to pickle scan which is designed to pickle scan which is designed to specifically detect specifically detect specifically detect um, uh, pickle attacks. What if it um, uh, pickle attacks. What if it um, uh, pickle attacks. What if it misses it because um the object using misses it because um the object using misses it because um the object using pip.mate? Does that get a CV? We have some yeses. We have some nos. This one actually got nos. This one actually got nos. This one actually got one. Um so says it should not unless it one. Um so says it should not unless it one. Um so says it should not unless it explicitly claims to detect the pattern explicitly claims to detect the pattern explicitly claims to detect the pattern and fails to do and fails to do and fails to do so. So pickle scan asked for a CVE. So so. So pickle scan asked for a CVE. So so. So pickle scan asked for a CVE. So we gave him one, right? Mistakes in GitHub action one, right? Mistakes in GitHub action one, right? Mistakes in GitHub action scripts leads to secret exposure. These scripts leads to secret exposure. These scripts leads to secret exposure. These are in your are in your are in your CI/CD. They um don't actually touch the CI/CD. They um don't actually touch the CI/CD. They um don't actually touch the actual package, but um yeah, there is an actual package, but um yeah, there is an actual package, but um yeah, there is an actual vulnerability actual vulnerability actual vulnerability um in your CI/CD that will leak your um in your CI/CD that will leak your um in your CI/CD that will leak your secrets. Does that get a secrets. Does that get a secrets. Does that get a CV? CV? CV? Yes. Nos. Yes. Nos. Yes. Nos. All right, it is mixed. This is a All right, it is mixed. This is a All right, it is mixed. This is a yes. Um, this is basically just like a yes. Um, this is basically just like a yes. Um, this is basically just like a service, right? It there's no service, right? It there's no service, right? It there's no technological technological technological requirement. It is very much a sort of requirement. It is very much a sort of requirement. It is very much a sort of gray zone similar to the services. And gray zone similar to the services. And gray zone similar to the services. And so, you know, this can get a CVE, so, you know, this can get a CVE, so, you know, this can get a CVE, which our security lab at GitHub found a which our security lab at GitHub found a which our security lab at GitHub found a bunch of these before the rule change, bunch of these before the rule change, bunch of these before the rule change, so those don't have them. But the new so those don't have them. But the new so those don't have them. But the new ones can. All right. Let's say we have an can. All right. Let's say we have an can. All right. Let's say we have an actual biological based RNA based actual biological based RNA based actual biological based RNA based computer and somebody creates a virus computer and somebody creates a virus computer and somebody creates a virus for that. Can that get a CVE? CVE? CVE? Yeses. We have some yeses. Yeses. We have some yeses. Yeses. We have some yeses. No. We have some nos. Yeah. Maybe Maybe Maybe um so you know if there is a real um so you know if there is a real um so you know if there is a real biological based computer maybe that biological based computer maybe that biological based computer maybe that falls into one of those so technical falls into one of those so technical falls into one of those so technical technological changes that should get a technological changes that should get a technological changes that should get a CV maybe like I'm not sure about that CV maybe like I'm not sure about that CV maybe like I'm not sure about that one on the other hand you could consider one on the other hand you could consider one on the other hand you could consider it a physical physical attack and it a physical physical attack and it a physical physical attack and physical attacks do not get CVS so right let's say there's a tamperproof so right let's say there's a tamperproof so right let's say there's a tamperproof proof seal on a physical Bitcoin that proof seal on a physical Bitcoin that proof seal on a physical Bitcoin that can be bypassed by pressing down the can be bypassed by pressing down the can be bypassed by pressing down the seal and feeling the key. This is seal and feeling the key. This is seal and feeling the key. This is something when I was at MITER I actually something when I was at MITER I actually something when I was at MITER I actually got asked got asked got asked for. So for. So for. So yeses, yeses, yeses, nos. All nos. All nos. All right. Yeah, it's there's tamperproof right. Yeah, it's there's tamperproof right. Yeah, it's there's tamperproof seal, right? They're making claim that seal, right? They're making claim that seal, right? They're making claim that you can't tamper with you can't tamper with you can't tamper with it, right? you bypass the tamper proof it, right? you bypass the tamper proof it, right? you bypass the tamper proof so it it gets a CV. It did not at the so it it gets a CV. It did not at the so it it gets a CV. It did not at the time though. All right. Let's say someone though. All right. Let's say someone though. All right. Let's say someone sees the internet prompts to send PII sees the internet prompts to send PII sees the internet prompts to send PII and any prompt to them um which are then and any prompt to them um which are then and any prompt to them um which are then used in training data in an LLM. So, we have So, we have So, we have our um chair of the AI working group our um chair of the AI working group our um chair of the AI working group saying no, this is not. So, who wants to saying no, this is not. So, who wants to saying no, this is not. So, who wants to say yes? say yes? say yes? Anybody? How about no? Oh, we got one. Anybody? How about no? Oh, we got one. Anybody? How about no? Oh, we got one. Nose. Nose. Nose. Okay. Yeah, I went with no here as well. All right. package has a typo in well. All right. package has a typo in well. All right. package has a typo in the name um it uses for a dependency and the name um it uses for a dependency and the name um it uses for a dependency and the package for that typo is not in the the package for that typo is not in the the package for that typo is not in the name not in that registry. Should that name not in that registry. Should that name not in that registry. Should that get a get a get a CV? We have some CV? We have some CV? We have some yeses. How about nos? Yep, that one get got a CV. That's nos? Yep, that one get got a CV. That's nos? Yep, that one get got a CV. That's a real thing as a real thing as a real thing as well. All right. Using the noises from well. All right. Using the noises from well. All right. Using the noises from hardware to extract the encryption hardware to extract the encryption hardware to extract the encryption key. Yeses, Yeses, Yeses, nos. All right. So, it's mixed. Normally, like this is I would mixed. Normally, like this is I would mixed. Normally, like this is I would consider this a physical attack and no, consider this a physical attack and no, consider this a physical attack and no, but um the software maintainer disagreed but um the software maintainer disagreed but um the software maintainer disagreed and wanted a CV, so we gave it to him. and wanted a CV, so we gave it to him. and wanted a CV, so we gave it to him. Right. A lot of these rules say should Right. A lot of these rules say should Right. A lot of these rules say should and so there's always that exception of and so there's always that exception of and so there's always that exception of you can but you know most of the time you can but you know most of the time you can but you know most of the time you you you shouldn't right quantum computing can shouldn't right quantum computing can shouldn't right quantum computing can now break all of your hash mechanisms now break all of your hash mechanisms now break all of your hash mechanisms and encryption and all that should get CV yeses Uh so the question is is it just the Uh so the question is is it just the Uh so the question is is it just the existence of quantum computing or is it existence of quantum computing or is it existence of quantum computing or is it your application that's using the your application that's using the your application that's using the encryption that can now be broken. Um encryption that can now be broken. Um encryption that can now be broken. Um that is a very good question at which that is a very good question at which that is a very good question at which level you would put it. You could also level you would put it. You could also level you would put it. You could also do it at the encryption um protocol or do it at the encryption um protocol or do it at the encryption um protocol or you know standard level. Um, but it's you know standard level. Um, but it's you know standard level. Um, but it's one of those I I would put it at the one of those I I would put it at the one of those I I would put it at the system level or the the standard level. system level or the the standard level. system level or the the standard level. So, yeses, yeses, yeses, nos. Oh, more nos than yeses. Yeah, that nos. Oh, more nos than yeses. Yeah, that nos. Oh, more nos than yeses. Yeah, that definitely gets a CV. Oh, I know. It It is not good. Yeah. And this is one of the things that Yeah. And this is one of the things that Yeah. And this is one of the things that has is one of those social technical has is one of those social technical has is one of those social technical technological changes that is actually technological changes that is actually technological changes that is actually the main reason why that was that rule the main reason why that was that rule the main reason why that was that rule is in there is because over time a lot is in there is because over time a lot is in there is because over time a lot of these encryptions have been broken of these encryptions have been broken of these encryptions have been broken and um you know at one time they were and um you know at one time they were and um you know at one time they were safe and would not have been considered safe and would not have been considered safe and would not have been considered a vulnerability. Later on they're a vulnerability. Later on they're a vulnerability. Later on they're considered unsafe and are a considered unsafe and are a considered unsafe and are a vulnerability. Right. New car model has a pro a problem Right. New car model has a pro a problem Right. New car model has a pro a problem with the pedal that sometimes sticks and with the pedal that sometimes sticks and with the pedal that sometimes sticks and causes uncontrollable causes uncontrollable causes uncontrollable acceleration. acceleration. acceleration. Yeses. Any Yeses. Any Yeses. Any nos? What? No. This is a safety issue, not a No. This is a safety issue, not a No. This is a safety issue, not a security issue. There's no attacker can security issue. There's no attacker can security issue. There's no attacker can that can cause that. It's just random. Right? Now, if you could, you know, Right? Now, if you could, you know, Right? Now, if you could, you know, present an attack vector where that present an attack vector where that present an attack vector where that happens, right? happens, right? happens, right? If it doesn't matter if it's not If it doesn't matter if it's not If it doesn't matter if it's not controlled by an attacker, right? Right. All elevators of the same right? Right. All elevators of the same right? Right. All elevators of the same model share the same key to bypass their model share the same key to bypass their model share the same key to bypass their floor access restrictions. So, it lets floor access restrictions. So, it lets floor access restrictions. So, it lets you bypass the floor access restrictions you bypass the floor access restrictions you bypass the floor access restrictions to go to whatever floor you want. Yeses. All right. Yes. Yeses. All right. Yes. Yeses. All right. Yes. Nos. All right. So, yep. I would Nos. All right. So, yep. I would Nos. All right. So, yep. I would consider this no. Um, insecure default consider this no. Um, insecure default consider this no. Um, insecure default configurations should be considered but configurations should be considered but configurations should be considered but aren't required. And almost every single aren't required. And almost every single aren't required. And almost every single um place requires that that be that um place requires that that be that um place requires that that be that there be that key. Um, so that emergency there be that key. Um, so that emergency there be that key. Um, so that emergency services can actually get up the floors. All right. And those are the scenarios I All right. And those are the scenarios I All right. And those are the scenarios I wanted to go over. So, um, if you have wanted to go over. So, um, if you have wanted to go over. So, um, if you have concerns about any changes, have any concerns about any changes, have any concerns about any changes, have any ideas on, um, you know, how to improve ideas on, um, you know, how to improve ideas on, um, you know, how to improve the rules, there is a GitHub repo that the rules, there is a GitHub repo that the rules, there is a GitHub repo that you can make comments and suggestions. you can make comments and suggestions. you can make comments and suggestions. Are there any questions? You'll see a Are there any questions? You'll see a Are there any questions? You'll see a theme here. The first question is um has theme here. The first question is um has theme here. The first question is um has GitHub or will GitHub beun begin testing GitHub or will GitHub beun begin testing GitHub or will GitHub beun begin testing physical locks to issue CVEEs against physical locks to issue CVEEs against physical locks to issue CVEEs against them? Uh second question is there or them? Uh second question is there or them? Uh second question is there or will there be a CVE for u bird flu let's will there be a CVE for u bird flu let's will there be a CVE for u bird flu let's say so or perhaps lab generated. And say so or perhaps lab generated. And say so or perhaps lab generated. And thirdly it seems like the new rules thirdly it seems like the new rules thirdly it seems like the new rules could lead to a proliferation of CBEEs could lead to a proliferation of CBEEs could lead to a proliferation of CBEEs about a broad range of topics outside of about a broad range of topics outside of about a broad range of topics outside of the software that we typically look at. the software that we typically look at. the software that we typically look at. Will there be filters around managing Will there be filters around managing Will there be filters around managing who who's looking at what for physical who who's looking at what for physical who who's looking at what for physical locks and bird flu and repos and so on? locks and bird flu and repos and so on? locks and bird flu and repos and so on? Yep. So, uh, GitHub is definitely not Yep. So, uh, GitHub is definitely not Yep. So, uh, GitHub is definitely not going to because we're open source that going to because we're open source that going to because we're open source that that is our scope. Locks would be that is our scope. Locks would be that is our scope. Locks would be outside of our scope. Uh, as far as outside of our scope. Uh, as far as outside of our scope. Uh, as far as burflu thing, burflu thing, burflu thing, um, again that's, you know, burlu is a um, again that's, you know, burlu is a um, again that's, you know, burlu is a physical attack if it is actually physical attack if it is actually physical attack if it is actually created by a human, right? again. created by a human, right? again. created by a human, right? again. Um so I think that might be outside the Um so I think that might be outside the Um so I think that might be outside the scope. Um now is there ways of filtering scope. Um now is there ways of filtering scope. Um now is there ways of filtering things? One of the things that was things? One of the things that was things? One of the things that was implemented for assigning CV ids for um implemented for assigning CV ids for um implemented for assigning CV ids for um cloud services is there is a tag that cloud services is there is a tag that cloud services is there is a tag that you can add to the CV records for um I you can add to the CV records for um I you can add to the CV records for um I think it's something like solely hosted think it's something like solely hosted think it's something like solely hosted service something like that. service something like that. service something like that. um that would allow you to be able to um that would allow you to be able to um that would allow you to be able to filter on that. Uh will there need to be filter on that. Uh will there need to be filter on that. Uh will there need to be fil you know tags for things like fil you know tags for things like fil you know tags for things like hardware possibly if um we see more hardware possibly if um we see more hardware possibly if um we see more adoption of it. So I got two questions. One is how much So I got two questions. One is how much So I got two questions. One is how much of a burden do you think it's going to of a burden do you think it's going to of a burden do you think it's going to put on the CNA last resort um effort? I put on the CNA last resort um effort? I put on the CNA last resort um effort? I think it could kill it. Uh you know this think it could kill it. Uh you know this think it could kill it. Uh you know this is one of the main concerns I had when is one of the main concerns I had when is one of the main concerns I had when the new rules were implemented was that the new rules were implemented was that the new rules were implemented was that uh if you start assigning CV IDs to uh if you start assigning CV IDs to uh if you start assigning CV IDs to vulnerabilities in individual websites vulnerabilities in individual websites vulnerabilities in individual websites that could get MITER flooded and MITER's that could get MITER flooded and MITER's that could get MITER flooded and MITER's not prepared for that and having worked not prepared for that and having worked not prepared for that and having worked at MITER I you know at MITER I you know at MITER I you know uh I was very happy to have that rule in uh I was very happy to have that rule in uh I was very happy to have that rule in there. It was insistent that it be in there. It was insistent that it be in there. It was insistent that it be in there uh so that we wouldn't kill the there uh so that we wouldn't kill the there uh so that we wouldn't kill the system. But now that's there uh I kind system. But now that's there uh I kind system. But now that's there uh I kind of want of want of want to you know raise awareness that there to you know raise awareness that there to you know raise awareness that there is this issue u maybe we want to is this issue u maybe we want to is this issue u maybe we want to preemptively be concerned about it. One preemptively be concerned about it. One preemptively be concerned about it. One of the things I've suggested is that of the things I've suggested is that of the things I've suggested is that MITER create its own policy where it may MITER create its own policy where it may MITER create its own policy where it may scope out that particular issue. you scope out that particular issue. you scope out that particular issue. you know, if some other CNA wants to CNA know, if some other CNA wants to CNA know, if some other CNA wants to CNA last resort wants to take up it, you last resort wants to take up it, you last resort wants to take up it, you know, know, know, uh maybe the board could, you know, uh maybe the board could, you know, uh maybe the board could, you know, allow that to allow that to allow that to happen. The other thing is, um, do you happen. The other thing is, um, do you happen. The other thing is, um, do you think they're going to look at the think they're going to look at the think they're going to look at the standard again and I guess re-qualify standard again and I guess re-qualify standard again and I guess re-qualify what is a physical attack now? Because what is a physical attack now? Because what is a physical attack now? Because like I mean technically electrons and like I mean technically electrons and like I mean technically electrons and stuff are physical. You know, radio stuff are physical. You know, radio stuff are physical. You know, radio waves are physical things. they are, you waves are physical things. they are, you waves are physical things. they are, you know, where do we draw that line of know, where do we draw that line of know, where do we draw that line of what's a physical attack? Now, what's a physical attack? Now, what's a physical attack? Now, uh I think that's where you start using uh I think that's where you start using uh I think that's where you start using your judgment, right? I I think that's your judgment, right? I I think that's your judgment, right? I I think that's part of it. Uh the physical attack rules part of it. Uh the physical attack rules part of it. Uh the physical attack rules uh part of those were intentionally imp uh part of those were intentionally imp uh part of those were intentionally imp put in because put in because put in because uh I think the intel people were very uh I think the intel people were very uh I think the intel people were very upset about some of the physical upset about some of the physical upset about some of the physical attacks. attacks. attacks. Um and like so they put in rules that if Um and like so they put in rules that if Um and like so they put in rules that if you're like intentionally bypassing you you're like intentionally bypassing you you're like intentionally bypassing you know know know uh some securities in the physical uh some securities in the physical uh some securities in the physical packaging then you know it it's not packaging then you know it it's not packaging then you know it it's not considered a vulnerability and things considered a vulnerability and things considered a vulnerability and things like that. So like that. So like that. So yep all right that was tough. Thank you yep all right that was tough. Thank you yep all right that was tough. Thank you everybody for participating. Pitch room.
