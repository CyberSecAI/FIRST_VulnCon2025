Kind: captions Language: en So, just a quick reminder on the speaker So, just a quick reminder on the speaker So, just a quick reminder on the speaker feedback thing. I have the laser. Uh, feedback thing. I have the laser. Uh, feedback thing. I have the laser. Uh, all right. Hi, everyone. I'm Michael all right. Hi, everyone. I'm Michael all right. Hi, everyone. I'm Michael Windsor. Uh, I'm here today to talk to Windsor. Uh, I'm here today to talk to Windsor. Uh, I'm here today to talk to you about uh the past three years of you about uh the past three years of you about uh the past three years of funding security and open source and the funding security and open source and the funding security and open source and the many lessons we've learned in doing it. many lessons we've learned in doing it. many lessons we've learned in doing it. Um, when I prepared this deck, I was Um, when I prepared this deck, I was Um, when I prepared this deck, I was thinking it was a 30-minute talk. Uh the thinking it was a 30-minute talk. Uh the thinking it was a 30-minute talk. Uh the good news is I put in way more slides good news is I put in way more slides good news is I put in way more slides than I had time for even in a three-hour than I had time for even in a three-hour than I had time for even in a three-hour talk. So we're going to we're going to talk. So we're going to we're going to talk. So we're going to we're going to go. Uh I I like an interactive go. Uh I I like an interactive go. Uh I I like an interactive conversation. So if you have something conversation. So if you have something conversation. So if you have something to say while I'm saying it, jump in. to say while I'm saying it, jump in. to say while I'm saying it, jump in. Let's do it. Uh we don't have to wait Let's do it. Uh we don't have to wait Let's do it. Uh we don't have to wait till the end to get to questions. Will till the end to get to questions. Will till the end to get to questions. Will this thing advance? Okay. So Alpha Omega is a advance? Okay. So Alpha Omega is a advance? Okay. So Alpha Omega is a project as part of the Linux Foundation. project as part of the Linux Foundation. project as part of the Linux Foundation. It was uh co-founded by myself and It was uh co-founded by myself and It was uh co-founded by myself and Michael Scaveta who will raise his hand Michael Scaveta who will raise his hand Michael Scaveta who will raise his hand uh by Google and Microsoft at the time uh by Google and Microsoft at the time uh by Google and Microsoft at the time and we have since been joined by Amazon. and we have since been joined by Amazon. and we have since been joined by Amazon. Um and this is our mission. We're here Um and this is our mission. We're here Um and this is our mission. We're here to actually go off and cause change in to actually go off and cause change in to actually go off and cause change in open source ecosystems to make them more open source ecosystems to make them more open source ecosystems to make them more secure. We are not a traditional fund in secure. We are not a traditional fund in secure. We are not a traditional fund in any way, shape or form. We're certainly any way, shape or form. We're certainly any way, shape or form. We're certainly not a traditional Alex Linux Foundation not a traditional Alex Linux Foundation not a traditional Alex Linux Foundation project or foundation either. Um, and project or foundation either. Um, and project or foundation either. Um, and part of how we do things is part of the part of how we do things is part of the part of how we do things is part of the conversation conversation conversation today. I went backwards, that's why I today. I went backwards, that's why I today. I went backwards, that's why I didn't go. Okay. So, when we talk about didn't go. Okay. So, when we talk about didn't go. Okay. So, when we talk about Alpha and Omega, uh, when we first Alpha and Omega, uh, when we first Alpha and Omega, uh, when we first started out, Alpha was looking at the started out, Alpha was looking at the started out, Alpha was looking at the top 100 most critical open source top 100 most critical open source top 100 most critical open source projects. And then we found out that A, projects. And then we found out that A, projects. And then we found out that A, nobody could agree what they were, and nobody could agree what they were, and nobody could agree what they were, and B, most of the obvious ones were getting B, most of the obvious ones were getting B, most of the obvious ones were getting a lot of attention, and C, giving them a lot of attention, and C, giving them a lot of attention, and C, giving them money wasn't going to make them more money wasn't going to make them more money wasn't going to make them more secure. The problems they had were not secure. The problems they had were not secure. The problems they had were not about resources and money. They were about resources and money. They were about resources and money. They were just problems. just problems. just problems. We've evolved that to focusing on points We've evolved that to focusing on points We've evolved that to focusing on points of leverage where we can with judicious of leverage where we can with judicious of leverage where we can with judicious spending cause change, catalyze change, spending cause change, catalyze change, spending cause change, catalyze change, cause leadership to emerge and create cause leadership to emerge and create cause leadership to emerge and create changes that go long past our changes that go long past our changes that go long past our involvement. And that's really the goal. involvement. And that's really the goal. involvement. And that's really the goal. We don't want to be a permanent funding We don't want to be a permanent funding We don't want to be a permanent funding security work to the end of time. security work to the end of time. security work to the end of time. But the other end of the scale, Omega, But the other end of the scale, Omega, But the other end of the scale, Omega, is for the hundreds of thousands of is for the hundreds of thousands of is for the hundreds of thousands of projects that are not just going to move projects that are not just going to move projects that are not just going to move because they're part of some larger because they're part of some larger because they're part of some larger project or foundation or there aren't project or foundation or there aren't project or foundation or there aren't resources to do so. And they still resources to do so. And they still resources to do so. And they still represent risks, opportunities, and represent risks, opportunities, and represent risks, opportunities, and challenges for challenges for challenges for everybody. Since we started, we've everybody. Since we started, we've everybody. Since we started, we've raised about $23 million. Um, and very raised about $23 million. Um, and very raised about $23 million. Um, and very little of it has gone to trips to Fiji. little of it has gone to trips to Fiji. little of it has gone to trips to Fiji. It's one of our running jokes that we're It's one of our running jokes that we're It's one of our running jokes that we're going to have a board meeting in Fiji going to have a board meeting in Fiji going to have a board meeting in Fiji one day, and somehow we never seem to do one day, and somehow we never seem to do one day, and somehow we never seem to do it. uh we have been funded by Google, it. uh we have been funded by Google, it. uh we have been funded by Google, Amazon and Microsoft as I said and most Amazon and Microsoft as I said and most Amazon and Microsoft as I said and most recently city joined us as a general man recently city joined us as a general man recently city joined us as a general man general member as well and thank you general member as well and thank you general member as well and thank you very much to city these are just the very much to city these are just the very much to city these are just the sort of major ecosystems that we have sort of major ecosystems that we have sort of major ecosystems that we have funded uh below funded uh below funded uh below there so we're going to talk first about there so we're going to talk first about there so we're going to talk first about the scaled part of the problem um the scaled part of the problem um the scaled part of the problem um because it's really hard and I'll be because it's really hard and I'll be because it's really hard and I'll be very direct we have not figured it out very direct we have not figured it out very direct we have not figured it out yet we're still poking at it and trying yet we're still poking at it and trying yet we're still poking at it and trying and learning along the And I've likened this to cleaning up the And I've likened this to cleaning up the And I've likened this to cleaning up the Pacific garbage patch. In fact, we have Pacific garbage patch. In fact, we have Pacific garbage patch. In fact, we have funded efforts. I've been a couple of funded efforts. I've been a couple of funded efforts. I've been a couple of other talks where I monoir have other talks where I monoir have other talks where I monoir have mentioned this. We funded some efforts mentioned this. We funded some efforts mentioned this. We funded some efforts to go off and do scaled sort of static to go off and do scaled sort of static to go off and do scaled sort of static analysis of code finding fixing pushing analysis of code finding fixing pushing analysis of code finding fixing pushing out PRs of vulnerabilities in thousands out PRs of vulnerabilities in thousands out PRs of vulnerabilities in thousands of projects. We took the top 2,000 of projects. We took the top 2,000 of projects. We took the top 2,000 projects in Pippi for example and tried projects in Pippi for example and tried projects in Pippi for example and tried that. And then we did more and the that. And then we did more and the that. And then we did more and the result was result was result was like, okay, you know, you did work. The like, okay, you know, you did work. The like, okay, you know, you did work. The cost per project was actually not bad. cost per project was actually not bad. cost per project was actually not bad. So if I had, you know, $20 million to So if I had, you know, $20 million to So if I had, you know, $20 million to burn, maybe I could do that all every burn, maybe I could do that all every burn, maybe I could do that all every year to keep cranking year to keep cranking year to keep cranking away. But it wasn't actionable. And that away. But it wasn't actionable. And that away. But it wasn't actionable. And that was really the hard point. We could do was really the hard point. We could do was really the hard point. We could do this this this work. We could prove that we'd done work. We could prove that we'd done work. We could prove that we'd done something useful and nobody was able to something useful and nobody was able to something useful and nobody was able to do anything else differently. they were do anything else differently. they were do anything else differently. they were not able to take less risk somewhere not able to take less risk somewhere not able to take less risk somewhere else or more risk some there's nothing else or more risk some there's nothing else or more risk some there's nothing they could do about it. It was became they could do about it. It was became they could do about it. It was became clear that you we're going to need a clear that you we're going to need a clear that you we're going to need a bigger boat or a different bigger boat or a different bigger boat or a different approach. We have evolved and earlier on approach. We have evolved and earlier on approach. We have evolved and earlier on Yaric and I gave a talk about this to an Yaric and I gave a talk about this to an Yaric and I gave a talk about this to an approach we call cleaning the beach and approach we call cleaning the beach and approach we call cleaning the beach and that is instead of trying to solve for that is instead of trying to solve for that is instead of trying to solve for the whole Pacific garbage patch, we the whole Pacific garbage patch, we the whole Pacific garbage patch, we actually look at a beach that is a actually look at a beach that is a actually look at a beach that is a community, right? Right? And if you community, right? Right? And if you community, right? Right? And if you think about beaches, right, a town beach think about beaches, right, a town beach think about beaches, right, a town beach or a popular beach, people go there and or a popular beach, people go there and or a popular beach, people go there and they care about it and they make at they care about it and they make at they care about it and they make at least some effort and every now and then least some effort and every now and then least some effort and every now and then maybe the town gets together and has a maybe the town gets together and has a maybe the town gets together and has a beach clean thing or they hire a truck beach clean thing or they hire a truck beach clean thing or they hire a truck to go and do it because everybody wants to go and do it because everybody wants to go and do it because everybody wants to pay their taxes to do that. Either to pay their taxes to do that. Either to pay their taxes to do that. Either way, people want to keep their beach way, people want to keep their beach way, people want to keep their beach clean. It's not the whole shoreline. clean. It's not the whole shoreline. clean. It's not the whole shoreline. It's certainly not the whole ocean, but It's certainly not the whole ocean, but It's certainly not the whole ocean, but if we can do it in a small area, it if we can do it in a small area, it if we can do it in a small area, it actually causes change that sticks. And actually causes change that sticks. And actually causes change that sticks. And so we've done this a few times now where so we've done this a few times now where so we've done this a few times now where we've gone into a project, help them we've gone into a project, help them we've gone into a project, help them identify their supply chain, help them identify their supply chain, help them identify their supply chain, help them come up with methodologies. In many we come up with methodologies. In many we come up with methodologies. In many we just pay them to figure it out and then just pay them to figure it out and then just pay them to figure it out and then they go do it and they start looking they go do it and they start looking they go do it and they start looking upstream and paying attention to upstream and paying attention to upstream and paying attention to upstream. And that is something that upstream. And that is something that upstream. And that is something that doesn't happen as often as you'd like. doesn't happen as often as you'd like. doesn't happen as often as you'd like. Right? The XZ situation taught us Right? The XZ situation taught us Right? The XZ situation taught us something that every single open source something that every single open source something that every single open source project is just as bad as all the project is just as bad as all the project is just as bad as all the corporations who suck their code for corporations who suck their code for corporations who suck their code for free. They use the stuff upstream as if free. They use the stuff upstream as if free. They use the stuff upstream as if it came down on the back of a unicorn it came down on the back of a unicorn it came down on the back of a unicorn with rainbows coming out of every pore, with rainbows coming out of every pore, with rainbows coming out of every pore, right? They don't pay attention to right? They don't pay attention to right? They don't pay attention to upstream. And what's happening now in upstream. And what's happening now in upstream. And what's happening now in Airflow and in other projects is they're Airflow and in other projects is they're Airflow and in other projects is they're starting to look upstream and to spend starting to look upstream and to spend starting to look upstream and to spend money, time, and effort fixing the code money, time, and effort fixing the code money, time, and effort fixing the code that they use. that they use. that they use. So now I'm going to switch gears a bit So now I'm going to switch gears a bit So now I'm going to switch gears a bit and talk about the various and talk about the various and talk about the various transformations that we've done and how transformations that we've done and how transformations that we've done and how we have caused ecosystems to start we have caused ecosystems to start we have caused ecosystems to start shifting their focus and becoming more shifting their focus and becoming more shifting their focus and becoming more secure. Uh this talk is almost in random secure. Uh this talk is almost in random secure. Uh this talk is almost in random order. I could have mixed these slides order. I could have mixed these slides order. I could have mixed these slides up and maybe one day I will. One of the up and maybe one day I will. One of the up and maybe one day I will. One of the first things we did was pay uh to money first things we did was pay uh to money first things we did was pay uh to money to the Python Software Foundation to to the Python Software Foundation to to the Python Software Foundation to hire a security engineer in residence hire a security engineer in residence hire a security engineer in residence and then we gave money to the Eclipse and then we gave money to the Eclipse and then we gave money to the Eclipse Foundation to hire a security team to Foundation to hire a security team to Foundation to hire a security team to focus on security across the entire focus on security across the entire focus on security across the entire Eclipse Foundation's portfolio of Eclipse Foundation's portfolio of Eclipse Foundation's portfolio of projects. We're making it someone else's projects. We're making it someone else's projects. We're making it someone else's job. job. job. But those were like obvious we can start But those were like obvious we can start But those were like obvious we can start their places for an awful lot of their places for an awful lot of their places for an awful lot of projects that come to us. We start with projects that come to us. We start with projects that come to us. We start with an an an audit. We really like to start with an audit. We really like to start with an audit. We really like to start with an audit. When you do an audit. When you do an audit. When you do an audit, the obvious thing is you find out audit, the obvious thing is you find out audit, the obvious thing is you find out all the problems in the code. And I say all the problems in the code. And I say all the problems in the code. And I say all and I'm laughing now because of all and I'm laughing now because of all and I'm laughing now because of course you don't. You spend lots of course you don't. You spend lots of course you don't. You spend lots of money having some engineers look at it money having some engineers look at it money having some engineers look at it and find some of the more obvious and find some of the more obvious and find some of the more obvious problems that are looking in the code problems that are looking in the code problems that are looking in the code and maybe some of the less obvious ones. and maybe some of the less obvious ones. and maybe some of the less obvious ones. And depending upon how much money you And depending upon how much money you And depending upon how much money you spend, you may find four things. spend, you may find four things. spend, you may find four things. But even before that, the project's But even before that, the project's But even before that, the project's willingness and interest in having that willingness and interest in having that willingness and interest in having that audit happen tells you everything you audit happen tells you everything you audit happen tells you everything you need to know about the security posture need to know about the security posture need to know about the security posture of that of that of that project. And this is one of the the project. And this is one of the the project. And this is one of the the fallacies that we're drinking fallacies that we're drinking fallacies that we're drinking everywhere, right? Is people look at everywhere, right? Is people look at everywhere, right? Is people look at things, they worry about how many things, they worry about how many things, they worry about how many vulnerabilities and there are laws now vulnerabilities and there are laws now vulnerabilities and there are laws now about or regulations about zero vents, about or regulations about zero vents, about or regulations about zero vents, not thou shalt not release with any not thou shalt not release with any not thou shalt not release with any vulnerabilities or no involves. That's vulnerabilities or no involves. That's vulnerabilities or no involves. That's not the problem. The problem is the not the problem. The problem is the not the problem. The problem is the process of the culture of the process of the culture of the process of the culture of the organizations fixing those vuls. So organizations fixing those vuls. So organizations fixing those vuls. So starting with an audit is a great way starting with an audit is a great way starting with an audit is a great way for us to test things and we are for us to test things and we are for us to test things and we are increasingly interested in and the increasingly interested in and the increasingly interested in and the Eclipse Foundation has been leading the Eclipse Foundation has been leading the Eclipse Foundation has been leading the way here way here way here maybe to reduce the cost of these audits maybe to reduce the cost of these audits maybe to reduce the cost of these audits to get that early signal to do the to get that early signal to do the to get that early signal to do the minimal audit to see if that can cause minimal audit to see if that can cause minimal audit to see if that can cause them to do anything and if it changes them to do anything and if it changes them to do anything and if it changes any behavior at all if it doesn't you any behavior at all if it doesn't you any behavior at all if it doesn't you have a much bigger problem and a deep have a much bigger problem and a deep have a much bigger problem and a deep audit won't help audit won't help audit won't help that. So going back to the that. So going back to the that. So going back to the staffing at the Python Software staffing at the Python Software staffing at the Python Software Foundation, it wasn't like nobody cared Foundation, it wasn't like nobody cared Foundation, it wasn't like nobody cared about security in Python. There were about security in Python. There were about security in Python. There were security mailing lists. There were security mailing lists. There were security mailing lists. There were issues. There's a backlog of things. issues. There's a backlog of things. issues. There's a backlog of things. Everybody knew about the problems. But Everybody knew about the problems. But Everybody knew about the problems. But when security is everybody's job, it's when security is everybody's job, it's when security is everybody's job, it's no one's job. And the mere act of making no one's job. And the mere act of making no one's job. And the mere act of making it someone's job. These slides are going it someone's job. These slides are going it someone's job. These slides are going to be available. There's a QR link at to be available. There's a QR link at to be available. There's a QR link at the end. You can take the whole deck and the end. You can take the whole deck and the end. You can take the whole deck and reuse it anytime you want. Um, and so by reuse it anytime you want. Um, and so by reuse it anytime you want. Um, and so by having an amazing person named Seth having an amazing person named Seth having an amazing person named Seth Larson show up and become the security Larson show up and become the security Larson show up and become the security engineering residence, all kinds of engineering residence, all kinds of engineering residence, all kinds of questions went from being committee questions went from being committee questions went from being committee conversations and dialogues and debates conversations and dialogues and debates conversations and dialogues and debates where no one was really teed up to do where no one was really teed up to do where no one was really teed up to do the work to being that's Seth's job. And the work to being that's Seth's job. And the work to being that's Seth's job. And Seth then delegated other people, he Seth then delegated other people, he Seth then delegated other people, he wrote some documents, told people to do wrote some documents, told people to do wrote some documents, told people to do this and created order where there was this and created order where there was this and created order where there was chaos. And if you go now and look at the chaos. And if you go now and look at the chaos. And if you go now and look at the past couple of years of just these past couple of years of just these past couple of years of just these staggering amount of design documents staggering amount of design documents staggering amount of design documents and initiatives and programs and efforts and initiatives and programs and efforts and initiatives and programs and efforts that happen inside Python u because of that happen inside Python u because of that happen inside Python u because of what Seth did, right? It's amazing and what Seth did, right? It's amazing and what Seth did, right? It's amazing and we love that pattern. When we fund those we love that pattern. When we fund those we love that pattern. When we fund those roles, we're very careful not to be roles, we're very careful not to be roles, we're very careful not to be pulling the rug out from under them. So, pulling the rug out from under them. So, pulling the rug out from under them. So, as I mentioned, we don't want to be a as I mentioned, we don't want to be a as I mentioned, we don't want to be a durable, enduring fund and having to pay durable, enduring fund and having to pay durable, enduring fund and having to pay the end of time. It's hard. We keep the end of time. It's hard. We keep the end of time. It's hard. We keep money in reserves so that we give our money in reserves so that we give our money in reserves so that we give our sort of staffing roles at least a year's sort of staffing roles at least a year's sort of staffing roles at least a year's notice if we run out of money because we notice if we run out of money because we notice if we run out of money because we are just hand-to-mouth from our donors are just hand-to-mouth from our donors are just hand-to-mouth from our donors as much as anybody as much as anybody as much as anybody else's. Um, this picture is meant to else's. Um, this picture is meant to else's. Um, this picture is meant to illustrate that everybody else is illustrate that everybody else is illustrate that everybody else is working on really cool growth oriented working on really cool growth oriented working on really cool growth oriented features and the security backlog features and the security backlog features and the security backlog remains remains remains untouched. untouched. untouched. So a key thing is Seth doesn't do all So a key thing is Seth doesn't do all So a key thing is Seth doesn't do all the the the work, right? A security role is about work, right? A security role is about work, right? A security role is about creating a place where security becomes creating a place where security becomes creating a place where security becomes normal, becomes easy to do, becomes a normal, becomes easy to do, becomes a normal, becomes easy to do, becomes a priority, and that there are priority, and that there are priority, and that there are opinionated, reasoned approaches to opinionated, reasoned approaches to opinionated, reasoned approaches to doing that. It sounds like a lot. It is, doing that. It sounds like a lot. It is, doing that. It sounds like a lot. It is, but when you make it someone's job, it but when you make it someone's job, it but when you make it someone's job, it happens. happens. happens. Uh and again you know I can now point to Uh and again you know I can now point to Uh and again you know I can now point to uh Eclipse, uh Eclipse, uh Eclipse, Apache, um Ruby, Rust, Apache, um Ruby, Rust, Apache, um Ruby, Rust, Python, Node.js and OpenJS all have Python, Node.js and OpenJS all have Python, Node.js and OpenJS all have staffing roles focused on security staffing roles focused on security staffing roles focused on security outcomes uh driving real outcomes uh driving real outcomes uh driving real change. I'll come back to how that has change. I'll come back to how that has change. I'll come back to how that has got some sustainability challenges in it got some sustainability challenges in it got some sustainability challenges in it as well. But the key lesson from here, as well. But the key lesson from here, as well. But the key lesson from here, right, is that when you're thinking right, is that when you're thinking right, is that when you're thinking about security, whether it's an open about security, whether it's an open about security, whether it's an open source or your own, right, the current source or your own, right, the current source or your own, right, the current set of vulnerabilities you have doesn't set of vulnerabilities you have doesn't set of vulnerabilities you have doesn't matter for right? The processes matter for right? The processes matter for right? The processes you have are more important than that. you have are more important than that. you have are more important than that. If you have processes that are working If you have processes that are working If you have processes that are working well and fixing them, great. If you well and fixing them, great. If you well and fixing them, great. If you don't have a culture, if it doesn't don't have a culture, if it doesn't don't have a culture, if it doesn't matter, and you don't have the right matter, and you don't have the right matter, and you don't have the right people, you're just you're dead in the people, you're just you're dead in the people, you're just you're dead in the water. You could do all the things, you water. You could do all the things, you water. You could do all the things, you could mandate them. And that's true in could mandate them. And that's true in could mandate them. And that's true in every business, no matter it's open every business, no matter it's open every business, no matter it's open source or for-profit or nonprofit, source or for-profit or nonprofit, source or for-profit or nonprofit, doesn't matter because everybody has a doesn't matter because everybody has a doesn't matter because everybody has a set of priorities that they've already set of priorities that they've already set of priorities that they've already inherited. The business got to where it inherited. The business got to where it inherited. The business got to where it is for various reasons. And none of them is for various reasons. And none of them is for various reasons. And none of them were for its own internal security. Even were for its own internal security. Even were for its own internal security. Even if you're a security business selling if you're a security business selling if you're a security business selling security as a software product, your security as a software product, your security as a software product, your priorities are growth of your business, priorities are growth of your business, priorities are growth of your business, not your own security. It becomes a not your own security. It becomes a not your own security. It becomes a tension inside the tension inside the tension inside the business. So let's talk about how we business. So let's talk about how we business. So let's talk about how we turn money into security. What are the turn money into security. What are the turn money into security. What are the things that we have done? How do we what things that we have done? How do we what things that we have done? How do we what what things we feel have worked well for what things we feel have worked well for what things we feel have worked well for us? We are very biased towards shovel us? We are very biased towards shovel us? We are very biased towards shovel ready work. When someone comes to us ready work. When someone comes to us ready work. When someone comes to us with a proposal and we like, oh, that's with a proposal and we like, oh, that's with a proposal and we like, oh, that's a great proposal. We do it. We're a great proposal. We do it. We're a great proposal. We do it. We're like, we're ready to fund it. Like, like, we're ready to fund it. Like, like, we're ready to fund it. Like, great, give us the money. Like, do you great, give us the money. Like, do you great, give us the money. Like, do you have the person who's going to do the have the person who's going to do the have the person who's going to do the work? Uh, no. We're going to look for work? Uh, no. We're going to look for work? Uh, no. We're going to look for one. Great. Go look for them. We'll talk one. Great. Go look for them. We'll talk one. Great. Go look for them. We'll talk about the money when you have the about the money when you have the about the money when you have the person. Do you know what the work is person. Do you know what the work is person. Do you know what the work is going to be? How they're going to do it? going to be? How they're going to do it? going to be? How they're going to do it? No. We're going to have them design that No. We're going to have them design that No. We're going to have them design that for us. Great. come back when you have a for us. Great. come back when you have a for us. Great. come back when you have a plan, right? We're not a research plan, right? We're not a research plan, right? We're not a research organization. If they think of a organization. If they think of a organization. If they think of a spectrum from like papers to products, spectrum from like papers to products, spectrum from like papers to products, we're pretty biased over here and we're pretty biased over here and we're pretty biased over here and solutionoriented think that and also solutionoriented think that and also solutionoriented think that and also short-term impact, right? So, the short-term impact, right? So, the short-term impact, right? So, the staffing roles represent the long-term. staffing roles represent the long-term. staffing roles represent the long-term. You're here to just keep doing things. You're here to just keep doing things. You're here to just keep doing things. And guess what? They self-organize and And guess what? They self-organize and And guess what? They self-organize and do things that have quarter byquarter do things that have quarter byquarter do things that have quarter byquarter impact. So, they can explain why their impact. So, they can explain why their impact. So, they can explain why their job is worth it. when we're funding a job is worth it. when we're funding a job is worth it. when we're funding a specific initiative or project, if specific initiative or project, if specific initiative or project, if somebody comes to us with something, somebody comes to us with something, somebody comes to us with something, say, "It's going to take about a year to say, "It's going to take about a year to say, "It's going to take about a year to build this piece that then is a thing build this piece that then is a thing build this piece that then is a thing that does a thing and then we'll get it that does a thing and then we'll get it that does a thing and then we'll get it to market." Like, no, that's not our not to market." Like, no, that's not our not to market." Like, no, that's not our not our cup of tea, right? We like to be our cup of tea, right? We like to be our cup of tea, right? We like to be able to come back quarter after quarter able to come back quarter after quarter able to come back quarter after quarter and talk about intermediate results, and talk about intermediate results, and talk about intermediate results, meaningful outcomes and build on them. We are again also very biased them. We are again also very biased them. We are again also very biased towards creating public good. We do work towards creating public good. We do work towards creating public good. We do work with commercial entities sometimes as with commercial entities sometimes as with commercial entities sometimes as vendors to work on open source projects. vendors to work on open source projects. vendors to work on open source projects. We have entertained conversations from We have entertained conversations from We have entertained conversations from commercial entities that have an open- commercial entities that have an open- commercial entities that have an open- source and private component and there source and private component and there source and private component and there are all kinds of gray areas in there. are all kinds of gray areas in there. are all kinds of gray areas in there. But by default, if what you're doing But by default, if what you're doing But by default, if what you're doing isn't obviously for a public open-source isn't obviously for a public open-source isn't obviously for a public open-source collective good, we're going to take a collective good, we're going to take a collective good, we're going to take a more jaist eye to it. Governance more jaist eye to it. Governance more jaist eye to it. Governance matters. Community engagement matters. matters. Community engagement matters. matters. Community engagement matters. Uh you know, I don't want to name any Uh you know, I don't want to name any Uh you know, I don't want to name any names. It was some project that names. It was some project that names. It was some project that approached us for a grant this year and approached us for a grant this year and approached us for a grant this year and it's a company that's got some software it's a company that's got some software it's a company that's got some software that does a thing. I don't even need to that does a thing. I don't even need to that does a thing. I don't even need to say what it was and they've open source say what it was and they've open source say what it was and they've open source the software like many companies do and the software like many companies do and the software like many companies do and they asked us to help fund improvements they asked us to help fund improvements they asked us to help fund improvements to the security of their product. That to the security of their product. That to the security of their product. That opensource product has exactly one opensource product has exactly one opensource product has exactly one organization contributing to it which is organization contributing to it which is organization contributing to it which is the business is profiting from that the business is profiting from that the business is profiting from that software. Hell no. That is not a pattern software. Hell no. That is not a pattern software. Hell no. That is not a pattern for us. Um, but we have uh I think one for us. Um, but we have uh I think one for us. Um, but we have uh I think one of my favorite examples actually is a a of my favorite examples actually is a a of my favorite examples actually is a a small little ecosystem that has found a small little ecosystem that has found a small little ecosystem that has found a real balance between commercial and real balance between commercial and real balance between commercial and public good benefits. So in PHP there's public good benefits. So in PHP there's public good benefits. So in PHP there's a packaging system called packagist. If a packaging system called packagist. If a packaging system called packagist. If you use PHP you probably use you use PHP you probably use you use PHP you probably use packages.org. There is packages.com as packages.org. There is packages.com as packages.org. There is packages.com as well. And packages.com can be used by well. And packages.com can be used by well. And packages.com can be used by enterprises to run their own private enterprises to run their own private enterprises to run their own private repositories and there's a general repositories and there's a general repositories and there's a general public one as part of a commercial public one as part of a commercial public one as part of a commercial entity as well. That team is a team of entity as well. That team is a team of entity as well. That team is a team of about six or seven people living in about six or seven people living in about six or seven people living in Germany. They're making a living. Germany. They're making a living. Germany. They're making a living. They're not making a, you know, money They're not making a, you know, money They're not making a, you know, money hand over fist. They contribute fairly hand over fist. They contribute fairly hand over fist. They contribute fairly equally to the open source good. They equally to the open source good. They equally to the open source good. They keep these code bases well aligned. keep these code bases well aligned. keep these code bases well aligned. There's not a dramatic difference. And There's not a dramatic difference. And There's not a dramatic difference. And so when they approached us, we had a so when they approached us, we had a so when they approached us, we had a conversation about doing an audit to conversation about doing an audit to conversation about doing an audit to improve it. They committed to spending improve it. They committed to spending improve it. They committed to spending their engineering resources to fixing their engineering resources to fixing their engineering resources to fixing all the problems sustainably. And we're all the problems sustainably. And we're all the problems sustainably. And we're like, great, we'll do an audit and see like, great, we'll do an audit and see like, great, we'll do an audit and see how that goes. It was fantastic. Worked how that goes. It was fantastic. Worked how that goes. It was fantastic. Worked really well. And and they've found that really well. And and they've found that really well. And and they've found that balance. balance. balance. As I said before, we really look for As I said before, we really look for As I said before, we really look for leverage. We're not in it to keep leverage. We're not in it to keep leverage. We're not in it to keep funding something forever and ever funding something forever and ever funding something forever and ever that's just a bottomless pit of work that's just a bottomless pit of work that's just a bottomless pit of work until the end of time. We're looking for until the end of time. We're looking for until the end of time. We're looking for things that then cause change that have things that then cause change that have things that then cause change that have impact beyond one person, one project, impact beyond one person, one project, impact beyond one person, one project, one thing. Uh I think a fine example of one thing. Uh I think a fine example of one thing. Uh I think a fine example of this is funding that we did for a this is funding that we did for a this is funding that we did for a project with homebrew. Uh so if you use project with homebrew. Uh so if you use project with homebrew. Uh so if you use almost any computer these days, you almost any computer these days, you almost any computer these days, you probably use brew install something. If probably use brew install something. If probably use brew install something. If you use GitHub actions, by default, brew you use GitHub actions, by default, brew you use GitHub actions, by default, brew is there available for you to pull tools is there available for you to pull tools is there available for you to pull tools in as well to your environment. in as well to your environment. in as well to your environment. Um, so Homebrew now has implemented six Um, so Homebrew now has implemented six Um, so Homebrew now has implemented six store at endtoend verification from the store at endtoend verification from the store at endtoend verification from the build side all the way down to the brew build side all the way down to the brew build side all the way down to the brew client to verify those atestations and client to verify those atestations and client to verify those atestations and the build process. It's pretty awesome the build process. It's pretty awesome the build process. It's pretty awesome for us. that is connecting an entire for us. that is connecting an entire for us. that is connecting an entire ecosystem of people who use brew and ecosystem of people who use brew and ecosystem of people who use brew and bootstrapping six door to help prove bootstrapping six door to help prove bootstrapping six door to help prove endto-end viability of what six door endto-end viability of what six door endto-end viability of what six door does. I'm not going to go into the does. I'm not going to go into the does. I'm not going to go into the weeds, but it's a signing me mechanism weeds, but it's a signing me mechanism weeds, but it's a signing me mechanism to help again predict tamper protection to help again predict tamper protection to help again predict tamper protection and authenticity across the build and authenticity across the build and authenticity across the build process and other forms. And you know process and other forms. And you know process and other forms. And you know it's in beta now. It's not in in it's in beta now. It's not in in it's in beta now. It's not in in production because GitHub has some production because GitHub has some production because GitHub has some issues like they're using OIDC and some issues like they're using OIDC and some issues like they're using OIDC and some limitations and service accounts blah limitations and service accounts blah limitations and service accounts blah blah blah blah blah. But it is doing end blah blah blah blah. But it is doing end blah blah blah blah. But it is doing end to end. That is the kind of leverage. to end. That is the kind of leverage. to end. That is the kind of leverage. Everybody who's using Brew will benefit Everybody who's using Brew will benefit Everybody who's using Brew will benefit from this. Six store benefits from it. from this. Six store benefits from it. from this. Six store benefits from it. The homebrew ecosystem benefits from it. The homebrew ecosystem benefits from it. The homebrew ecosystem benefits from it. And yeah, there's an organization behind And yeah, there's an organization behind And yeah, there's an organization behind there trying to create a for-profit there trying to create a for-profit there trying to create a for-profit entity around Brew. God bless them. Go entity around Brew. God bless them. Go entity around Brew. God bless them. Go for it. Have a great time. The Brew for it. Have a great time. The Brew for it. Have a great time. The Brew ecosystem is winning here. We are very here. We are very here. We are very hands-off. When we pay somebody to do hands-off. When we pay somebody to do hands-off. When we pay somebody to do some work or when a grant comes to us some work or when a grant comes to us some work or when a grant comes to us and we talk to them, whether it's a and we talk to them, whether it's a and we talk to them, whether it's a for-profit or it doesn't matter, right? for-profit or it doesn't matter, right? for-profit or it doesn't matter, right? One of the first things I explain to One of the first things I explain to One of the first things I explain to them them them is there will be some lawyers is there will be some lawyers is there will be some lawyers coming in with a contract about the coming in with a contract about the coming in with a contract about the grant from the Linux Foundation because grant from the Linux Foundation because grant from the Linux Foundation because lawyers got a lawyer and it has terms lawyers got a lawyer and it has terms lawyers got a lawyer and it has terms and there'll be a statement of work and and there'll be a statement of work and and there'll be a statement of work and it is about as enforceable as you think it is about as enforceable as you think it is about as enforceable as you think it is. Not at all. We're going to give it is. Not at all. We're going to give it is. Not at all. We're going to give you money. You're going to do work and you money. You're going to do work and you money. You're going to do work and the first rule is make us want to do it the first rule is make us want to do it the first rule is make us want to do it again. And if after the end of the job again. And if after the end of the job again. And if after the end of the job it's all done and we look at we're like it's all done and we look at we're like it's all done and we look at we're like me. Then when you come back for more me. Then when you come back for more me. Then when you come back for more money you're going to go me. And if you money you're going to go me. And if you money you're going to go me. And if you come back to us and say, "Look at all come back to us and say, "Look at all come back to us and say, "Look at all these great things you did." And we see these great things you did." And we see these great things you did." And we see the difference, we're like, "Hell, we're the difference, we're like, "Hell, we're the difference, we're like, "Hell, we're going to fund you again. How can we do going to fund you again. How can we do going to fund you again. How can we do more? How can we double up?" Right? And more? How can we double up?" Right? And more? How can we double up?" Right? And that works incredibly that works incredibly that works incredibly well. The holding hands part is even well. The holding hands part is even well. The holding hands part is even from the moment the grant starts, the from the moment the grant starts, the from the moment the grant starts, the application starts, we're not like a application starts, we're not like a application starts, we're not like a normal grant organization, too, where normal grant organization, too, where normal grant organization, too, where you have a grant season and there's an you have a grant season and there's an you have a grant season and there's an opaque wall and you send things over and opaque wall and you send things over and opaque wall and you send things over and there's a jury of people. I'll tell you there's a jury of people. I'll tell you there's a jury of people. I'll tell you how it works. You talk to me. Like how it works. You talk to me. Like how it works. You talk to me. Like literally, you talk to me. There's an literally, you talk to me. There's an literally, you talk to me. There's an initial like you send a proposal and initial like you send a proposal and initial like you send a proposal and some of the things like for gardening some of the things like for gardening some of the things like for gardening refurb somewhere in England like no refurb somewhere in England like no refurb somewhere in England like no thank you and then we set up a meeting thank you and then we set up a meeting thank you and then we set up a meeting and I talk to you about your project and and I talk to you about your project and and I talk to you about your project and I help you shape it to fit our agenda I help you shape it to fit our agenda I help you shape it to fit our agenda and to also build on our experience of and to also build on our experience of and to also build on our experience of what works both with our needs but also what works both with our needs but also what works both with our needs but also with the ecosystem as a whole with the ecosystem as a whole with the ecosystem as a whole and that is a collaborative process that and that is a collaborative process that and that is a collaborative process that keeps going and then once the work keeps going and then once the work keeps going and then once the work starts we keep you connected into our starts we keep you connected into our starts we keep you connected into our world we chat we know what's going on world we chat we know what's going on world we chat we know what's going on all these other projects and we see real all these other projects and we see real all these other projects and we see real benefits which leads to the other benefits which leads to the other benefits which leads to the other amazing outcome amazing outcome amazing outcome and and and process by virtue of our position where process by virtue of our position where process by virtue of our position where we're funding across all these different we're funding across all these different we're funding across all these different ecosystems. We're able to connect them ecosystems. We're able to connect them ecosystems. We're able to connect them in ways that they previously were not in ways that they previously were not in ways that they previously were not really connected. And so now we've got really connected. And so now we've got really connected. And so now we've got folks from Python, Pippi, Ruby, Ruby folks from Python, Pippi, Ruby, Ruby folks from Python, Pippi, Ruby, Ruby Gems, Rust, Crates, Gems, Rust, Crates, Gems, Rust, Crates, Eclipse talking to each other, learning Eclipse talking to each other, learning Eclipse talking to each other, learning from each other, leading. And so the from each other, leading. And so the from each other, leading. And so the trusted publishing specification that trusted publishing specification that trusted publishing specification that became a critical part of Pippi's became a critical part of Pippi's became a critical part of Pippi's publishing security is being adopted now publishing security is being adopted now publishing security is being adopted now by Rust and by Ruby gems and other by Rust and by Ruby gems and other by Rust and by Ruby gems and other package ecosystems because there's trust package ecosystems because there's trust package ecosystems because there's trust and we hold a quarterly round table two and we hold a quarterly round table two and we hold a quarterly round table two in person two virtually and we get in person two virtually and we get in person two virtually and we get together in a room not much smaller than together in a room not much smaller than together in a room not much smaller than this and we talk about stuff whatever this and we talk about stuff whatever this and we talk about stuff whatever happens to be on our mind and we talk happens to be on our mind and we talk happens to be on our mind and we talk about trusted publishing we talk about about trusted publishing we talk about about trusted publishing we talk about end of life situations and it's amazing end of life situations and it's amazing end of life situations and it's amazing and that community chats as Oh. Uh, and and that community chats as Oh. Uh, and and that community chats as Oh. Uh, and it's just it's literally just our it's just it's literally just our it's just it's literally just our friends and family. It's people we've friends and family. It's people we've friends and family. It's people we've had to work with. Sometimes we haven't had to work with. Sometimes we haven't had to work with. Sometimes we haven't even funded them. We're like, "You even funded them. We're like, "You even funded them. We're like, "You should come into the conversation. You'd should come into the conversation. You'd should come into the conversation. You'd be be be great." great." great." So, we spend money, but at the end of So, we spend money, but at the end of So, we spend money, but at the end of the day, this is what the day, this is what the day, this is what wins. And so, projects that are going to wins. And so, projects that are going to wins. And so, projects that are going to farewell are ones where there are farewell are ones where there are farewell are ones where there are already engineering resources. There is already engineering resources. There is already engineering resources. There is already a community around it that can already a community around it that can already a community around it that can be galvanized, can be pointed in the be galvanized, can be pointed in the be galvanized, can be pointed in the right direction. right direction. right direction. And our money doesn't last, but that And our money doesn't last, but that And our money doesn't last, but that stuff does. It creates real mass and stuff does. It creates real mass and stuff does. It creates real mass and real momentum of change. And so that real momentum of change. And so that real momentum of change. And so that again is what we look for in a an again is what we look for in a an again is what we look for in a an investment and an investment and an investment and an outcome. So now we come to the really outcome. So now we come to the really outcome. So now we come to the really ugly stuff. Let's talk about the ugly stuff. Let's talk about the ugly stuff. Let's talk about the economics of open source and open source economics of open source and open source economics of open source and open source security. Uh I don't have pretty security. Uh I don't have pretty security. Uh I don't have pretty pictures for here because it's not a pictures for here because it's not a pictures for here because it's not a pretty picture. There's really nothing pretty picture. There's really nothing pretty picture. There's really nothing good about this situation. good about this situation. good about this situation. So most of open source funding today is So most of open source funding today is So most of open source funding today is ospos that sort of doing some sort of ospos that sort of doing some sort of ospos that sort of doing some sort of weird combination of marketing, a little weird combination of marketing, a little weird combination of marketing, a little bit of desperation. We should make sure bit of desperation. We should make sure bit of desperation. We should make sure these guys don't die tomorrow. And it's these guys don't die tomorrow. And it's these guys don't die tomorrow. And it's just not wired for software engineering. just not wired for software engineering. just not wired for software engineering. Most open source foundations are not Most open source foundations are not Most open source foundations are not software software software shops. Their events, their shops. Their events, their shops. Their events, their community, their community, their community, their legal, some of that. legal, some of that. legal, some of that. Um, and when they try to be, it doesn't Um, and when they try to be, it doesn't Um, and when they try to be, it doesn't work very well, does it Jonathan? We actually tried hiring Jonathan? We actually tried hiring Jonathan? We actually tried hiring people, including Jonathan, to work on people, including Jonathan, to work on people, including Jonathan, to work on some stuff. And one of the things we some stuff. And one of the things we some stuff. And one of the things we learned is that we specifically are learned is that we specifically are learned is that we specifically are not a software organization. We're a not a software organization. We're a not a software organization. We're a fund. We're a very specific kind of fund. We're a very specific kind of fund. We're a very specific kind of fund. We focus on our outcomes. We stay fund. We focus on our outcomes. We stay fund. We focus on our outcomes. We stay very lean. But the problem beyond very lean. But the problem beyond very lean. But the problem beyond Jonathan's Jonathan's Jonathan's travailes, right, is that there are not travailes, right, is that there are not travailes, right, is that there are not very many places that very many places that very many places that are software foundations that do are software foundations that do are software foundations that do software engineering, right? The real software engineering, right? The real software engineering, right? The real engineering input comes from nights and engineering input comes from nights and engineering input comes from nights and weekends volunteers, passionate people, weekends volunteers, passionate people, weekends volunteers, passionate people, and engineers working at corporations and engineers working at corporations and engineers working at corporations who have found it in their best interest who have found it in their best interest who have found it in their best interest to contribute to a project. to contribute to a project. to contribute to a project. And there are gaps there that are not And there are gaps there that are not And there are gaps there that are not well covered, right? And and figuring well covered, right? And and figuring well covered, right? And and figuring that out, right? It's not by getting that out, right? It's not by getting that out, right? It's not by getting more nights and weekends out of people more nights and weekends out of people more nights and weekends out of people that we're going to solve this problem, that we're going to solve this problem, that we're going to solve this problem, right? It's by getting more corporations right? It's by getting more corporations right? It's by getting more corporations to look upstream and realize that it is to look upstream and realize that it is to look upstream and realize that it is in their best interest to do something in their best interest to do something in their best interest to do something about about about this. So, you can't fund more nights and this. So, you can't fund more nights and this. So, you can't fund more nights and weekends. There are a lot of reasons. weekends. There are a lot of reasons. weekends. There are a lot of reasons. Let's say there's a fine individual Let's say there's a fine individual Let's say there's a fine individual who's doing great work, right? We love who's doing great work, right? We love who's doing great work, right? We love them. They're awesome. they're part of them. They're awesome. they're part of them. They're awesome. they're part of the the the community. Even if we gave them money, community. Even if we gave them money, community. Even if we gave them money, even if we said, "You know what? We even if we said, "You know what? We even if we said, "You know what? We trust you. You're like, "Our lawyers trust you. You're like, "Our lawyers trust you. You're like, "Our lawyers don't know who the hell you are, but don't know who the hell you are, but don't know who the hell you are, but we'll just write it. We'll throw you we'll just write it. We'll throw you we'll just write it. We'll throw you some cash and maybe you'll go to Fiji or some cash and maybe you'll go to Fiji or some cash and maybe you'll go to Fiji or maybe you'll do some work." Talk about maybe you'll do some work." Talk about maybe you'll do some work." Talk about non-inforcability. There's literally no non-inforcability. There's literally no non-inforcability. There's literally no reputational thing there reputational thing there reputational thing there whatsoever. They don't have the extra whatsoever. They don't have the extra whatsoever. They don't have the extra time and they're juggling a thousand time and they're juggling a thousand time and they're juggling a thousand priorities. And to be blunt, they're priorities. And to be blunt, they're priorities. And to be blunt, they're probably not even competent to do the probably not even competent to do the probably not even competent to do the work they're asking them to do there work they're asking them to do there work they're asking them to do there because that's how they got into this because that's how they got into this because that's how they got into this problem in the first place, right? the problem in the first place, right? the problem in the first place, right? the people who are competent on the people who are competent on the people who are competent on the particular body of code are not experts particular body of code are not experts particular body of code are not experts in the problems that we're asking them in the problems that we're asking them in the problems that we're asking them to to to solve. That doesn't magically go away solve. That doesn't magically go away solve. That doesn't magically go away when you add money. Um, and it's really when you add money. Um, and it's really when you add money. Um, and it's really expensive. It becomes a staffing role on expensive. It becomes a staffing role on expensive. It becomes a staffing role on a project of one. I don't mind paying a project of one. I don't mind paying a project of one. I don't mind paying for a staffing role at Eclipse for a staffing role at Eclipse for a staffing role at Eclipse Foundation with how many developers Foundation with how many developers Foundation with how many developers total across the Eclipse Foundation? total across the Eclipse Foundation? total across the Eclipse Foundation? Yeah. No, across all Yeah. No, across all Yeah. No, across all projects. 2500 developers in Eclipse projects. 2500 developers in Eclipse projects. 2500 developers in Eclipse Foundation are benefiting from Mika and Foundation are benefiting from Mika and Foundation are benefiting from Mika and his team doing security infrastructure his team doing security infrastructure his team doing security infrastructure work. work. work. If instead I go to Fred or Mary working If instead I go to Fred or Mary working If instead I go to Fred or Mary working on really cool open source project on really cool open source project on really cool open source project something and give them enough money to something and give them enough money to something and give them enough money to keep working on it, the leverage is keep working on it, the leverage is keep working on it, the leverage is zero, right? And the risk is super zero, right? And the risk is super zero, right? And the risk is super high. And part of the problem here is high. And part of the problem here is high. And part of the problem here is that open source projects are actually that open source projects are actually that open source projects are actually just as capitalistic as corporations just as capitalistic as corporations just as capitalistic as corporations are. Right? So why are corporations are. Right? So why are corporations are. Right? So why are corporations terrible at security? terrible at security? terrible at security? Anyone? It's right there. You don't have Anyone? It's right there. You don't have Anyone? It's right there. You don't have to like I gave you the answer, right? to like I gave you the answer, right? to like I gave you the answer, right? Because if you're working on security Because if you're working on security Because if you're working on security and some other company is working on and some other company is working on and some other company is working on growth, the customers are too stupid or growth, the customers are too stupid or growth, the customers are too stupid or too slow to figure out the problem or too slow to figure out the problem or too slow to figure out the problem or you can wait till later on and there's you can wait till later on and there's you can wait till later on and there's no regulation forcing you to be that no regulation forcing you to be that no regulation forcing you to be that way. And so you're going to lose to the way. And so you're going to lose to the way. And so you're going to lose to the one that's focusing on growth, more one that's focusing on growth, more one that's focusing on growth, more features, more sales, more whatever, features, more sales, more whatever, features, more sales, more whatever, right? And so everybody prioritizes right? And so everybody prioritizes right? And so everybody prioritizes growth until they have achieved some growth until they have achieved some growth until they have achieved some position of market comfort that allows position of market comfort that allows position of market comfort that allows them to say, "Shit, we better protect them to say, "Shit, we better protect them to say, "Shit, we better protect this success that we've had with some this success that we've had with some this success that we've had with some security, otherwise we're going to look security, otherwise we're going to look security, otherwise we're going to look like a bunch of idiots." Right? That is like a bunch of idiots." Right? That is like a bunch of idiots." Right? That is every corporation ever. every corporation ever. every corporation ever. open source projects are the same open source projects are the same open source projects are the same whether they're competing for money or whether they're competing for money or whether they're competing for money or for GitHub stars or dependence or some for GitHub stars or dependence or some for GitHub stars or dependence or some sort of attention or their own as an sort of attention or their own as an sort of attention or their own as an individual developer validation of I'm individual developer validation of I'm individual developer validation of I'm working on something really cool and working on something really cool and working on something really cool and important they tend to focus on what important they tend to focus on what important they tend to focus on what their customers are telling them or what their customers are telling them or what their customers are telling them or what they think is needed or god help us they think is needed or god help us they think is needed or god help us they're going to build the next version they're going to build the next version they're going to build the next version two and it's going to be much better two and it's going to be much better two and it's going to be much better this time so that's a problem and then we get time so that's a problem and then we get time so that's a problem and then we get to the public infrastructure things like to the public infrastructure things like to the public infrastructure things like the package managers the package managers the package managers Right. And there's a mix here. They're Right. And there's a mix here. They're Right. And there's a mix here. They're spread across. There are a bunch of spread across. There are a bunch of spread across. There are a bunch of package manager things that are run by package manager things that are run by package manager things that are run by corporations. Some of them feel like corporations. Some of them feel like corporations. Some of them feel like they've caught the tiger by the tail and they've caught the tiger by the tail and they've caught the tiger by the tail and they don't know what to do with it they don't know what to do with it they don't know what to do with it anymore. Um, some of them haven't anymore. Um, some of them haven't anymore. Um, some of them haven't realized that yet. There's a few of them realized that yet. There's a few of them realized that yet. There's a few of them that are run by open source projects. that are run by open source projects. that are run by open source projects. Notably, Pippi, Rust, and Ruby are the Notably, Pippi, Rust, and Ruby are the Notably, Pippi, Rust, and Ruby are the three most obvious ones. three most obvious ones. three most obvious ones. uh and they survive by the grace of uh and they survive by the grace of uh and they survive by the grace of companies like Fastley that donate huge companies like Fastley that donate huge companies like Fastley that donate huge amounts of cloud credits to them to run amounts of cloud credits to them to run amounts of cloud credits to them to run their CDNs and the big clouds also their CDNs and the big clouds also their CDNs and the big clouds also donate cloud donate cloud donate cloud credits and that's great except for the credits and that's great except for the credits and that's great except for the fact that nobody understands the fact that nobody understands the fact that nobody understands the economics of these projects. Their economics of these projects. Their economics of these projects. Their operational and security costs look like operational and security costs look like operational and security costs look like this and their OSPO revenue looks like this and their OSPO revenue looks like this and their OSPO revenue looks like this and their cloud credits could this and their cloud credits could this and their cloud credits could disappear anytime somebody has a bad disappear anytime somebody has a bad disappear anytime somebody has a bad quarter. I want to call out Hannah quarter. I want to call out Hannah quarter. I want to call out Hannah Aubrey, who's not here, but used to work Aubrey, who's not here, but used to work Aubrey, who's not here, but used to work at Fastley. And even before I asked her, at Fastley. And even before I asked her, at Fastley. And even before I asked her, she was already planning and setting up she was already planning and setting up she was already planning and setting up five-year contracts for their open five-year contracts for their open five-year contracts for their open source recipients, so that when Fastly source recipients, so that when Fastly source recipients, so that when Fastly gives them a contract to give them CDN gives them a contract to give them CDN gives them a contract to give them CDN coverage, it's a five-year deal. That coverage, it's a five-year deal. That coverage, it's a five-year deal. That kind of stability is really great. The kind of stability is really great. The kind of stability is really great. The clouds do not do that, Michael. They should. No public shaming here, right, should. No public shaming here, right, should. No public shaming here, right, Michael? He's only my partner. What Michael? He's only my partner. What Michael? He's only my partner. What could you do wrong? So, we're working on could you do wrong? So, we're working on could you do wrong? So, we're working on this. This is a really hard problem. How this. This is a really hard problem. How this. This is a really hard problem. How do you know and and one of the things do you know and and one of the things do you know and and one of the things that people that people that people often don't understand or think about often don't understand or think about often don't understand or think about when you look at any business guarantee when you look at any business guarantee when you look at any business guarantee every one of your businesses has three every one of your businesses has three every one of your businesses has three types of things inside it rain makers types of things inside it rain makers types of things inside it rain makers not for profofits and charities the rain not for profofits and charities the rain not for profofits and charities the rain makers are the primary business so in makers are the primary business so in makers are the primary business so in the cloud space I used to work in it's the cloud space I used to work in it's the cloud space I used to work in it's comput storage and networking right then comput storage and networking right then comput storage and networking right then you have not the not for profofits you have not the not for profofits you have not the not for profofits things like key storage you know key things like key storage you know key things like key storage you know key management CI/CD tooling you can charge management CI/CD tooling you can charge management CI/CD tooling you can charge for it it's not going to make any for it it's not going to make any for it it's not going to make any It's just not. It'll make enough It's just not. It'll make enough It's just not. It'll make enough money to cover its costs, but compared money to cover its costs, but compared money to cover its costs, but compared to the compute revenue, the storage to the compute revenue, the storage to the compute revenue, the storage revenue, the network revenue, it's going revenue, the network revenue, it's going revenue, the network revenue, it's going to be an also ran every day of the week. to be an also ran every day of the week. to be an also ran every day of the week. But it needs to charge because a But it needs to charge because a But it needs to charge because a customers value things more when they customers value things more when they customers value things more when they charge for it. And b because it has to charge for it. And b because it has to charge for it. And b because it has to keep up with the platform. It has to keep up with the platform. It has to keep up with the platform. It has to keep inputting security features, keep inputting security features, keep inputting security features, infrastructure features, compliance infrastructure features, compliance infrastructure features, compliance features, all those things. And that features, all those things. And that features, all those things. And that costs real money. And the operation of costs real money. And the operation of costs real money. And the operation of that service costs real money. And then that service costs real money. And then that service costs real money. And then charities like SDKs and documentation, charities like SDKs and documentation, charities like SDKs and documentation, no one's paying you for the no one's paying you for the no one's paying you for the documentation on your cloud. So you're documentation on your cloud. So you're documentation on your cloud. So you're going to have to do that. and you're going to have to do that. and you're going to have to do that. and you're going to have to come up with a going to have to come up with a going to have to come up with a budgetary model to fund it adequately to budgetary model to fund it adequately to budgetary model to fund it adequately to the the the organization. So the problem organization. So the problem organization. So the problem is that our package is that our package is that our package infrastructures are running as charities infrastructures are running as charities infrastructures are running as charities on flat donations as opposed to running on flat donations as opposed to running on flat donations as opposed to running as not for profofits with a revenue as not for profofits with a revenue as not for profofits with a revenue model. And so the line has already been model. And so the line has already been model. And so the line has already been crossed. Their costs and their future crossed. Their costs and their future crossed. Their costs and their future costs are like this and the revenues are costs are like this and the revenues are costs are like this and the revenues are below below below that. And from a security point of view, that. And from a security point of view, that. And from a security point of view, that is a nightmare in the making. So that is a nightmare in the making. So that is a nightmare in the making. So this is not an ask for money, but if you this is not an ask for money, but if you this is not an ask for money, but if you want to help, we'll talk. So business want to help, we'll talk. So business want to help, we'll talk. So business model is much more important than a model is much more important than a model is much more important than a funding model. OSO's coughing up cash is funding model. OSO's coughing up cash is funding model. OSO's coughing up cash is cute, but if the product is an cute, but if the product is an cute, but if the product is an operational service and has on I will operational service and has on I will operational service and has on I will again make these slides available. Um again make these slides available. Um again make these slides available. Um you know you will you will have a you know you will you will have a you know you will you will have a problem. We are currently living in that problem. We are currently living in that problem. We are currently living in that financial debt, organizational debt financial debt, organizational debt financial debt, organizational debt already. already. already. This, by the way, at our annual board This, by the way, at our annual board This, by the way, at our annual board meeting for Alpha Omega was deemed one meeting for Alpha Omega was deemed one meeting for Alpha Omega was deemed one of the most interesting and hard of the most interesting and hard of the most interesting and hard problems that we're going to solve this problems that we're going to solve this problems that we're going to solve this year. And by solve, I mean year. And by solve, I mean year. And by solve, I mean start. So, let's talk about you. So, start. So, let's talk about you. So, start. So, let's talk about you. So, you're consuming open source. I've you're consuming open source. I've you're consuming open source. I've worked with a lot of open source worked with a lot of open source worked with a lot of open source projects and I've had the pleasure of projects and I've had the pleasure of projects and I've had the pleasure of also working a lot of organizations that also working a lot of organizations that also working a lot of organizations that work with open source projects, right? work with open source projects, right? work with open source projects, right? Let's just start by saying that every Let's just start by saying that every Let's just start by saying that every single dependency you have in your single dependency you have in your single dependency you have in your business, in your open source project, business, in your open source project, business, in your open source project, whether it's open source, private, whether it's open source, private, whether it's open source, private, personal, whatever it doesn't matter, personal, whatever it doesn't matter, personal, whatever it doesn't matter, right? every dependence you have. It's right? every dependence you have. It's right? every dependence you have. It's your code. It's not someone else's code. your code. It's not someone else's code. your code. It's not someone else's code. You can talk about they all you want. If You can talk about they all you want. If You can talk about they all you want. If you put it into your application, it is you put it into your application, it is you put it into your application, it is in your build environment. It is in your in your build environment. It is in your in your build environment. It is in your production environment. It has total production environment. It has total production environment. It has total access to both. And anything goes wrong access to both. And anything goes wrong access to both. And anything goes wrong with it is your problem. Not the with it is your problem. Not the with it is your problem. Not the maintainers. You have no vendor maintainers. You have no vendor maintainers. You have no vendor relationship. You have no contract. You relationship. You have no contract. You relationship. You have no contract. You have no have no have no nothing. And I like if you're not nothing. And I like if you're not nothing. And I like if you're not feeling that tightness in your chest of feeling that tightness in your chest of feeling that tightness in your chest of like, I'm screwing this up now like, I'm screwing this up now like, I'm screwing this up now already. How do I tell my boss to deal already. How do I tell my boss to deal already. How do I tell my boss to deal with this? You should because every one with this? You should because every one with this? You should because every one of you and I know this because I've of you and I know this because I've of you and I know this because I've talked to a lot of businesses is doing talked to a lot of businesses is doing talked to a lot of businesses is doing it wrong, including the big ones. You it wrong, including the big ones. You it wrong, including the big ones. You cannot treat your software as if it came cannot treat your software as if it came cannot treat your software as if it came down on the back of a unicorn and is down on the back of a unicorn and is down on the back of a unicorn and is pure and perfect and everything is pure and perfect and everything is pure and perfect and everything is awesome. All awesome. All awesome. All right? So, most people think of open right? So, most people think of open right? So, most people think of open source as free as in beer. It's free as source as free as in beer. It's free as source as free as in beer. It's free as in puppies. Those puppies are tearing up in puppies. Those puppies are tearing up in puppies. Those puppies are tearing up your couch, pissing on your carpet, and your couch, pissing on your carpet, and your couch, pissing on your carpet, and generally scaring the neighbors and not generally scaring the neighbors and not generally scaring the neighbors and not paying attention. Right? Another another paying attention. Right? Another another paying attention. Right? Another another analogy for you. We're all building analogy for you. We're all building analogy for you. We're all building software on the shoulders of giants, but software on the shoulders of giants, but software on the shoulders of giants, but those giants are drunk and they're those giants are drunk and they're those giants are drunk and they're running downhill at full speed and you running downhill at full speed and you running downhill at full speed and you are a tiny little thing on top of a are a tiny little thing on top of a are a tiny little thing on top of a giant, right? Your stack doesn't look as giant, right? Your stack doesn't look as giant, right? Your stack doesn't look as significant as you think. So here you significant as you think. So here you significant as you think. So here you go. Most of your risk from your go. Most of your risk from your go. Most of your risk from your software is internal external. Most of software is internal external. Most of software is internal external. Most of your spend is internal. If your organization is not in internal. If your organization is not in internal. If your organization is not in a tech space in a rapidly expanding a tech space in a rapidly expanding a tech space in a rapidly expanding landscape, it's called AI for this year, landscape, it's called AI for this year, landscape, it's called AI for this year, right? Then your tech organization is right? Then your tech organization is right? Then your tech organization is probably budgeted as a percent of your probably budgeted as a percent of your probably budgeted as a percent of your revenues. What percent of your IT budget revenues. What percent of your IT budget revenues. What percent of your IT budget is spent on software development? What is spent on software development? What is spent on software development? What percent of that is spent on upstream percent of that is spent on upstream percent of that is spent on upstream engagement? Forget maintenance, just engagement? Forget maintenance, just engagement? Forget maintenance, just even engaging, right? For most even engaging, right? For most even engaging, right? For most organizations, it is vanishingly small, organizations, it is vanishingly small, organizations, it is vanishingly small, close to close to close to zero. If you talk to a riskmanagement zero. If you talk to a riskmanagement zero. If you talk to a riskmanagement person about that kind of situation, person about that kind of situation, person about that kind of situation, they would have a different they would have a different they would have a different conversation. So, here's my pro tip. You conversation. So, here's my pro tip. You conversation. So, here's my pro tip. You can't sell security, but compliance wins can't sell security, but compliance wins can't sell security, but compliance wins every day of the week. And we are wander every day of the week. And we are wander every day of the week. And we are wander and I'm not going to talk about CRA and and I'm not going to talk about CRA and and I'm not going to talk about CRA and 14028 things like that, but like we are 14028 things like that, but like we are 14028 things like that, but like we are wandering into a world where the wandering into a world where the wandering into a world where the governments are getting a little tired governments are getting a little tired governments are getting a little tired of industry's inability to solve this of industry's inability to solve this of industry's inability to solve this problem because they're competing as problem because they're competing as problem because they're competing as opposed to securing. And so regulation opposed to securing. And so regulation opposed to securing. And so regulation is going to force us to raise our story is going to force us to raise our story is going to force us to raise our story in various ways and we're all going to in various ways and we're all going to in various ways and we're all going to struggle. But the way to change your struggle. But the way to change your struggle. But the way to change your priorities inside, the easiest way to do priorities inside, the easiest way to do priorities inside, the easiest way to do that is connecting it to compliance that is connecting it to compliance that is connecting it to compliance because compliance is very close to because compliance is very close to because compliance is very close to revenue. revenue. revenue. So there are various ways to talk about So there are various ways to talk about So there are various ways to talk about criticality and people have their own criticality and people have their own criticality and people have their own metrics. There's a thing that Rob Pike metrics. There's a thing that Rob Pike metrics. There's a thing that Rob Pike wrote about five years ago about looking wrote about five years ago about looking wrote about five years ago about looking at the number of GitHub stars and number at the number of GitHub stars and number at the number of GitHub stars and number of dependents and other there is like of dependents and other there is like of dependents and other there is like that that notion was quaint five years that that notion was quaint five years that that notion was quaint five years ago. It is not true anymore. It is not ago. It is not true anymore. It is not ago. It is not true anymore. It is not correct. Going back to my point, the correct. Going back to my point, the correct. Going back to my point, the smallest dependency you have, the most smallest dependency you have, the most smallest dependency you have, the most insignificant little left pad-like text insignificant little left pad-like text insignificant little left pad-like text string string string formatter has total access to your formatter has total access to your formatter has total access to your environment. And if the developer of environment. And if the developer of environment. And if the developer of that walks away and takes their to that walks away and takes their to that walks away and takes their to throws their toys out of the prem and throws their toys out of the prem and throws their toys out of the prem and breaks your build because you don't breaks your build because you don't breaks your build because you don't cache your dependencies, right, your cache your dependencies, right, your cache your dependencies, right, your build is broken. If they walk away and build is broken. If they walk away and build is broken. If they walk away and then have a domain takeover and somebody then have a domain takeover and somebody then have a domain takeover and somebody takes over the stuff and starts takes over the stuff and starts takes over the stuff and starts injecting code, we're now dependent upon injecting code, we're now dependent upon injecting code, we're now dependent upon your malware detection of legitimate your malware detection of legitimate your malware detection of legitimate code, not tampered code, but legitimate code, not tampered code, but legitimate code, not tampered code, but legitimate code coming up through your supply code coming up through your supply code coming up through your supply chain. Right? Your weaknesses are about chain. Right? Your weaknesses are about chain. Right? Your weaknesses are about the processes, not any one project. the processes, not any one project. the processes, not any one project. There are no small dependencies. There are no small dependencies. There are no small dependencies. there are just insufficient processes there are just insufficient processes there are just insufficient processes around them. Every single line of code around them. Every single line of code around them. Every single line of code has access to like you know unless has access to like you know unless has access to like you know unless you're very good with your build system, you're very good with your build system, you're very good with your build system, right? You're running scripts and in right? You're running scripts and in right? You're running scripts and in install scripts from packages that have install scripts from packages that have install scripts from packages that have the ability to go off and excfiltrate the ability to go off and excfiltrate the ability to go off and excfiltrate information from your information from your information from your build. And it's possible you've locked build. And it's possible you've locked build. And it's possible you've locked down your production environments really down your production environments really down your production environments really well, but most organizations are still well, but most organizations are still well, but most organizations are still struggling to do that. struggling to do that. struggling to do that. So don't use somebody's criticality So don't use somebody's criticality So don't use somebody's criticality score. Look at it from your context and score. Look at it from your context and score. Look at it from your context and assume that it has total access to your assume that it has total access to your assume that it has total access to your environment and think about risk that environment and think about risk that environment and think about risk that way and start prioritizing your way and start prioritizing your way and start prioritizing your environments with the code that you put environments with the code that you put environments with the code that you put in them. How much do you know about that in them. How much do you know about that in them. How much do you know about that code? How much are you reviewing that code? How much are you reviewing that code? How much are you reviewing that code? Would you let one of your code? Would you let one of your code? Would you let one of your engineers put unreed code into your engineers put unreed code into your engineers put unreed code into your login system? If the answer is yes, I login system? If the answer is yes, I login system? If the answer is yes, I can't help can't help can't help you. So I think I sort of made the point you. So I think I sort of made the point you. So I think I sort of made the point again through size as risk. Um this was again through size as risk. Um this was again through size as risk. Um this was hilarious by the way. I I on a lark uh I hilarious by the way. I I on a lark uh I hilarious by the way. I I on a lark uh I got Michael here. We asked an AI to got Michael here. We asked an AI to got Michael here. We asked an AI to generate the XKCD image uh as a bunch of generate the XKCD image uh as a bunch of generate the XKCD image uh as a bunch of like computer boxes. Uh I am so beyond like computer boxes. Uh I am so beyond like computer boxes. Uh I am so beyond tickled with that particular image. It's tickled with that particular image. It's tickled with that particular image. It's lovely. So, okay. So, here are your lovely. So, okay. So, here are your lovely. So, okay. So, here are your choices. You're like, well, Michael, choices. You're like, well, Michael, choices. You're like, well, Michael, you've just told me I'm screwed and I you've just told me I'm screwed and I you've just told me I'm screwed and I have I'm not doing the job. What am I have I'm not doing the job. What am I have I'm not doing the job. What am I supposed to do about it? You have supposed to do about it? You have supposed to do about it? You have exactly three choices, right? You look exactly three choices, right? You look exactly three choices, right? You look at your upstream supply. You either find at your upstream supply. You either find at your upstream supply. You either find a way to fix it. We can talk about that a way to fix it. We can talk about that a way to fix it. We can talk about that adnauseium. Engaging with them, even adnauseium. Engaging with them, even adnauseium. Engaging with them, even knowing who they are and talking to knowing who they are and talking to knowing who they are and talking to them. Having any engineer on your them. Having any engineer on your them. Having any engineer on your company who is able to commit a PR to company who is able to commit a PR to company who is able to commit a PR to fix a problem before somebody else gets fix a problem before somebody else gets fix a problem before somebody else gets around to doing it, right? Is a good around to doing it, right? Is a good around to doing it, right? Is a good way. Paying a vendor to fix the thing way. Paying a vendor to fix the thing way. Paying a vendor to fix the thing for you, it's an okay way. Depends on for you, it's an okay way. Depends on for you, it's an okay way. Depends on how you trust the vendor and watching how you trust the vendor and watching how you trust the vendor and watching their results. Fixing is a really good their results. Fixing is a really good their results. Fixing is a really good path. and you can work all the way up at path. and you can work all the way up at path. and you can work all the way up at the top of the supply chain to some deep the top of the supply chain to some deep the top of the supply chain to some deep dependency and go and say, "Hey, there's dependency and go and say, "Hey, there's dependency and go and say, "Hey, there's a bug here. Can I fix it, it has issues a bug here. Can I fix it, it has issues a bug here. Can I fix it, it has issues because it'll take a while for it to because it'll take a while for it to because it'll take a while for it to percolate through your dependency percolate through your dependency percolate through your dependency graph." Forking is another option, graph." Forking is another option, graph." Forking is another option, right? And you don't have to hard fork right? And you don't have to hard fork right? And you don't have to hard fork it, but let's be clear, if you're not it, but let's be clear, if you're not it, but let's be clear, if you're not keeping up to date with your keeping up to date with your keeping up to date with your dependencies, you are carrying a bunch dependencies, you are carrying a bunch dependencies, you are carrying a bunch of hard forks around that are of hard forks around that are of hard forks around that are unmaintained, unsanctioned, unknown, and unmaintained, unsanctioned, unknown, and unmaintained, unsanctioned, unknown, and unclear, right? And certain large unclear, right? And certain large unclear, right? And certain large companies who were based in Redmond used companies who were based in Redmond used companies who were based in Redmond used to have a policy of a huge barrier to to have a policy of a huge barrier to to have a policy of a huge barrier to get an open source project for use get an open source project for use get an open source project for use inside and then the same barrier to get inside and then the same barrier to get inside and then the same barrier to get an update to it. How did that work out, an update to it. How did that work out, an update to it. How did that work out, Michael? Michael? Michael? Vulnerabilities, right? Other companies Vulnerabilities, right? Other companies Vulnerabilities, right? Other companies have similar failings. Believe me, it's have similar failings. Believe me, it's have similar failings. Believe me, it's all the same. Forking is hard because all the same. Forking is hard because all the same. Forking is hard because you have to be able to build that stuff. you have to be able to build that stuff. you have to be able to build that stuff. But if you start building it and you But if you start building it and you But if you start building it and you this wasn't so hard at all, maybe you this wasn't so hard at all, maybe you this wasn't so hard at all, maybe you can build everything and get rid of a can build everything and get rid of a can build everything and get rid of a whole bunch of tamper risks and have whole bunch of tamper risks and have whole bunch of tamper risks and have control over your supply chain. control over your supply chain. control over your supply chain. One of the best things you can do is One of the best things you can do is One of the best things you can do is realize that I don't need this and realize that I don't need this and realize that I don't need this and stop using some random thing because stop using some random thing because stop using some random thing because somebody said it was really cool and it somebody said it was really cool and it somebody said it was really cool and it was easier. Right? There is no greater was easier. Right? There is no greater was easier. Right? There is no greater force in the universe. Right? You've got force in the universe. Right? You've got force in the universe. Right? You've got like electromagnetic and this and that like electromagnetic and this and that like electromagnetic and this and that strong nuclear and then an engineer strong nuclear and then an engineer strong nuclear and then an engineer working at an insurance company whose working at an insurance company whose working at an insurance company whose boss is on their ass telling them you boss is on their ass telling them you boss is on their ass telling them you got to get this thing done by the end of got to get this thing done by the end of got to get this thing done by the end of the month.

If it gets tabain to sloppy and they get to it gets tabain to sloppy and they get to it gets tabain to sloppy and they get to their weekend, they're doing it, right? their weekend, they're doing it, right? their weekend, they're doing it, right? So, you know, you have to have a plan So, you know, you have to have a plan So, you know, you have to have a plan for that. You have to stop using crappy for that. You have to stop using crappy for that. You have to stop using crappy packages. You have to think about how packages. You have to think about how packages. You have to think about how your ingestion works, how you even your ingestion works, how you even your ingestion works, how you even allowing packages into your system, allowing packages into your system, allowing packages into your system, right? If you know that npm install food right? If you know that npm install food right? If you know that npm install food is a bad idea, how are you stopping is a bad idea, how are you stopping is a bad idea, how are you stopping engineers from doing that? Right? These engineers from doing that? Right? These engineers from doing that? Right? These are important questions. And then after are important questions. And then after are important questions. And then after they happen, how the hell do you get rid they happen, how the hell do you get rid they happen, how the hell do you get rid of things that you didn't want to have of things that you didn't want to have of things that you didn't want to have in your supply chain? One of the in your supply chain? One of the in your supply chain? One of the interesting hybrids of these two is interesting hybrids of these two is interesting hybrids of these two is forking and forgoing. If there's forking and forgoing. If there's forking and forgoing. If there's something you're using and you realize, something you're using and you realize, something you're using and you realize, I only use like these little bits of I only use like these little bits of I only use like these little bits of code. Well, then why are you bringing code. Well, then why are you bringing code. Well, then why are you bringing all this other attack surface, right? all this other attack surface, right? all this other attack surface, right? And you look at the code, you say, "It And you look at the code, you say, "It And you look at the code, you say, "It was nice. They wrote it once. We could was nice. They wrote it once. We could was nice. They wrote it once. We could maintain this." And so you do a a hard maintain this." And so you do a a hard maintain this." And so you do a a hard fork of a very small piece of it and fork of a very small piece of it and fork of a very small piece of it and just say, "You know what? We own this just say, "You know what? We own this just say, "You know what? We own this code." String string formatting, I think code." String string formatting, I think code." String string formatting, I think we're going to do this ourselves. The we're going to do this ourselves. The we're going to do this ourselves. The risk is not worth it. And this is again risk is not worth it. And this is again risk is not worth it. And this is again where that internal cost versus that where that internal cost versus that where that internal cost versus that hidden external cost plays out. Doing hidden external cost plays out. Doing hidden external cost plays out. Doing the math properly here will actually the math properly here will actually the math properly here will actually save you a lot of grief in the long save you a lot of grief in the long save you a lot of grief in the long run. So the conclusion of that is it's run. So the conclusion of that is it's run. So the conclusion of that is it's not your just your code, it's your not your just your code, it's your not your just your code, it's your problem, right? And I really want you to problem, right? And I really want you to problem, right? And I really want you to just internalize that. It is so just internalize that. It is so just internalize that. It is so valuable. So but the most important valuable. So but the most important valuable. So but the most important thing, how am I doing on time? I'm doing thing, how am I doing on time? I'm doing thing, how am I doing on time? I'm doing great. This is good. Okay. Of all the great. This is good. Okay. Of all the great. This is good. Okay. Of all the things that we've learned over the past things that we've learned over the past things that we've learned over the past three years, the most important thing is three years, the most important thing is three years, the most important thing is that it's about people. So this is just that it's about people. So this is just that it's about people. So this is just a subset of the people we got to work a subset of the people we got to work a subset of the people we got to work with over the past few years. But the with over the past few years. But the with over the past few years. But the real point here is not that you know who real point here is not that you know who real point here is not that you know who any of these are. I can point a laser at any of these are. I can point a laser at any of these are. I can point a laser at one of them. Uh that's that's Jonathan. one of them. Uh that's that's Jonathan. one of them. Uh that's that's Jonathan. He gave us a lot of money. That was He gave us a lot of money. That was He gave us a lot of money. That was really awesome. That's Mark Rinovich. really awesome. That's Mark Rinovich. really awesome. That's Mark Rinovich. There's Eric Brewer. There's DNA. There There's Eric Brewer. There's DNA. There There's Eric Brewer. There's DNA. There are executive stakeholders at the are executive stakeholders at the are executive stakeholders at the companies that are essentially providing companies that are essentially providing companies that are essentially providing us air cover things. But they just gave us air cover things. But they just gave us air cover things. But they just gave money. These people did work. They money. These people did work. They money. These people did work. They create real value. create real value. create real value. And what we get out of it is by And what we get out of it is by And what we get out of it is by literally having social connections with literally having social connections with literally having social connections with those people, we can trust them to do those people, we can trust them to do those people, we can trust them to do greater things. My contracts don't I greater things. My contracts don't I greater things. My contracts don't I somebody says, "Well, how should I somebody says, "Well, how should I somebody says, "Well, how should I estimate this work?" I say, "Estimate it estimate this work?" I say, "Estimate it estimate this work?" I say, "Estimate it the best you can. If you're wrong, we'll the best you can. If you're wrong, we'll the best you can. If you're wrong, we'll figure out how to give you more money. figure out how to give you more money. figure out how to give you more money. Don't sandbag me or don't give me buffer Don't sandbag me or don't give me buffer Don't sandbag me or don't give me buffer estimates because then we're just estimates because then we're just estimates because then we're just wasting money for both of us." There's wasting money for both of us." There's wasting money for both of us." There's trust. And as a consumer of open source, trust. And as a consumer of open source, trust. And as a consumer of open source, right, you should have a relationship right, you should have a relationship right, you should have a relationship with the stuff you consume. You wouldn't with the stuff you consume. You wouldn't with the stuff you consume. You wouldn't use a vendor without having some sort of use a vendor without having some sort of use a vendor without having some sort of vendor trust established, right? The vendor trust established, right? The vendor trust established, right? The more known the vendor, the more likely more known the vendor, the more likely more known the vendor, the more likely the contract is to be painful. The less the contract is to be painful. The less the contract is to be painful. The less known the vendor, the more like you have known the vendor, the more like you have known the vendor, the more like you have somebody whose job it is to hassle that somebody whose job it is to hassle that somebody whose job it is to hassle that vendor and keep things on track. And vendor and keep things on track. And vendor and keep things on track.

It tells you that we think it's very tells you that we think it's very tells you that we think it's very effective and we plan to keep doing effective and we plan to keep doing effective and we plan to keep doing that. We're being a little bit more that. We're being a little bit more that. We're being a little bit more cautious about taking on more staffing cautious about taking on more staffing cautious about taking on more staffing engagements because otherwise it'll just engagements because otherwise it'll just engagements because otherwise it'll just eat our whole eat our whole eat our whole budget. Package repos are the app stores budget. Package repos are the app stores budget. Package repos are the app stores of software development. Whether we like of software development. Whether we like of software development. Whether we like it or not, developers make huge trust it or not, developers make huge trust it or not, developers make huge trust decisions, assumptions that the package decisions, assumptions that the package decisions, assumptions that the package repo is providing certain guarantees of repo is providing certain guarantees of repo is providing certain guarantees of namespace correctness and no malware and namespace correctness and no malware and namespace correctness and no malware and other basic truths.

Um, that are slightly different focus. Um, that are slightly different focus. Um, we are very keen and increasingly we are very keen and increasingly we are very keen and increasingly shoving people towards to creating a shoving people towards to creating a shoving people towards to creating a co-unding opportunity. We're trying to co-unding opportunity. We're trying to co-unding opportunity. We're trying to normalize it for organizations to say, normalize it for organizations to say, normalize it for organizations to say, you know what, I could help out. And we you know what, I could help out. And we you know what, I could help out. And we offer a huge multiplier, right? You put offer a huge multiplier, right? You put offer a huge multiplier, right? You put in $10,000, we'll put in 10 from in $10,000, we'll put in 10 from in $10,000, we'll put in 10 from Microsoft, 10 from Google, 10 from Microsoft, 10 from Google, 10 from Microsoft, 10 from Google, 10 from Amazon. We'll get somebody else over Amazon. We'll get somebody else over Amazon. We'll get somebody else over there. And all of a sudden, your 10 is there. And all of a sudden, your 10 is there. And all of a sudden, your 10 is getting a five to 10 to1 ratio impact, getting a five to 10 to1 ratio impact, getting a five to 10 to1 ratio impact, right? That's we'd like to see that right? That's we'd like to see that right? That's we'd like to see that pattern more normal because at any one pattern more normal because at any one pattern more normal because at any one organizational level, this is an organizational level, this is an organizational level, this is an intractable problem. But if a few intractable problem. But if a few intractable problem. But if a few organizations get together towards an organizations get together towards an organizations get together towards an area and care about it, we can make area and care about it, we can make area and care about it, we can make leverage. So for instance, if a bunch leverage. So for instance, if a bunch leverage. So for instance, if a bunch of, you know, I don't know, I'm going to of, you know, I don't know, I'm going to of, you know, I don't know, I'm going to say point of sale businesses got say point of sale businesses got say point of sale businesses got together and said, you know, we're together and said, you know, we're together and said, you know, we're worried about this part of our stack or worried about this part of our stack or worried about this part of our stack or we'd like to go off and do this and they we'd like to go off and do this and they we'd like to go off and do this and they came to us and said, we're worried. We'd came to us and said, we're worried. We'd came to us and said, we're worried. We'd say, we are too. Let's talk. And if they say, we are too. Let's talk. And if they say, we are too. Let's talk. And if they show put some skin in the game, we're show put some skin in the game, we're show put some skin in the game, we're going to put some going to put some going to put some too with the intent that that will then too with the intent that that will then too with the intent that that will then become something that their business can become something that their business can become something that their business can say, you know, we spent that money and say, you know, we spent that money and say, you know, we spent that money and it worked out pretty well. Maybe we it worked out pretty well. Maybe we it worked out pretty well. Maybe we could do, you know, twice as much next could do, you know, twice as much next could do, you know, twice as much next year and not need Alpha Omega or year and not need Alpha Omega or year and not need Alpha Omega or whatever. So, it's a it's a hard whatever. So, it's a it's a hard whatever. So, it's a it's a hard problem. It's very hard to change problem. It's very hard to change problem. It's very hard to change attitudes and businesses and priorities, attitudes and businesses and priorities, attitudes and businesses and priorities, especially when the economy is going to especially when the economy is going to especially when the economy is going to but we're but we're but we're trying. We want to do more audits. We trying. We want to do more audits. We trying. We want to do more audits. We want to make the audits more normal. In want to make the audits more normal. In want to make the audits more normal. In some cases, like even talking about as a some cases, like even talking about as a some cases, like even talking about as a rapid security review says it's not an rapid security review says it's not an rapid security review says it's not an audit because even most of the audits audit because even most of the audits audit because even most of the audits get done aren't really audits. They're get done aren't really audits. They're get done aren't really audits. They're just somebody looked hard at the stuff. just somebody looked hard at the stuff. just somebody looked hard at the stuff. We want to make this a lot easier, a lot We want to make this a lot easier, a lot We want to make this a lot easier, a lot more more more normal. Salsa six store and the security normal. Salsa six store and the security normal. Salsa six store and the security baseline are foundational technologies baseline are foundational technologies baseline are foundational technologies being developed in the community of the being developed in the community of the being developed in the community of the OpenSSF. We think they're very OpenSSF. We think they're very OpenSSF. We think they're very important. They are things that will important. They are things that will important. They are things that will enable transformation across ecosystems. enable transformation across ecosystems. enable transformation across ecosystems. They'll make it easier for us to start They'll make it easier for us to start They'll make it easier for us to start gathering data and making statements gathering data and making statements gathering data and making statements about tampering, about you know uh the about tampering, about you know uh the about tampering, about you know uh the process of an organization and the process of an organization and the process of an organization and the culture of it uh in ways that are culture of it uh in ways that are culture of it uh in ways that are attestable, verifiable, gatherable in attestable, verifiable, gatherable in attestable, verifiable, gatherable in big data forms and so we're still big data forms and so we're still big data forms and so we're still interested in incubating growth there. interested in incubating growth there. interested in incubating growth there. It's still early days. Um one of my It's still early days. Um one of my It's still early days. Um one of my favorite things is that everybody's favorite things is that everybody's favorite things is that everybody's build process is a steaming nightmare of build process is a steaming nightmare of build process is a steaming nightmare of Jenkins write only scripts where people Jenkins write only scripts where people Jenkins write only scripts where people could be adding things. Don't touch us. could be adding things. Don't touch us. could be adding things. Don't touch us. I don't know how it works. If you break I don't know how it works. If you break I don't know how it works. If you break it the test will fail. it the test will fail. it the test will fail. which makes it impossible for anybody which makes it impossible for anybody which makes it impossible for anybody else to build your stuff. That's true else to build your stuff. That's true else to build your stuff. That's true for open source. It's true for for open source. It's true for for open source. It's true for corporations. It makes builds slower, corporations. It makes builds slower, corporations. It makes builds slower, which means people less less likely to which means people less less likely to which means people less less likely to run more tests, which means they're less run more tests, which means they're less run more tests, which means they're less likely to live closer to head. All kinds likely to live closer to head. All kinds likely to live closer to head. All kinds of bad things happening there. In open of bad things happening there. In open of bad things happening there. In open source in particular, uh I think it's it source in particular, uh I think it's it source in particular, uh I think it's it would be very nice to be able to not would be very nice to be able to not would be very nice to be able to not have to make trust decisions about have to make trust decisions about have to make trust decisions about somebody's shitty Jenkins server doing somebody's shitty Jenkins server doing somebody's shitty Jenkins server doing the build for some package. I'd much the build for some package. I'd much the build for some package. I'd much rather just build it myself and have it rather just build it myself and have it rather just build it myself and have it just be a source integrity check. One of just be a source integrity check. One of just be a source integrity check. One of the great things about Go is that Go the great things about Go is that Go the great things about Go is that Go builds everything from source. The builds everything from source. The builds everything from source. The packages are just references to uh packages are just references to uh packages are just references to uh GitHub repos or Earls and then there's a GitHub repos or Earls and then there's a GitHub repos or Earls and then there's a non-repudiation index transparency log, non-repudiation index transparency log, non-repudiation index transparency log, but the compiler just builds it locally but the compiler just builds it locally but the compiler just builds it locally on your machine. So all of the attacks on your machine. So all of the attacks on your machine. So all of the attacks in the Salsa threat model, that's the in the Salsa threat model, that's the in the Salsa threat model, that's the SLSA, all the built system attacks go SLSA, all the built system attacks go SLSA, all the built system attacks go away because it's built on your machine. away because it's built on your machine. away because it's built on your machine. If your build system isn't secure, If your build system isn't secure, If your build system isn't secure, doesn't matter what happened doesn't matter what happened doesn't matter what happened upstream. So reproducible builds are upstream. So reproducible builds are upstream. So reproducible builds are great. The Eclipse Foundation and great. The Eclipse Foundation and great. The Eclipse Foundation and particularly the Adoption project has particularly the Adoption project has particularly the Adoption project has been leading the way there with a Java been leading the way there with a Java been leading the way there with a Java runtime called Team. They're one of the runtime called Team. They're one of the runtime called Team. They're one of the truly great reproducible builds out truly great reproducible builds out truly great reproducible builds out there being verified now by Red Hat as there being verified now by Red Hat as there being verified now by Red Hat as well. Thank you very much to the Red Hat well. Thank you very much to the Red Hat well. Thank you very much to the Red Hat folks. Debian has made incredible folks. Debian has made incredible folks. Debian has made incredible strides towards making their package strides towards making their package strides towards making their package builds reproducible as well. I don't builds reproducible as well. I don't builds reproducible as well. I don't think they've achieved the point where think they've achieved the point where think they've achieved the point where they have multiple organizations they have multiple organizations they have multiple organizations verifying the reproducibility, but that verifying the reproducibility, but that verifying the reproducibility, but that is an important step. So that's sort of is an important step. So that's sort of is an important step. So that's sort of normalizing things that everybody knows normalizing things that everybody knows normalizing things that everybody knows we should be doing but still haven't we should be doing but still haven't we should be doing but still haven't really happened yet. Then some big scary really happened yet. Then some big scary really happened yet. Then some big scary ideas. So there's an awful lot of AI ideas. So there's an awful lot of AI ideas. So there's an awful lot of AI stuff going on these days. It's cool. stuff going on these days. It's cool. stuff going on these days. It's cool. It's hip. I want some, you know, there It's hip. I want some, you know, there It's hip. I want some, you know, there are good reasons and bad. There are an are good reasons and bad. There are an are good reasons and bad. There are an awful lot of open source AI awful lot of open source AI awful lot of open source AI libraries and a lot of people are using libraries and a lot of people are using libraries and a lot of people are using them with really no regard whatsoever to them with really no regard whatsoever to them with really no regard whatsoever to whether they're secure or not, including whether they're secure or not, including whether they're secure or not, including the teams building them. And so we would the teams building them. And so we would the teams building them. And so we would like to instill a better culture of like to instill a better culture of like to instill a better culture of security. Get in there early on security. Get in there early on security. Get in there early on including things like hugging face and including things like hugging face and including things like hugging face and effectively a package manager for effectively a package manager for effectively a package manager for models. So we're keen to do some things models. So we're keen to do some things models. So we're keen to do some things there. We're also very keen to tackle there. We're also very keen to tackle there. We're also very keen to tackle that problem of omega the scale through that problem of omega the scale through that problem of omega the scale through AI and we've taken a few swings at it. AI and we've taken a few swings at it. AI and we've taken a few swings at it. Um you know it's it's quite remarkable Um you know it's it's quite remarkable Um you know it's it's quite remarkable even a like a year ago because about a even a like a year ago because about a even a like a year ago because about a year ago maybe nine months ago we sort year ago maybe nine months ago we sort year ago maybe nine months ago we sort of tried go look at this code and find of tried go look at this code and find of tried go look at this code and find vulnerabilities in the code and we vulnerabilities in the code and we vulnerabilities in the code and we didn't even try very hard and it found didn't even try very hard and it found didn't even try very hard and it found stuff and now when we do it we are able stuff and now when we do it we are able stuff and now when we do it we are able to do some pretty interesting analysis to do some pretty interesting analysis to do some pretty interesting analysis and we're also looking at that sort of and we're also looking at that sort of and we're also looking at that sort of depth first supply chain audit of depth first supply chain audit of depth first supply chain audit of looking a mini audit across it looking a mini audit across it looking a mini audit across it understanding the governance of security understanding the governance of security understanding the governance of security posture and doing a depth first posture and doing a depth first posture and doing a depth first traversal. It's not there yet, but we traversal. It's not there yet, but we traversal. It's not there yet, but we haven't tried very hard and we're very haven't tried very hard and we're very haven't tried very hard and we're very keen because that produces scale and keen because that produces scale and keen because that produces scale and opportunity. It's very interesting. But opportunity. It's very interesting. But opportunity. It's very interesting. But without the remediation part, you still without the remediation part, you still without the remediation part, you still have a problem. And even with the have a problem. And even with the have a problem. And even with the remediation part, as my friends Munoir remediation part, as my friends Munoir remediation part, as my friends Munoir and Jonathan both know, getting the and Jonathan both know, getting the and Jonathan both know, getting the people to accept those changes is very people to accept those changes is very people to accept those changes is very hard. So there are still problems ahead. hard. So there are still problems ahead. hard. So there are still problems ahead. But if we can put it in their hands, But if we can put it in their hands, But if we can put it in their hands, this could be very this could be very this could be very interesting. Uh I talked about business interesting. Uh I talked about business interesting. Uh I talked about business models for sustained open source models for sustained open source models for sustained open source security. We're actually hiring a security. We're actually hiring a security. We're actually hiring a consultant to work with us and actually consultant to work with us and actually consultant to work with us and actually tackle this problem. Working with major tackle this problem. Working with major tackle this problem. Working with major package managers, building an inventory package managers, building an inventory package managers, building an inventory of the problem and coming up with a of the problem and coming up with a of the problem and coming up with a business strategy or proposals for business strategy or proposals for business strategy or proposals for possible business models to allow us to possible business models to allow us to possible business models to allow us to create sustainability for these these create sustainability for these these create sustainability for these these services. It's services. It's services. It's critical. critical. critical. Um almost every business has and most of Um almost every business has and most of Um almost every business has and most of you here incident response team dealing you here incident response team dealing you here incident response team dealing with the regular flow of incidents and with the regular flow of incidents and with the regular flow of incidents and so forth. so forth. so forth. That is not easy to think about when you That is not easy to think about when you That is not easy to think about when you move into an open source ecosystem with move into an open source ecosystem with move into an open source ecosystem with projects of one or two or three people. projects of one or two or three people. projects of one or two or three people. And when it does happen, they either And when it does happen, they either And when it does happen, they either dismiss it or it becomes or they find dismiss it or it becomes or they find dismiss it or it becomes or they find themselves the next XZ and then now in a themselves the next XZ and then now in a themselves the next XZ and then now in a situation of chaos. And at that point in situation of chaos. And at that point in situation of chaos. And at that point in time, if somebody would show up, even if time, if somebody would show up, even if time, if somebody would show up, even if they were wellreputed saying, "Hey, I'm they were wellreputed saying, "Hey, I'm they were wellreputed saying, "Hey, I'm Seth from the Python Software Seth from the Python Software Seth from the Python Software Foundation. I'm here to help you." Foundation. I'm here to help you." Foundation. I'm here to help you." They'd be like, "The hell you are. They'd be like, "The hell you are. They'd be like, "The hell you are. You're another attacker. Show pretend to You're another attacker. Show pretend to You're another attacker. Show pretend to be Seth. How do I know you're mute?" be Seth. How do I know you're mute?" be Seth. How do I know you're mute?" Right? And so we think about this as Right? And so we think about this as Right? And so we think about this as like a volunteer fire department. We like a volunteer fire department. We like a volunteer fire department. We don't have a model yet or a business don't have a model yet or a business don't have a model yet or a business model or even a way to think about it in model or even a way to think about it in model or even a way to think about it in terms of like having a paid fire terms of like having a paid fire terms of like having a paid fire department acting as incident response department acting as incident response department acting as incident response or proactive security or whatever. But or proactive security or whatever. But or proactive security or whatever. But just as the fire department defines the just as the fire department defines the just as the fire department defines the codes, does the inspections, enforces codes, does the inspections, enforces codes, does the inspections, enforces the codes, does fire prevention, the codes, does fire prevention, the codes, does fire prevention, extinguishes extinguishes extinguishes fires, contains fires when it can't fires, contains fires when it can't fires, contains fires when it can't extinguish them, and then does the extinguish them, and then does the extinguish them, and then does the postmortem or the forensic analysis. postmortem or the forensic analysis. postmortem or the forensic analysis. There are a lot of things to be done There are a lot of things to be done There are a lot of things to be done there in the open source ecosystem that there in the open source ecosystem that there in the open source ecosystem that we want to try and sort of think about. we want to try and sort of think about. we want to try and sort of think about. And so we are leveraging our community, And so we are leveraging our community, And so we are leveraging our community, the kind people that are working with the kind people that are working with the kind people that are working with us, those all those pictures up there, us, those all those pictures up there, us, those all those pictures up there, many of them have agreed to be part of a many of them have agreed to be part of a many of them have agreed to be part of a very early effort to think about this. very early effort to think about this. very early effort to think about this. And we're not talking about it much And we're not talking about it much And we're not talking about it much because we still don't know what the because we still don't know what the because we still don't know what the hell we're doing. Yes. Question. I will hell we're doing. Yes. Question. I will hell we're doing. Yes. Question. I will repeat your question for you while I'm repeat your question for you while I'm repeat your question for you while I'm chasing the micron. So I'm going to answer your question. So I'm going to answer your question. So I'm going to answer your question. The question was if I am a consumer of The question was if I am a consumer of The question was if I am a consumer of open source uh how are we responding to open source uh how are we responding to open source uh how are we responding to a fire in some particular project? If I a fire in some particular project? If I a fire in some particular project? If I am a consumer and I call you are you how am a consumer and I call you are you how am a consumer and I call you are you how are you helping? And we're not here for are you helping? And we're not here for are you helping? And we're not here for you. I want to be super clear. the this you. I want to be super clear. the this you. I want to be super clear. the this effort is meant to help the open source effort is meant to help the open source effort is meant to help the open source maintainers cope with their situation, maintainers cope with their situation, maintainers cope with their situation, not you downstream ones who are not you downstream ones who are not you downstream ones who are unfortunately affected by it. Um because unfortunately affected by it. Um because unfortunately affected by it. Um because the resourcing alone is is is un the resourcing alone is is is un the resourcing alone is is is un unimaginable. If a large bunch of unimaginable. If a large bunch of unimaginable. If a large bunch of corporations said, "Man, we all depend corporations said, "Man, we all depend corporations said, "Man, we all depend upon the same stuff and it would really upon the same stuff and it would really upon the same stuff and it would really suck if there'll be another XZ or log suck if there'll be another XZ or log suck if there'll be another XZ or log for shell or whatever happening there. for shell or whatever happening there. for shell or whatever happening there. We should get together and put our We should get together and put our We should get together and put our incident response teams together in incident response teams together in incident response teams together in coordination and have a plan for us to coordination and have a plan for us to coordination and have a plan for us to deal with it. That would be great. And deal with it. That would be great. And deal with it. That would be great. And if you want to talk to me about doing if you want to talk to me about doing if you want to talk to me about doing that in coordination with what we're that in coordination with what we're that in coordination with what we're doing here, that would be doing here, that would be doing here, that would be awesome. I mean, like, you know, awesome. I mean, like, you know, awesome. I mean, like, you know, engagement doesn't necessarily only mean engagement doesn't necessarily only mean engagement doesn't necessarily only mean just writing source code or fixing PRs just writing source code or fixing PRs just writing source code or fixing PRs and creating fixing vulnerabilities, and creating fixing vulnerabilities, and creating fixing vulnerabilities, right? It's all these things. So, I'm right? It's all these things. So, I'm right? It's all these things. So, I'm very open to that very open to that very open to that approach. Uh, what have I missed? Oh, approach. Uh, what have I missed? Oh, approach. Uh, what have I missed? Oh, common open source metadata. So, as we common open source metadata. So, as we common open source metadata. So, as we look at the scale problem and everything look at the scale problem and everything look at the scale problem and everything we did, every time I you can't turn over we did, every time I you can't turn over we did, every time I you can't turn over a stone or swing a something without a stone or swing a something without a stone or swing a something without tripping over a team that has gone off tripping over a team that has gone off tripping over a team that has gone off and recreated the same stupid stuff as and recreated the same stupid stuff as and recreated the same stupid stuff as everybody else. Everybody builds their everybody else. Everybody builds their everybody else. Everybody builds their own crawler to get data out of the NVD own crawler to get data out of the NVD own crawler to get data out of the NVD database. They do the same thing to pull database. They do the same thing to pull database. They do the same thing to pull stuff out of OSV. They go and get GitHub stuff out of OSV. They go and get GitHub stuff out of OSV. They go and get GitHub archive or they pull directly from archive or they pull directly from archive or they pull directly from GitHub or both, right? It's a hot mess GitHub or both, right? It's a hot mess GitHub or both, right? It's a hot mess and everybody builds their own thing and and everybody builds their own thing and and everybody builds their own thing and then they start doing dependency then they start doing dependency then they start doing dependency resolution and figure out what the resolution and figure out what the resolution and figure out what the dependencies of fu are and everybody has dependencies of fu are and everybody has dependencies of fu are and everybody has their own heristic for that because it their own heristic for that because it their own heristic for that because it is not a resolvable question and they is not a resolvable question and they is not a resolvable question and they all do the same thing and they all do all do the same thing and they all do all do the same thing and they all do that all that work just to get to the that all that work just to get to the that all that work just to get to the point where they could start doing some point where they could start doing some point where they could start doing some meaningful analysis at scale across this meaningful analysis at scale across this meaningful analysis at scale across this space and it's all public data. It's all space and it's all public data. It's all space and it's all public data. It's all pretty static too. So why is everybody pretty static too. So why is everybody pretty static too. So why is everybody building this over and over again? building this over and over again? building this over and over again? because the current stories that we have because the current stories that we have because the current stories that we have of central trustable reliable data are of central trustable reliable data are of central trustable reliable data are not either wellknown or not one of those not either wellknown or not one of those not either wellknown or not one of those attributes and still learning about this attributes and still learning about this attributes and still learning about this space a lot but I believe that if we space a lot but I believe that if we space a lot but I believe that if we create a sort of trustworthy public good create a sort of trustworthy public good create a sort of trustworthy public good that has all the metadata is designed to that has all the metadata is designed to that has all the metadata is designed to extend to other forms so you can pull it extend to other forms so you can pull it extend to other forms so you can pull it in and connect it with your own private in and connect it with your own private in and connect it with your own private data you have if you don't have a risk data you have if you don't have a risk data you have if you don't have a risk database of all your dependencies and database of all your dependencies and database of all your dependencies and how you evaluated them. You should and how you evaluated them. You should and how you evaluated them. You should and you should be able to connect that to you should be able to connect that to you should be able to connect that to other data out there to do your own other data out there to do your own other data out there to do your own queries on it. Right? If a company wants queries on it. Right? If a company wants queries on it. Right? If a company wants to go doing scale analysis for Omega to to go doing scale analysis for Omega to to go doing scale analysis for Omega to find the needles in the haststack that find the needles in the haststack that find the needles in the haststack that are risk waiting to happen, they should are risk waiting to happen, they should are risk waiting to happen, they should be able to do that as trivially as be able to do that as trivially as be able to do that as trivially as firing up SQL light and doing some firing up SQL light and doing some firing up SQL light and doing some clever queries. Today it is a mountain clever queries. Today it is a mountain clever queries. Today it is a mountain of work to even get to the starting of work to even get to the starting of work to even get to the starting point of that. And so one of my goals is point of that. And so one of my goals is point of that. And so one of my goals is just to normalize that, flatten the just to normalize that, flatten the just to normalize that, flatten the space and make it very easy for anybody space and make it very easy for anybody space and make it very easy for anybody commercial or open source or research to commercial or open source or research to commercial or open source or research to go off and do useful work on top of. And go off and do useful work on top of. And go off and do useful work on top of. And if a bunch of businesses spring up and if a bunch of businesses spring up and if a bunch of businesses spring up and create enterprise focused businesses create enterprise focused businesses create enterprise focused businesses taking that data and selling it as value taking that data and selling it as value taking that data and selling it as value to enterprises, great. That would be to enterprises, great. That would be to enterprises, great. That would be fantastic. It'll make the world more fantastic. It'll make the world more fantastic. It'll make the world more secure. So, as promised, here is the QR secure. So, as promised, here is the QR secure. So, as promised, here is the QR code to the deck. There's also a link at code to the deck. There's also a link at code to the deck. There's also a link at the bottom, go.xwind.io-lesence-2025. Uh, I have a go.xwind.io-lesence-2025. Uh, I have a go.xwind.io-lesence-2025. Uh, I have a few minutes left for more questions, but few minutes left for more questions, but few minutes left for more questions, but I want to first of all thank you all for I want to first of all thank you all for I want to first of all thank you all for your time and your heartbeats. uh I have your time and your heartbeats. uh I have your time and your heartbeats. uh I have the best job in the world working on the best job in the world working on the best job in the world working on this project. I get to meet amazing this project. I get to meet amazing this project. I get to meet amazing people and I'll be around after this people and I'll be around after this people and I'll be around after this talk if anybody wants to talk more talk if anybody wants to talk more talk if anybody wants to talk more beyond the questions. So again, thank beyond the questions. So again, thank beyond the questions. So again, thank you very much. So we have a few minutes for much. So we have a few minutes for much. So we have a few minutes for questions, right? We've got a whopping questions, right? We've got a whopping questions, right? We've got a whopping five minutes. Great. Any five minutes. Great. Any five minutes. Great. Any questions? That was easy. You're questions? That was easy. You're questions? That was easy. You're stunned. No, you don't. Not you. Sorry. stunned. No, you don't. Not you. Sorry. stunned. No, you don't. Not you. Sorry. I was Okay, go ahead. Here. Have a mic. What is the current status? What is the current status? What is the current status? So there the idea of a of a fire So there the idea of a of a fire So there the idea of a of a fire department's been kicking around for uh department's been kicking around for uh department's been kicking around for uh a couple years from the openf. Is that a couple years from the openf. Is that a couple years from the openf. Is that gone anywhere? Is that is that something gone anywhere? Is that is that something gone anywhere? Is that is that something that Alpha Omega would fund? What's the that Alpha Omega would fund? What's the that Alpha Omega would fund? What's the plan there? So a few years ago the open plan there? So a few years ago the open plan there? So a few years ago the open SSF uh wrote up a proposal for an open SSF uh wrote up a proposal for an open SSF uh wrote up a proposal for an open source of some kind. Crobe was amazing. source of some kind. Crobe was amazing. source of some kind. Crobe was amazing. Emily Fox was part of that as well. Emily Fox was part of that as well. Emily Fox was part of that as well. it assumed that they were operating it assumed that they were operating it assumed that they were operating enterprise business and could get funded enterprise business and could get funded enterprise business and could get funded with several million dollars a year to with several million dollars a year to with several million dollars a year to start with never having done it before. start with never having done it before. start with never having done it before. Uh and so it didn't have any funding Uh and so it didn't have any funding Uh and so it didn't have any funding from the OpenSSF board because reasons. from the OpenSSF board because reasons. from the OpenSSF board because reasons. Um we are not trying to recreate that Um we are not trying to recreate that Um we are not trying to recreate that business model. We are starting with business model. We are starting with business model. We are starting with very much a very small volunteer very much a very small volunteer very much a very small volunteer conversation and literally all that's conversation and literally all that's conversation and literally all that's happened so far are is one meeting and happened so far are is one meeting and happened so far are is one meeting and we got together and talked about it and we got together and talked about it and we got together and talked about it and people said, "Yep, we should do another people said, "Yep, we should do another people said, "Yep, we should do another meeting." And that's sort of my test for meeting." And that's sort of my test for meeting." And that's sort of my test for success is can we get to the point where success is can we get to the point where success is can we get to the point where people's like we should make this a people's like we should make this a people's like we should make this a regular meeting and we're going to keep regular meeting and we're going to keep regular meeting and we're going to keep figuring out what we're going to do and figuring out what we're going to do and figuring out what we're going to do and how we're going to start it. We're going how we're going to start it. We're going how we're going to start it. We're going to start very small. We are not going to to start very small. We are not going to to start very small. We are not going to be the 800 line for a corporation asking be the 800 line for a corporation asking be the 800 line for a corporation asking for help, right? We're not even going to for help, right? We're not even going to for help, right? We're not even going to be the 800 line the hotline for all open be the 800 line the hotline for all open be the 800 line the hotline for all open source projects in any one ecosystem. source projects in any one ecosystem. source projects in any one ecosystem. We're going to start very small and We're going to start very small and We're going to start very small and learn about what to do there. You have a learn about what to do there. You have a learn about what to do there. You have a question. question. question. Okay. Okay. Okay. Oh, I wish. Uh I'm still looking for Oh, I wish. Uh I'm still looking for Oh, I wish. Uh I'm still looking for that myself. But as Red Hat as a root that myself. But as Red Hat as a root that myself. But as Red Hat as a root and a CLR, part of what we're trying to and a CLR, part of what we're trying to and a CLR, part of what we're trying to do is help with the open source projects do is help with the open source projects do is help with the open source projects upstream who need help and need that upstream who need help and need that upstream who need help and need that assistance. Now, does that mean we can assistance. Now, does that mean we can assistance. Now, does that mean we can do all your instant response for you? do all your instant response for you? do all your instant response for you? No. But we can help with the the CVE and No. But we can help with the the CVE and No. But we can help with the the CVE and the CBD processes. And we've done that a the CBD processes. And we've done that a the CBD processes. And we've done that a lot with using the VIN system. I'm not lot with using the VIN system. I'm not lot with using the VIN system. I'm not I'm not going to call that perfect, but I'm not going to call that perfect, but I'm not going to call that perfect, but it's a matter of getting the right it's a matter of getting the right it's a matter of getting the right projects and people in there and getting projects and people in there and getting projects and people in there and getting them coordinated. So, we've developed them coordinated. So, we've developed them coordinated. So, we've developed that relationship with both SISA JCDC that relationship with both SISA JCDC that relationship with both SISA JCDC uh as well as MITER. So, that's that's uh as well as MITER. So, that's that's uh as well as MITER. So, that's that's what we're trying to do is to support what we're trying to do is to support what we're trying to do is to support notice I didn't say represent to support notice I didn't say represent to support notice I didn't say represent to support open source. All right. Okay. Uh last call for questions. Again, Okay. Uh last call for questions. Again, Okay. Uh last call for questions. Again, thank you so much for your time. I'll be thank you so much for your time. I'll be thank you so much for your time. I'll be around tomorrow as well. Have a nice around tomorrow as well. Have a nice around tomorrow as well. Have a nice day.
