And as part NVD CVE to the OSV format. And as part NVD CVE to the OSV format. And as part of that, I like to be able to eyeball of that, I like to be able to eyeball of that, I like to be able to eyeball large swaths of data because it large swaths of data because it large swaths of data because it sometimes when you just sort things and sometimes when you just sort things and sometimes when you just sort things and look at them at a zoomed out sort of look at them at a zoomed out sort of look at them at a zoomed out sort of level, things jump out at you. level, things jump out at you. level, things jump out at you. Uh, rightly or wrongly, I find Uh, rightly or wrongly, I find Uh, rightly or wrongly, I find spreadsheets a convenient hammer for for spreadsheets a convenient hammer for for spreadsheets a convenient hammer for for that job. Uh, because it's very easy to that job. Uh, because it's very easy to that job.

Um, how are you all doing things today Um, how are you all doing things today Um, how are you all doing things today currently? Uh like like who is doing currently? Uh like like who is doing currently? Uh like like who is doing vulnerability management by spreadsheet vulnerability management by spreadsheet vulnerability management by spreadsheet currently? Don't be shy. Yeah. What are you here for? Be better. Better spreadsheets. You might you might like spreadsheets. You might you might like spreadsheets. You might you might like this. So what are we going to learn this. So what are we going to learn this. So what are we going to learn today? Uh I'm going to show you I'm today? Uh I'm going to show you I'm today? Uh I'm going to show you I'm going to walk you through everything so going to walk you through everything so going to walk you through everything so that you can do for yourself what what that you can do for yourself what what that you can do for yourself what what we do today. I the goal here is to have we do today. I the goal here is to have we do today. I the goal here is to have zero dependencies on anything that I zero dependencies on anything that I zero dependencies on anything that I have prepared earlier. Uh I want you all have prepared earlier. Uh I want you all have prepared earlier. Uh I want you all to be able to operate to be able to operate to be able to operate independently. Uh but you can cheat and independently. Uh but you can cheat and independently. Uh but you can cheat and steal stuff that I'm putting up as well steal stuff that I'm putting up as well steal stuff that I'm putting up as well if you don't want to. But I'm going to if you don't want to. But I'm going to if you don't want to. But I'm going to show you how to make the sausage from show you how to make the sausage from show you how to make the sausage from scratch. Or as we would say at Google, scratch. Or as we would say at Google, scratch. Or as we would say at Google, we reinvented the wheel and we we reinvented the wheel and we we reinvented the wheel and we vulcanized our own rubber. vulcanized our own rubber. vulcanized our own rubber. Um, so there is an existing Um, so there is an existing Um, so there is an existing off-the-shelf solution out there, uh, a off-the-shelf solution out there, uh, a off-the-shelf solution out there, uh, a bunch of appcript that already exists bunch of appcript that already exists bunch of appcript that already exists called import JSON. So we'll I'll I'll called import JSON. So we'll I'll I'll called import JSON. So we'll I'll I'll introduce you to that if you're not introduce you to that if you're not introduce you to that if you're not already familiar with it. We will already familiar with it. We will already familiar with it. We will briefly talk about a bunch of the JSON briefly talk about a bunch of the JSON briefly talk about a bunch of the JSON REST APIs that are available for REST APIs that are available for REST APIs that are available for grabbing vulnerability metadata. Uh grabbing vulnerability metadata. Uh grabbing vulnerability metadata. Uh we'll go through four of my my favorite we'll go through four of my my favorite we'll go through four of my my favorite ones and uh we will make a ones and uh we will make a ones and uh we will make a template that gloms everything together template that gloms everything together template that gloms everything together so that you do all of this grunge work so that you do all of this grunge work so that you do all of this grunge work once and then you can leverage that once and then you can leverage that once and then you can leverage that template template template uh as much and as often as you want for uh as much and as often as you want for uh as much and as often as you want for whatever scratches your whatever scratches your whatever scratches your itch and yeah we'll pull it all together itch and yeah we'll pull it all together itch and yeah we'll pull it all together with a Google sheet. Why would you want with a Google sheet. Why would you want with a Google sheet. Why would you want to be able to do this? Why not? So what to be able to do this? Why not? So what to be able to do this? Why not? So what I the reason you said so the the reason I the reason you said so the the reason I the reason you said so the the reason I wanted to do this was I would get I wanted to do this was I would get I wanted to do this was I would get random lists of CVE ids and I'd want to random lists of CVE ids and I'd want to random lists of CVE ids and I'd want to know things about them right like I'd know things about them right like I'd know things about them right like I'd want to know which CNA made them. I'd want to know which CNA made them. I'd want to know which CNA made them. I'd want to want to want to know what they were all sort of stuff know what they were all sort of stuff know what they were all sort of stuff like that. Uh so so you know this is for like that. Uh so so you know this is for like that. Uh so so you know this is for your quick and dirty vulnerability your quick and dirty vulnerability your quick and dirty vulnerability management by spreadsheet which sounds management by spreadsheet which sounds management by spreadsheet which sounds like we're all doing in different like we're all doing in different like we're all doing in different degrees visual inspection tabular degrees visual inspection tabular degrees visual inspection tabular filtering pivot filtering pivot filtering pivot tables all stuff. So in order to do tables all stuff. So in order to do tables all stuff. So in order to do stuff today if you want to play along at stuff today if you want to play along at stuff today if you want to play along at home with your wacky copy uh you will home with your wacky copy uh you will home with your wacky copy uh you will need a Google account of some flavor. need a Google account of some flavor. need a Google account of some flavor. We got a problem. We got a problem. We got a problem. Sharing the wrong sharing my notes. Yes. Sharing the wrong sharing my notes. Yes. Sharing the wrong sharing my notes. Yes. Well, that's no fun. We got to know Well, that's no fun. We got to know Well, that's no fun. We got to know what's going on. Where is the Zoom? That's me. Screen That's me. Screen That's me. Screen 28. That's better. Sorry about Sorry about Sorry about that. It's all good. We're all awake that. It's all good. We're all awake that. It's all good. We're all awake now. Uh yeah, so if you want to if you now. Uh yeah, so if you want to if you now. Uh yeah, so if you want to if you want to participate live in the want to participate live in the want to participate live in the audience, uh you'll you'll need some audience, uh you'll you'll need some audience, uh you'll you'll need some sort of a Gmail account or workspace sort of a Gmail account or workspace sort of a Gmail account or workspace account, internet access, which I think account, internet access, which I think account, internet access, which I think we've got sorted. And uh I'll also talk we've got sorted. And uh I'll also talk we've got sorted. And uh I'll also talk you through a browser extension that I you through a browser extension that I you through a browser extension that I find in Chrome at least makes the JSON find in Chrome at least makes the JSON find in Chrome at least makes the JSON output look a little bit more output look a little bit more output look a little bit more friendly. So firstly, this browser friendly. So firstly, this browser friendly. So firstly, this browser extension if you want to throw that on extension if you want to throw that on extension if you want to throw that on if you don't already have it. Uh it's if you don't already have it. Uh it's if you don't already have it. Uh it's available for whatever your favorite available for whatever your favorite available for whatever your favorite browser may or may not be. Uh, I like it browser may or may not be. Uh, I like it browser may or may not be. Uh, I like it because it renders the the JSON in more because it renders the the JSON in more because it renders the the JSON in more human friendly human friendly human friendly ways if it comes out in different ways if it comes out in different ways if it comes out in different formats in the browser. So, you can formats in the browser. So, you can formats in the browser. So, you can throw that one on. Uh, looks like that throw that one on. Uh, looks like that throw that one on. Uh, looks like that if you're in the Chrome web store. And we've got, as I said, we've store. And we've got, as I said, we've store. And we've got, as I said, we've got 90 got 90 got 90 minutes. My goal is for this to be minutes. My goal is for this to be minutes. My goal is for this to be interactive. So, you know, I will start interactive. So, you know, I will start interactive. So, you know, I will start subjecting you to my famous dad jokes if subjecting you to my famous dad jokes if subjecting you to my famous dad jokes if we don't get some get some activity or we don't get some get some activity or we don't get some get some activity or we'll just finish early and we can go we'll just finish early and we can go we'll just finish early and we can go and bug the uh the people in the vendor and bug the uh the people in the vendor and bug the uh the people in the vendor room. Um, but yeah, I'm going to do some room. Um, but yeah, I'm going to do some room. Um, but yeah, I'm going to do some stuff. I'll talk you through what we're stuff. I'll talk you through what we're stuff. I'll talk you through what we're going to do. You can then I can then going to do. You can then I can then going to do. You can then I can then potentially demonstrate it and then you potentially demonstrate it and then you potentially demonstrate it and then you can do it together if you want and then can do it together if you want and then can do it together if you want and then we'll do that. And you can stop me at we'll do that. And you can stop me at we'll do that. And you can stop me at any time. As I like to say, there are no any time. As I like to say, there are no any time. As I like to say, there are no stupid questions. this is just my poor stupid questions. this is just my poor stupid questions. this is just my poor job of explaining it or non-existent job of explaining it or non-existent job of explaining it or non-existent documentation or something and yeah we documentation or something and yeah we documentation or something and yeah we can we can talk through some some use can we can talk through some some use can we can talk through some some use cases from the floor as well like I'm cases from the floor as well like I'm cases from the floor as well like I'm totally work you know when when I got totally work you know when when I got totally work you know when when I got told workshop format I'm like cool this told workshop format I'm like cool this told workshop format I'm like cool this is different from the presentation so I is different from the presentation so I is different from the presentation so I don't want to be here talking the whole don't want to be here talking the whole don't want to be here talking the whole time and I would very much appreciate time and I would very much appreciate time and I would very much appreciate feedback on feedback on feedback on this good bad or indifferent afterwards this good bad or indifferent afterwards this good bad or indifferent afterwards so that if I do another workshop again I so that if I do another workshop again I so that if I do another workshop again I can do it can do it can do it better. Okay, so better. Okay, so better. Okay, so uh firstly there's this cool thing uh firstly there's this cool thing uh firstly there's this cool thing called import called import called import JSON. Anyone not heard of this already? JSON. Anyone not heard of this already? JSON. Anyone not heard of this already? Is this is this new to Is this is this new to Is this is this new to anybody? Um in fact we don't we won't anybody? Um in fact we don't we won't anybody? Um in fact we don't we won't have to talk too much about then if you have to talk too much about then if you have to talk too much about then if you already know it. Uh it was I believe already know it. Uh it was I believe already know it. Uh it was I believe based on my archaeology started off by based on my archaeology started off by based on my archaeology started off by this Trevor chap uh and then Brad took this Trevor chap uh and then Brad took this Trevor chap uh and then Brad took it over it over it over and that's kind of where it's at today. and that's kind of where it's at today. and that's kind of where it's at today. So it will give you if you add that into So it will give you if you add that into So it will give you if you add that into a the app script for a Google sheet that a the app script for a Google sheet that a the app script for a Google sheet that will give you this set of functions will give you this set of functions will give you this set of functions here. I usually only play around with here. I usually only play around with here. I usually only play around with the the import JSON one, but the the import JSON one, but the the import JSON one, but um depending on what your use case is, um depending on what your use case is, um depending on what your use case is, you can also use the the other you can also use the the other you can also use the the other variations of this as well. Uh I' I' variations of this as well. Uh I' I' variations of this as well. Uh I' I' I've personally not had a need to, but I I've personally not had a need to, but I I've personally not had a need to, but I can appreciate uh reasons why you would can appreciate uh reasons why you would can appreciate uh reasons why you would need either the the post one or the need either the the post one or the need either the the post one or the advanced one lets you do um extra advanced one lets you do um extra advanced one lets you do um extra headers and stuff like that, which would headers and stuff like that, which would headers and stuff like that, which would come in handy in particular for the NVD come in handy in particular for the NVD come in handy in particular for the NVD if you wanted to feed an API key to it if you wanted to feed an API key to it if you wanted to feed an API key to it for a better rate limiting situation. for a better rate limiting situation. for a better rate limiting situation. But yeah, for from for my for my But yeah, for from for my for my But yeah, for from for my for my applications today gone away pretty applications today gone away pretty applications today gone away pretty successfully with just the the standard successfully with just the the standard successfully with just the the standard import JSON import JSON import JSON one. So the catch is that Brad for one. So the catch is that Brad for one. So the catch is that Brad for whatever reason has sort of parked this whatever reason has sort of parked this whatever reason has sort of parked this effort. Uh the the repo is archived. effort. Uh the the repo is archived. effort. Uh the the repo is archived. It's it's still there. You can still It's it's still there. You can still It's it's still there. You can still grab the stuff. I would highly grab the stuff. I would highly grab the stuff. I would highly recommend forking it so that if it went recommend forking it so that if it went recommend forking it so that if it went poof in the future, you have a copy of poof in the future, you have a copy of poof in the future, you have a copy of what's there. Uh I would also highly what's there. Uh I would also highly what's there. Uh I would also highly recommend that if anybody wants to take recommend that if anybody wants to take recommend that if anybody wants to take it over because he's basically said when it over because he's basically said when it over because he's basically said when he archives it, you know, you want to he archives it, you know, you want to he archives it, you know, you want to take it, take it over, talk to me. Just take it, take it over, talk to me. Just take it, take it over, talk to me. Just don't do something like npm and, you don't do something like npm and, you don't do something like npm and, you know, take it over and turn it into know, take it over and turn it into know, take it over and turn it into something hostile. That would be very something hostile. That would be very something hostile. That would be very uncool. uncool. uncool. Uh yeah, I might now that I've got a bit Uh yeah, I might now that I've got a bit Uh yeah, I might now that I've got a bit more spare time uh explore taking it more spare time uh explore taking it more spare time uh explore taking it over, but I also potentially have less over, but I also potentially have less over, but I also potentially have less of a day-to-day need for it going of a day-to-day need for it going of a day-to-day need for it going forward. So, we'll forward. So, we'll forward. So, we'll see. Um but yeah, it's it's it's as in terms of bugs obviously it's as in terms of bugs obviously it's as in terms of bugs obviously because it's frozen. So, if you go I because it's frozen. So, if you go I because it's frozen. So, if you go I think the issue tracker's got order of think the issue tracker's got order of think the issue tracker's got order of 100 or 100 plus bugs in it. I don't I 100 or 100 plus bugs in it. I don't I 100 or 100 plus bugs in it. I don't I haven't looked at them uh to see how haven't looked at them uh to see how haven't looked at them uh to see how egregious some of them are in terms of egregious some of them are in terms of egregious some of them are in terms of functionality gaps, but you know, it's functionality gaps, but you know, it's functionality gaps, but you know, it's got got got bugs. So, the first thing we're going to bugs. So, the first thing we're going to bugs. So, the first thing we're going to do is um who who does want to follow do is um who who does want to follow do is um who who does want to follow along at home here? Just so I get a along at home here? Just so I get a along at home here? Just so I get a sense of where you're all going to sit sense of where you're all going to sit sense of where you're all going to sit here. Yeah, cool. Um then then we will here. Yeah, cool. Um then then we will here. Yeah, cool. Um then then we will we will do that. I will happily run to we will do that. I will happily run to we will do that. I will happily run to the lowest common denominator for the lowest common denominator for the lowest common denominator for participation. participation. participation. Um, I can talk you through this. I can Um, I can talk you through this. I can Um, I can talk you through this. I can have an attempt at demonstrating this. have an attempt at demonstrating this. have an attempt at demonstrating this. The challenge is this is not my laptop, The challenge is this is not my laptop, The challenge is this is not my laptop, so I'm not logged in as me, so it's a so I'm not logged in as me, so it's a so I'm not logged in as me, so it's a little bit hard to demo demo. Um, but um little bit hard to demo demo. Um, but um little bit hard to demo demo. Um, but um hopefully for for at least you down the hopefully for for at least you down the hopefully for for at least you down the back there that's following back there that's following back there that's following along, don't be shy about yelling out if along, don't be shy about yelling out if along, don't be shy about yelling out if any of this is confusing, please. Uh, so any of this is confusing, please. Uh, so any of this is confusing, please. Uh, so step one is you pull up the the the step one is you pull up the the the step one is you pull up the the the appcript code and you essentially copy appcript code and you essentially copy appcript code and you essentially copy it and paste it into a brand new it and paste it into a brand new it and paste it into a brand new spreadsheet by pulling up the um the app spreadsheet by pulling up the um the app spreadsheet by pulling up the um the app script for it. script for it. script for it. So hopefully that's self-explanatory. Um, I can do this with my eyes closed, Um, I can do this with my eyes closed, Um, I can do this with my eyes closed, so it doesn't take very long, but if you so it doesn't take very long, but if you so it doesn't take very long, but if you haven't done this on the regular, it haven't done this on the regular, it haven't done this on the regular, it might take a little bit might take a little bit might take a little bit longer. And then the nice thing about Do longer. And then the nice thing about Do longer. And then the nice thing about Do you have a question? So, the question was, why would you want So, the question was, why would you want So, the question was, why would you want to do this? Uh, the why is is broad. to do this? Uh, the why is is broad. to do this? Uh, the why is is broad. Uh historically my why has been I have a Uh historically my why has been I have a Uh historically my why has been I have a bunch of CVE bunch of CVE bunch of CVE ids. I want to get live information ids. I want to get live information ids. I want to get live information about about about them from one of these online data them from one of these online data them from one of these online data sources. So sources. So sources. So historically one of the things I was historically one of the things I was historically one of the things I was interested in knowing was who was the interested in knowing was who was the interested in knowing was who was the CNA for a given CVE record or what was CNA for a given CVE record or what was CNA for a given CVE record or what was its status in the NBD? Was it analyzed? its status in the NBD? Was it analyzed? its status in the NBD? Was it analyzed? Was it pending an analysis? That kind of Was it pending an analysis? That kind of Was it pending an analysis? That kind of a thing. That's that's one of my common a thing. That's that's one of my common a thing. That's that's one of my common common use cases. But if you're doing common use cases. But if you're doing common use cases. But if you're doing this for more of a vulnerability this for more of a vulnerability this for more of a vulnerability management sort of management sort of management sort of situation and let's say you've run a situation and let's say you've run a situation and let's say you've run a scan and you've got back a list of CVE scan and you've got back a list of CVE scan and you've got back a list of CVE IDs and then you want to know some IDs and then you want to know some IDs and then you want to know some things about them for prioritization things about them for prioritization things about them for prioritization purposes or incident response purpose purposes or incident response purpose purposes or incident response purpose some some sort of incident response some some sort of incident response some some sort of incident response purpose. You might want to get the purpose. You might want to get the purpose. You might want to get the descriptions. You might want to get the descriptions. You might want to get the descriptions. You might want to get the CBSS scores. You might want to get the CBSS scores. You might want to get the CBSS scores. You might want to get the C.W. C.W. C.W. for them, that sort of thing. So, it's for them, that sort of thing. So, it's for them, that sort of thing. So, it's any aspect of the metadata that's any aspect of the metadata that's any aspect of the metadata that's available to you about those CVS you available to you about those CVS you available to you about those CVS you might want to pull into a spreadsheet so might want to pull into a spreadsheet so might want to pull into a spreadsheet so that you can then sort them, group them, that you can then sort them, group them, that you can then sort them, group them, filter them, pivot table them, anything filter them, pivot table them, anything filter them, pivot table them, anything like that. Is that You're welcome. Thank like that. Is that You're welcome. Thank like that. Is that You're welcome. Thank you for the question. How are we doing you for the question. How are we doing you for the question. How are we doing with the people that are following along with the people that are following along with the people that are following along at home? Are we we are we good? We got at home? Are we we are we good? We got at home? Are we we are we good? We got questions. We got questions. We got questions. We got confusion. More coffee required. Are we cool to move required. Are we cool to move required. Are we cool to move on? Going once, going twice, moving on. on? Going once, going twice, moving on. on? Going once, going twice, moving on. So now, if you don't want to have them So now, if you don't want to have them So now, if you don't want to have them fool around. Um, how did you respond to the flubble that how did you respond to the flubble that how did you respond to the flubble that was going on with MVD in the last year? was going on with MVD in the last year? was going on with MVD in the last year? Oh, this this is a this is more of a Oh, this this is a this is more of a Oh, this this is a this is more of a question about the the conversion work question about the the conversion work question about the the conversion work that that I was doing. it was impacted that that I was doing. it was impacted that that I was doing. it was impacted by it basically. So um yeah I can I can by it basically. So um yeah I can I can by it basically. So um yeah I can I can talk about that at length. talk about that at length. talk about that at length. Uh I wrote some code to convert from the Uh I wrote some code to convert from the Uh I wrote some code to convert from the MBD data. It as a last resort relies on MBD data. It as a last resort relies on MBD data. It as a last resort relies on the reference information only. So if the reference information only. So if the reference information only. So if there's no CPE information in a in an there's no CPE information in a in an there's no CPE information in a in an NVD record, but there is a useful NVD record, but there is a useful NVD record, but there is a useful reference URL, it will resort to that. reference URL, it will resort to that. reference URL, it will resort to that. But um yeah, there's a noticeable sort But um yeah, there's a noticeable sort But um yeah, there's a noticeable sort of dip in the conversion rates for data of dip in the conversion rates for data of dip in the conversion rates for data from 2024 from 2024 from 2024 onwards, unfortunately. And we're well onwards, unfortunately. And we're well onwards, unfortunately. And we're well when I say we my team that I'm no longer when I say we my team that I'm no longer when I say we my team that I'm no longer on uh is looking at using CVE list on uh is looking at using CVE list on uh is looking at using CVE list data in addition to ABD data this year data in addition to ABD data this year data in addition to ABD data this year to sort of expand what what is to sort of expand what what is to sort of expand what what is potentially convertible. But that is a potentially convertible. But that is a potentially convertible. But that is a whole different can of worms which I whole different can of worms which I whole different can of worms which I will be touching on in my my talk on will be touching on in my my talk on will be touching on in my my talk on Wednesday. So come along to that one and Wednesday. So come along to that one and Wednesday. So come along to that one and watch me ride around on my hobby watch me ride around on my hobby watch me ride around on my hobby horse. Um yeah. So if you want to grab horse. Um yeah. So if you want to grab horse. Um yeah. So if you want to grab my template, but this comes back to the my template, but this comes back to the my template, but this comes back to the I'd rather you be completely independent I'd rather you be completely independent I'd rather you be completely independent of me because then you know the S sur in of me because then you know the S sur in of me because then you know the S sur in me would rather you be independent of me would rather you be independent of me would rather you be independent of me. uh you can take my template that me. uh you can take my template that me. uh you can take my template that I've created following the step on this I've created following the step on this I've created following the step on this slide uh and use that to create your own slide uh and use that to create your own slide uh and use that to create your own spreadsheet which you could essentially spreadsheet which you could essentially spreadsheet which you could essentially then just make another template from and then just make another template from and then just make another template from and you've done all the work or not had to you've done all the work or not had to you've done all the work or not had to do all the work. Uh, and I've got a a do all the work. Uh, and I've got a a do all the work. Uh, and I've got a a tiny URL link there as well for that tiny URL link there as well for that tiny URL link there as well for that one. That is an JGS template if the one. That is an JGS template if the one. That is an JGS template if the rendering slides a little bit ambiguous rendering slides a little bit ambiguous rendering slides a little bit ambiguous as in import JSON Google sheet template. as in import JSON Google sheet template. as in import JSON Google sheet template. Uh, and then what I've done as well, Uh, and then what I've done as well, Uh, and then what I've done as well, which we can sort of muck around with which we can sort of muck around with which we can sort of muck around with maybe for demonstration purposes, is maybe for demonstration purposes, is maybe for demonstration purposes, is I've made a little playground one as I've made a little playground one as I've made a little playground one as well, which to to your question, ma'am, well, which to to your question, ma'am, well, which to to your question, ma'am, uh, about why would you do this or what uh, about why would you do this or what uh, about why would you do this or what would you do with it, I can show you a would you do with it, I can show you a would you do with it, I can show you a worked example. So, bear with me for a worked example. So, bear with me for a worked example. So, bear with me for a moment while we try and convince the moment while we try and convince the moment while we try and convince the demo gods to cooperate. So in So in So in theory I throw this. Ah not do what I wanted it to do. All right. So this is the this is do. All right. So this is the this is do. All right. So this is the this is the um playground that I cooked up. I just want to fix this back up for a I just want to fix this back up for a I just want to fix this back up for a sec. All right, there we go. Um, yeah. sec. All right, there we go. Um, yeah. sec. All right, there we go. Um, yeah. So, so this is a a sort of a a more of a So, so this is a a sort of a a more of a So, so this is a a sort of a a more of a worked demo. Stand over here so I can worked demo. Stand over here so I can worked demo. Stand over here so I can see what I'm looking at. see what I'm looking at. see what I'm looking at. Um, here we go. So, what I've done here Um, here we go. So, what I've done here Um, here we go. So, what I've done here is couple of basic ones. So, I picked a is couple of basic ones. So, I picked a is couple of basic ones. So, I picked a bunch of bunch of bunch of CVES and I just wanted to pull the the CVES and I just wanted to pull the the CVES and I just wanted to pull the the CNA for them and the description for CNA for them and the description for CNA for them and the description for them. And so, this is them. And so, this is them. And so, this is coming live coming live coming live from the CVE list from the CVE list from the CVE list API. So, does anybody have a favorite API. So, does anybody have a favorite API. So, does anybody have a favorite CVE? Does anybody have anything that has CVE? Does anybody have anything that has CVE? Does anybody have anything that has caused them grief in the caused them grief in the caused them grief in the last week? I can do a little live demonstration. What was demonstration. What was demonstration. What was that? What's it number? Pick a CD. Any CD. number? Pick a CD. Any CD. number? Pick a CD. Any CD. 1974 from 1974 from 1974 from 205 was a very good year. So if we were 205 was a very good year. So if we were 205 was a very good year. So if we were to do this, boom. to do this, boom. to do this, boom. So that just pulled it live from the So that just pulled it live from the So that just pulled it live from the API. So that's why you'd want to do that. Um, and then this is another one that. Um, and then this is another one that. Um, and then this is another one here where it's just talking to the NBD. here where it's just talking to the NBD. here where it's just talking to the NBD. So we could do the same thing here and go do that. Shame, right? So you get the that. Shame, right? So you get the that. Shame, right? So you get the idea. Uh and then this one is a bit bit idea. Uh and then this one is a bit bit idea. Uh and then this one is a bit bit more special. Uh this one is pulling more special. Uh this one is pulling more special. Uh this one is pulling the the CW uh CDSS squat just the the um the the CW uh CDSS squat just the the um the the CW uh CDSS squat just the the um the base severity squat from the CV the base severity squat from the CV the base severity squat from the CV list. So again, let's see how this one performs. That I've had to put this into performs. That I've had to put this into performs. That I've had to put this into two cells because of reasons I'll talk two cells because of reasons I'll talk two cells because of reasons I'll talk about in a minute. Critical. Cool. Uh about in a minute. Critical. Cool. Uh about in a minute. Critical. Cool. Uh and then I think this one's bonkers and then I think this one's bonkers and then I think this one's bonkers advanced. This one attempts to pull the advanced. This one attempts to pull the advanced. This one attempts to pull the vendors and products out of the vendors and products out of the vendors and products out of the CD list CD sign guys can't type Andrew I'm copying the formula from the cell I'm copying the formula from the cell I'm copying the formula from the cell above above above down. So, sorry. And the question for anybody So, sorry. And the question for anybody So, sorry. And the question for anybody that didn't catch that one was, "Am I that didn't catch that one was, "Am I that didn't catch that one was, "Am I the question was am I just moving off the question was am I just moving off the question was am I just moving off the cell?" I said, "No, I am the cell?" I said, "No, I am the cell?" I said, "No, I am um copying the copy the formula down." um copying the copy the formula down." um copying the copy the formula down." Sorry, that had a really big one. Google Sheets caches the inputs going Google Sheets caches the inputs going Google Sheets caches the inputs going into the formula and then it'll recmp into the formula and then it'll recmp into the formula and then it'll recmp compute uh if you change the inputs make compute uh if you change the inputs make compute uh if you change the inputs make it'll redo redo the appcript call to get it'll redo redo the appcript call to get it'll redo redo the appcript call to get the external thing but if it's just the the external thing but if it's just the the external thing but if it's just the same input it's not going to redo it same input it's not going to redo it same input it's not going to redo it unnaturally there'll be a few edge cases unnaturally there'll be a few edge cases unnaturally there'll be a few edge cases but yeah and it's a new cell so it'll but yeah and it's a new cell so it'll but yeah and it's a new cell so it'll recmp compute or reinvoke as well yeah I recmp compute or reinvoke as well yeah I recmp compute or reinvoke as well yeah I did a fill down so I selected the cell did a fill down so I selected the cell did a fill down so I selected the cell above and I hit control D which is the above and I hit control D which is the above and I hit control D which is the same thing as grabbing the little corner same thing as grabbing the little corner same thing as grabbing the little corner dubry and pulling it down. Um, I'm a dubry and pulling it down. Um, I'm a dubry and pulling it down. Um, I'm a shortcut kind of guy. And shortcut kind of guy. And shortcut kind of guy. And uh, uh, uh, so this so this so this one, wait, this one. So, this one sounds like it's one. So, this one sounds like it's one. So, this one sounds like it's pulled the product out, but wasn't pulled the product out, but wasn't pulled the product out, but wasn't success. Sorry, pulled the vendor out. success. Sorry, pulled the vendor out. success. Sorry, pulled the vendor out. Hasn't successfully pulled the product Hasn't successfully pulled the product Hasn't successfully pulled the product out. But yeah, out. But yeah, out. But yeah, um, you get the drill um, you get the drill um, you get the drill hopefully. Does that excite anybody? You hopefully. Does that excite anybody? You hopefully. Does that excite anybody? You excited me the first time I did it. I excited me the first time I did it. I excited me the first time I did it. I was like, was like, was like, get live get live get live data. Um, so we come back to my data. Um, so we come back to my data. Um, so we come back to my slides. Yes. Yeah. Um, the question was how big Yes. Yeah. Um, the question was how big Yes. Yeah. Um, the question was how big do you get it because of you know growth do you get it because of you know growth do you get it because of you know growth and performance and stuff like that. and performance and stuff like that. and performance and stuff like that. There's a few different caveats based on There's a few different caveats based on There's a few different caveats based on uh which APIs you end up talking to in uh which APIs you end up talking to in uh which APIs you end up talking to in terms of rate limits and whatnot. terms of rate limits and whatnot. terms of rate limits and whatnot. I've also found that, you know, I've also found that, you know, I've also found that, you know, eventually get to a point where the eventually get to a point where the eventually get to a point where the where Google Sheets kind of chokes a bit where Google Sheets kind of chokes a bit where Google Sheets kind of chokes a bit with the with the scale of it. with the with the scale of it. with the with the scale of it.

I have never does have a rate limit. I have never does have a rate limit. I have never bothered to make import JSON use an API bothered to make import JSON use an API bothered to make import JSON use an API key. But as part of putting this key. But as part of putting this key. But as part of putting this together, I looked at how that would together, I looked at how that would together, I looked at how that would work and it looks like and the way that work and it looks like and the way that work and it looks like and the way that you use their API key with their API is you use their API key with their API is you use their API key with their API is you have to add a HTTP header with the you have to add a HTTP header with the you have to add a HTTP header with the API key in there. From the looks of it API key in there. From the looks of it API key in there. From the looks of it using um the import JSON advanced using um the import JSON advanced using um the import JSON advanced function, it will support doing that. Uh function, it will support doing that. Uh function, it will support doing that. Uh I ran out of time to actually prove I ran out of time to actually prove I ran out of time to actually prove that. So that that is still a that. So that that is still a that. So that that is still a theoretical exercise for a reader, but theoretical exercise for a reader, but theoretical exercise for a reader, but um I'll I'll come back and talk um I'll I'll come back and talk um I'll I'll come back and talk about how you deal with running into the about how you deal with running into the about how you deal with running into the MBD's rate limit anyway. MBD's rate limit anyway. MBD's rate limit anyway. Um OSV.dev does not have a rate limit. Um OSV.dev does not have a rate limit. Um OSV.dev does not have a rate limit. Uh it's going to have whatever is Uh it's going to have whatever is Uh it's going to have whatever is available in OSV.dev, which will be a available in OSV.dev, which will be a available in OSV.dev, which will be a subset of CVE. So if it's CVES in subset of CVE. So if it's CVES in subset of CVE. So if it's CVES in particular that you're after, then your particular that you're after, then your particular that you're after, then your mileage will vary there. And the lovely mileage will vary there. And the lovely mileage will vary there. And the lovely lovely GitHub advisory database has an lovely GitHub advisory database has an lovely GitHub advisory database has an API as well. And it does have various API as well. And it does have various API as well. And it does have various rate limits on it. Uh Madison, do you rate limits on it. Uh Madison, do you rate limits on it. Uh Madison, do you remember how one authenticates to that remember how one authenticates to that remember how one authenticates to that one? I'm guessing there's a one? I'm guessing there's a one? I'm guessing there's a key. Yeah, I don't remember either. Like key. Yeah, I don't remember either. Like key. Yeah, I don't remember either. Like I I' I've actually I I' I've actually I I' I've actually not given it to Windsor. So um you've not given it to Windsor. So um you've not given it to Windsor. So um you've wandered down the import JSON path. wandered down the import JSON path. wandered down the import JSON path. There's a library if you wander into There's a library if you wander into There's a library if you wander into like APIs that need more keys and ooth like APIs that need more keys and ooth like APIs that need more keys and ooth and stuff like that. Eric Kolita and stuff like that. Eric Kolita and stuff like that. Eric Kolita formerly of Google has a great library formerly of Google has a great library formerly of Google has a great library for doing ooth uh connections from for doing ooth uh connections from for doing ooth uh connections from appcript into any other API you want. appcript into any other API you want. appcript into any other API you want. And so maybe that's a path you could And so maybe that's a path you could And so maybe that's a path you could look at as well. Yeah. Okay. look at as well. Yeah. Okay. look at as well. Yeah. Okay. I won't try and repeat that one because I won't try and repeat that one because I won't try and repeat that one because microphone so it's all good. Uh yeah. microphone so it's all good. Uh yeah. microphone so it's all good. Uh yeah. Yeah. So, so the these are these are a Yeah. So, so the these are these are a Yeah. So, so the these are these are a bunch of different JSON APIs that would, bunch of different JSON APIs that would, bunch of different JSON APIs that would, you know, you can feed a vulnerability you know, you can feed a vulnerability you know, you can feed a vulnerability ID to and get back structured metadata ID to and get back structured metadata ID to and get back structured metadata of some sort and then you can then sort of some sort and then you can then sort of some sort and then you can then sort of poke at that with with import of poke at that with with import of poke at that with with import JSON. So, the other thing that I like to JSON. So, the other thing that I like to JSON. So, the other thing that I like to do because, you know, basically all I do do because, you know, basically all I do do because, you know, basically all I do all day is look at the JSON metadata for all day is look at the JSON metadata for all day is look at the JSON metadata for for vulnerability records is uh in for vulnerability records is uh in for vulnerability records is uh in Chrome and I'm sure you can do this in Chrome and I'm sure you can do this in Chrome and I'm sure you can do this in Firefox as well if you're a Firefox Firefox as well if you're a Firefox Firefox as well if you're a Firefox person uh is you can define custom person uh is you can define custom person uh is you can define custom search engines. search engines. search engines. So, I've got my browser set up so that So, I've got my browser set up so that So, I've got my browser set up so that you can just type in the vulnerability you can just type in the vulnerability you can just type in the vulnerability ecosystem of interest and the a space ecosystem of interest and the a space ecosystem of interest and the a space and the C and then the CVE ID or the and the C and then the CVE ID or the and the C and then the CVE ID or the whatever the vulnerability record ID is whatever the vulnerability record ID is whatever the vulnerability record ID is and and then it will pop out the the and and then it will pop out the the and and then it will pop out the the JSON for JSON for JSON for you. And I kind of jumped ahead to the you. And I kind of jumped ahead to the you. And I kind of jumped ahead to the fun because why not? Um, as I said, this fun because why not? Um, as I said, this fun because why not? Um, as I said, this may not be the right hammer for the job, may not be the right hammer for the job, may not be the right hammer for the job, but it's a fun one. but it's a fun one. but it's a fun one. Sorry. Uh, so the one that I just showed Sorry. Uh, so the one that I just showed Sorry. Uh, so the one that I just showed you live before was, uh, just getting you live before was, uh, just getting you live before was, uh, just getting CVE metadata. So, so this is the this is CVE metadata. So, so this is the this is CVE metadata. So, so this is the this is a function that you shove in the the a function that you shove in the the a function that you shove in the the cell, assuming that you've got your CV cell, assuming that you've got your CV cell, assuming that you've got your CV ID of interest in A2 in this case. And ID of interest in A2 in this case. And ID of interest in A2 in this case. And you give it you give it you give it the the the paths to the fields that the the the paths to the fields that the the the paths to the fields that you're interested in. And I always use you're interested in. And I always use you're interested in. And I always use the no headers one because otherwise it the no headers one because otherwise it the no headers one because otherwise it puts an extra header in there which kind puts an extra header in there which kind puts an extra header in there which kind of mucks up the whole idea of having one of mucks up the whole idea of having one of mucks up the whole idea of having one row per per row per per row per per vulnerability. vulnerability. vulnerability. And as you may have remembered in the in And as you may have remembered in the in And as you may have remembered in the in the live demo that I showed the live demo that I showed the live demo that I showed you, it builds as many cells as you've you, it builds as many cells as you've you, it builds as many cells as you've asked it to. asked it to. asked it to. So in in the in this first demo, it even though I only it even though I only it even though I only had a formula in that cell, it also had a formula in that cell, it also had a formula in that cell, it also flowed into that one. So that's flowed into that one. So that's flowed into that one. So that's something to bear in mind. Uh Google something to bear in mind. Uh Google something to bear in mind. Uh Google Sheets gets a little bit cranky if Sheets gets a little bit cranky if Sheets gets a little bit cranky if you're trying to overwrite things in you're trying to overwrite things in you're trying to overwrite things in other cells or rows. And I'll talk about other cells or rows. And I'll talk about other cells or rows. And I'll talk about arrays in a moment, but arrays in a moment, but arrays in a moment, but um if you end up in a situation where um if you end up in a situation where um if you end up in a situation where you've got a column with CVE ids and you've got a column with CVE ids and you've got a column with CVE ids and therefore you want one row per per therefore you want one row per per therefore you want one row per per record and you ask it for something that record and you ask it for something that record and you ask it for something that is an is an is an array and it's going to then if it would array and it's going to then if it would array and it's going to then if it would clobber the row clobber the row clobber the row below, it won't. people say, "I'm not below, it won't. people say, "I'm not below, it won't. people say, "I'm not going to do that because I would going to do that because I would going to do that because I would overflow into the row below and overflow into the row below and overflow into the row below and no banana for you." So, uh that that's no banana for you." So, uh that that's no banana for you." So, uh that that's something to bear in mind. That that's something to bear in mind. That that's something to bear in mind. That that's where it gets a little bit tricky. So, where it gets a little bit tricky. So, where it gets a little bit tricky. So, so if you ask for too much, you'll so if you ask for too much, you'll so if you ask for too much, you'll you'll get into a situation where it you'll get into a situation where it you'll get into a situation where it doesn't give you what you would like. I played around with named ranges for I played around with named ranges for I played around with named ranges for this as well just so that you don't have this as well just so that you don't have this as well just so that you don't have to. Uh so in this example here where to. Uh so in this example here where to. Uh so in this example here where I've hardcoded the URL in there, what I I've hardcoded the URL in there, what I I've hardcoded the URL in there, what I did for this playground demo is did for this playground demo is did for this playground demo is uh I've put a bunch uh I've put a bunch uh I've put a bunch of constants in here with the the base of constants in here with the the base of constants in here with the the base URLs and then I've created named ranges URLs and then I've created named ranges URLs and then I've created named ranges for those cells. So then if you look for those cells. So then if you look for those cells. So then if you look at the implementation of one of these at the implementation of one of these at the implementation of one of these functions, it's a little bit more functions, it's a little bit more functions, it's a little bit more readable because rather than having the readable because rather than having the readable because rather than having the the URL in there, I've just got the the the URL in there, I've just got the the the URL in there, I've just got the the name CVE in there. And so it just makes name CVE in there. And so it just makes name CVE in there. And so it just makes the formula a little bit shorter and the formula a little bit shorter and the formula a little bit shorter and more concise and a little bit more self-explanatory. Made self-explanatory. Made self-explanatory. Made the zoom thing up here on top of here. I the zoom thing up here on top of here. I the zoom thing up here on top of here. I think I'll get by. think I'll get by. think I'll get by. Um, coming back to my slides uh name ranges. What else? Uh, so this uh name ranges. What else? Uh, so this uh name ranges. What else? Uh, so this will under certain circumstances will under certain circumstances will under certain circumstances recalculate everything which means it recalculate everything which means it recalculate everything which means it will go off and do another API call will go off and do another API call will go off and do another API call which may not be what you need or want which may not be what you need or want which may not be what you need or want once you've got the data. once you don't once you've got the data. once you don't once you've got the data. once you don't need to know that. Sometimes you do like need to know that. Sometimes you do like need to know that. Sometimes you do like obviously for something like the NVD obviously for something like the NVD obviously for something like the NVD status you do want that to refresh from status you do want that to refresh from status you do want that to refresh from time to time. Uh but other times you time to time. Uh but other times you time to time. Uh but other times you just want to do a one and done and then just want to do a one and done and then just want to do a one and done and then keep it. keep it. keep it. So knowing when it's going to do a So knowing when it's going to do a So knowing when it's going to do a recalculation and when it won't is is recalculation and when it won't is is recalculation and when it won't is is helpful for for just sort of managing helpful for for just sort of managing helpful for for just sort of managing both how long your spreadsheets busy both how long your spreadsheets busy both how long your spreadsheets busy thinking and how and how how much API thinking and how and how how much API thinking and how and how how much API quoting you're potentially consuming. Uh quoting you're potentially consuming. Uh quoting you're potentially consuming. Uh the the hot tip is to the the hot tip is to the the hot tip is to basically copy and then paste the value basically copy and then paste the value basically copy and then paste the value back. So if you back. So if you back. So if you copy the the the rows there that had the copy the the the rows there that had the copy the the the rows there that had the the formula on it and then when you the formula on it and then when you the formula on it and then when you paste you can say paste value only and paste you can say paste value only and paste you can say paste value only and then you've overwritten the formula with then you've overwritten the formula with then you've overwritten the formula with the value that the formula returns and the value that the formula returns and the value that the formula returns and then it's it's static at that point. So then it's it's static at that point. So then it's it's static at that point. So so that's that's that's a efficiency so that's that's that's a efficiency so that's that's that's a efficiency consideration. I see a question coming. consideration. I see a question coming. consideration. I see a question coming. Yes sir. So that's the case like if you Yes sir. So that's the case like if you Yes sir. So that's the case like if you wanted to do a daily sheet Mhm. you wanted to do a daily sheet Mhm. you wanted to do a daily sheet Mhm. you could rather than actually copying all could rather than actually copying all could rather than actually copying all the formulas, you just copy all the the formulas, you just copy all the the formulas, you just copy all the values out. Yeah, perfect. Thank you. values out. Yeah, perfect. Thank you. values out. Yeah, perfect. Thank you. Yeah, and that's handy if you want to Yeah, and that's handy if you want to Yeah, and that's handy if you want to snapshot and you want to share that snapshot and you want to share that snapshot and you want to share that snapshot around internally and you don't snapshot around internally and you don't snapshot around internally and you don't want everybody that opens it to want everybody that opens it to want everybody that opens it to potentially recalculate the spreadsheet. potentially recalculate the spreadsheet. potentially recalculate the spreadsheet. Uh Uh Uh so yeah and if you want to trigger a so yeah and if you want to trigger a so yeah and if you want to trigger a recalculation uh what I find is usually recalculation uh what I find is usually recalculation uh what I find is usually the easiest way is to uh delete the the easiest way is to uh delete the the easiest way is to uh delete the values and then just control Z to undo values and then just control Z to undo values and then just control Z to undo the deletion and then that triggers a a the deletion and then that triggers a a the deletion and then that triggers a a recalculation. So uh and this sort of recalculation. So uh and this sort of recalculation. So uh and this sort of feeds into when you wanted to do a feeds into when you wanted to do a feeds into when you wanted to do a recalculation because you've hit say the recalculation because you've hit say the recalculation because you've hit say the NBD's rate limit. Uh what what I do is NBD's rate limit. Uh what what I do is NBD's rate limit. Uh what what I do is like when when you get an error I think like when when you get an error I think like when when you get an error I think it either returns the hash NA or hash it either returns the hash NA or hash it either returns the hash NA or hash error or something like that. You can error or something like that. You can error or something like that. You can filter on that value. So you can filter filter on that value. So you can filter filter on that value. So you can filter all of the the values that are just all of the the values that are just all of the the values that are just erroneous. Do that little delete control erroneous. Do that little delete control erroneous. Do that little delete control Z trick and it will just recalculate Z trick and it will just recalculate Z trick and it will just recalculate those rows. Uh and so you can kind of do those rows. Uh and so you can kind of do those rows. Uh and so you can kind of do that as it's a bit clunky. You can do that as it's a bit clunky. You can do that as it's a bit clunky. You can do that as many times as you need to until that as many times as you need to until that as many times as you need to until it's fetched all the rows that it needed it's fetched all the rows that it needed it's fetched all the rows that it needed to fetch. So that's how I would to fetch. So that's how I would to fetch. So that's how I would obviously if you've got a lot let's say obviously if you've got a lot let's say obviously if you've got a lot let's say you've got tens of thousands and then you've got tens of thousands and then you've got tens of thousands and then you're doing that repeatedly it gets a you're doing that repeatedly it gets a you're doing that repeatedly it gets a little bit old but uh I've got a high little bit old but uh I've got a high little bit old but uh I've got a high pain threshold for some of these things pain threshold for some of these things pain threshold for some of these things because it's easier than you know because it's easier than you know because it's easier than you know dealing with the alternatives. So but dealing with the alternatives. So but dealing with the alternatives. So but but yeah at at that and at that point but yeah at at that and at that point but yeah at at that and at that point copying and pasting the values back so copying and pasting the values back so copying and pasting the values back so they they stay static is usually the way they they stay static is usually the way they they stay static is usually the way to to to go. Uh the the other thing with error go. Uh the the other thing with error go. Uh the the other thing with error checking is coming back to this example checking is coming back to this example checking is coming back to this example here where I've asked it for assign a here where I've asked it for assign a here where I've asked it for assign a short name and descriptions. So you've short name and descriptions. So you've short name and descriptions. So you've got a commaepparated string of paths. got a commaepparated string of paths. got a commaepparated string of paths. That whole thing has to work or the or That whole thing has to work or the or That whole thing has to work or the or it's considered not to have worked. So it's considered not to have worked. So it's considered not to have worked. So sometimes you end up in a situation as sometimes you end up in a situation as sometimes you end up in a situation as for some of these more advanced examples for some of these more advanced examples for some of these more advanced examples in this demo spreadsheet where you end in this demo spreadsheet where you end in this demo spreadsheet where you end up having to have maybe two or three up having to have maybe two or three up having to have maybe two or three import JSON calls per input CVE record import JSON calls per input CVE record import JSON calls per input CVE record because you're wanting to get your because you're wanting to get your because you're wanting to get your description and then you're wanting to description and then you're wanting to description and then you're wanting to get the the product and vendor get the the product and vendor get the the product and vendor information and doing a a transform on information and doing a a transform on information and doing a a transform on that and and so because you can't do all that and and so because you can't do all that and and so because you can't do all of that in one action you end up with of that in one action you end up with of that in one action you end up with multiple import JSON calls, which multiple import JSON calls, which multiple import JSON calls, which unfortunately means you might be looking unfortunately means you might be looking unfortunately means you might be looking at two or three or more separate API at two or three or more separate API at two or three or more separate API calls per input CV, but it really calls per input CV, but it really calls per input CV, but it really depends on what you want to get out of depends on what you want to get out of depends on what you want to get out of it, right? Hello. Mhm. Mhm. Mhm. I'm thank you. I'm not sure if Google I'm thank you. I'm not sure if Google I'm thank you. I'm not sure if Google Sheets does this like recalculation Sheets does this like recalculation Sheets does this like recalculation every couple hours, days, or whatever. every couple hours, days, or whatever. every couple hours, days, or whatever. Basically what the reason I'm asking is Basically what the reason I'm asking is Basically what the reason I'm asking is one of the like use cases I'm thinking one of the like use cases I'm thinking one of the like use cases I'm thinking of is like have a set of vulnerabilities of is like have a set of vulnerabilities of is like have a set of vulnerabilities I'm interested in and have rolled sheets I'm interested in and have rolled sheets I'm interested in and have rolled sheets or whatever uh check for things like if or whatever uh check for things like if or whatever uh check for things like if is is it actually ah is it actively is is it actually ah is it actively is is it actually ah is it actively exploited right now or not like changes exploited right now or not like changes exploited right now or not like changes to the CV um and kind of like notifying to the CV um and kind of like notifying to the CV um and kind of like notifying me in some way like DCV that you you me in some way like DCV that you you me in some way like DCV that you you have here it's now being actively have here it's now being actively have here it's now being actively exploited. So, so basically, can can you exploited. So, so basically, can can you exploited. So, so basically, can can you have it do some sort of a scheduled have it do some sort of a scheduled have it do some sort of a scheduled refresh and can you roll your own sim in refresh and can you roll your own sim in refresh and can you roll your own sim in a in a Google sheet? And it's it's the a in a Google sheet? And it's it's the a in a Google sheet? And it's it's the you could add your own code under the you could add your own code under the you could add your own code under the hood in in Appcript to do that. Like if hood in in Appcript to do that. Like if hood in in Appcript to do that. Like if if you want to code it up, you could. I if you want to code it up, you could. I if you want to code it up, you could. I I don't think a particularly turnkey out I don't think a particularly turnkey out I don't think a particularly turnkey out of the box situation here. Uh there is of the box situation here. Uh there is of the box situation here. Uh there is some sort of a refresh some sort of a refresh some sort of a refresh rate baked into Google Sheets. I've just rate baked into Google Sheets. I've just rate baked into Google Sheets. I've just forgotten what the documentation says, forgotten what the documentation says, forgotten what the documentation says, but if you Google the docs, it'll it'll but if you Google the docs, it'll it'll but if you Google the docs, it'll it'll tell you what what the background sort tell you what what the background sort tell you what what the background sort of refresh cycle is. But yeah, to the of refresh cycle is. But yeah, to the of refresh cycle is. But yeah, to the notification point, you can do notification point, you can do notification point, you can do notifications from AppScript. notifications from AppScript. notifications from AppScript. So theoretically, yes, you could build So theoretically, yes, you could build So theoretically, yes, you could build some Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, I hear. Yeah. So, so, Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, I hear. Yeah. So, so, Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, I hear. Yeah. So, so, so ideally you'd want to so ideally you'd want to so ideally you'd want to avoid manually eyeballing the thing and avoid manually eyeballing the thing and avoid manually eyeballing the thing and you want it to notify you rather than it you want it to notify you rather than it you want it to notify you rather than it being like a daily workflow. being like a daily workflow. being like a daily workflow. And I've not needed to do that. So, I've And I've not needed to do that. So, I've And I've not needed to do that. So, I've not done that. But knowing what I know not done that. But knowing what I know not done that. But knowing what I know about appcript, that seems imminently about appcript, that seems imminently about appcript, that seems imminently doable. you you can you can have a doable. you you can you can have a doable. you you can you can have a essentially a chrome schedule for for essentially a chrome schedule for for essentially a chrome schedule for for any function in in in appcript for any function in in in appcript for any function in in in appcript for a any application of appcript. So so a any application of appcript. So so a any application of appcript. So so yeah like you can do that be kind of let yeah like you can do that be kind of let yeah like you can do that be kind of let me know if you do me know if you do me know if you do it. Um what else is on there? Yeah. So it. Um what else is on there? Yeah. So it. Um what else is on there? Yeah. So so like I said the whole function has to so like I said the whole function has to so like I said the whole function has to work. So, if you looked at the if you work. So, if you looked at the if you work. So, if you looked at the if you looked at looked at looked at this, you'll this, you'll this, you'll notice that the um the some of the ones here did not work. the some of the ones here did not work. the some of the ones here did not work. Um, now Um, now Um, now I, this comes back to the thing that I, this comes back to the thing that I, this comes back to the thing that annoys me about the state of the CV annoys me about the state of the CV annoys me about the state of the CV list. This list. This list. This formula to make it fit on the This formula was pretty Yeah, it's This formula was pretty Yeah, it's This formula was pretty Yeah, it's pretty funky. Um, hey. Um, one of my pet peeves about the sort Um, one of my pet peeves about the sort Um, one of my pet peeves about the sort of state of the CV list in terms of uh of state of the CV list in terms of uh of state of the CV list in terms of uh how homogeneous it is how homogeneous it is how homogeneous it is is CVSS score could be CVs v3. It could is CVSS score could be CVs v3. It could is CVSS score could be CVs v3. It could be be be CVSSB3.1 and the field that you are CVSSB3.1 and the field that you are CVSSB3.1 and the field that you are interested in differs depending on that. interested in differs depending on that. interested in differs depending on that. So you know that becomes something that So you know that becomes something that So you know that becomes something that you need to then cater for if not be you need to then cater for if not be you need to then cater for if not be aware of. So this function here in its aware of. So this function here in its aware of. So this function here in its monstrosity is an attempt to as monstrosity is an attempt to as monstrosity is an attempt to as efficiently as I possibly could in a efficiently as I possibly could in a efficiently as I possibly could in a short amount of time figure out a way to short amount of time figure out a way to short amount of time figure out a way to try both. Right? So so it tries the try both. Right? So so it tries the try both. Right? So so it tries the V3.1 field. If that fails, it falls back V3.1 field. If that fails, it falls back V3.1 field. If that fails, it falls back to 3.0. I to 3.0. I to 3.0. I think when I eyeballed these records think when I eyeballed these records think when I eyeballed these records yesterday, they have no CBSS score on yesterday, they have no CBSS score on yesterday, they have no CBSS score on them at all. So, there's an opportunity them at all. So, there's an opportunity them at all. So, there's an opportunity to sort of expand that function a little to sort of expand that function a little to sort of expand that function a little bit more to handle the situation where bit more to handle the situation where bit more to handle the situation where it's not there at all. Uh, and and then it's not there at all. Uh, and and then it's not there at all. Uh, and and then not display an error. But um that that not display an error. But um that that not display an error. But um that that that's something to that you have to that's something to that you have to that's something to that you have to consider as well is that uh sometimes consider as well is that uh sometimes consider as well is that uh sometimes the the the value you're interested in the the the value you're interested in the the the value you're interested in is simply not there. And so handling is simply not there. And so handling is simply not there. And so handling that gracefully if you care. I mean it that gracefully if you care. I mean it that gracefully if you care. I mean it depends on what you know if it's if you depends on what you know if it's if you depends on what you know if it's if you just want something quick and dirty just want something quick and dirty just want something quick and dirty still the errors right. But if you want still the errors right. But if you want still the errors right. But if you want something like the gentleman here might something like the gentleman here might something like the gentleman here might want to make a stand spreadsheet then want to make a stand spreadsheet then want to make a stand spreadsheet then you might want to handle the errors a you might want to handle the errors a you might want to handle the errors a little bit better. little bit better. little bit better. Um what Um what Um what else? So yeah. else? So yeah. else? So yeah. Yes. You said uh if you go back to the Yes. You said uh if you go back to the Yes. You said uh if you go back to the other slide, you have the whole the other slide, you have the whole the other slide, you have the whole the whole function call has to work. You are whole function call has to work. You are whole function call has to work. You are you unable to to break that up into you unable to to break that up into you unable to to break that up into separate function calls? No, you can but separate function calls? No, you can but separate function calls? No, you can but but you have to sorry the question was but you have to sorry the question was but you have to sorry the question was the whole function call has to work. Are the whole function call has to work. Are the whole function call has to work. Are you not able to break it up? Yes, that you not able to break it up? Yes, that you not able to break it up? Yes, that is exactly what you have to do at the is exactly what you have to do at the is exactly what you have to do at the cost of multiple API calls per record. cost of multiple API calls per record. cost of multiple API calls per record. Right? So, so those more advanced Right? So, so those more advanced Right? So, so those more advanced examples because I've got a function examples because I've got a function examples because I've got a function call to do what is um described call to do what is um described call to do what is um described here and then I have to do another here and then I have to do another here and then I have to do another function call to get the other fields function call to get the other fields function call to get the other fields plus handle errors or I get to a more plus handle errors or I get to a more plus handle errors or I get to a more advanced one where I'm collapsing uh advanced one where I'm collapsing uh advanced one where I'm collapsing uh vendor and product information into a vendor and product information into a vendor and product information into a single cell. You can't do both. You single cell. You can't do both. You single cell. You can't do both. You can't you can't say give me a singleton can't you can't say give me a singleton can't you can't say give me a singleton value and give me this array and while value and give me this array and while value and give me this array and while you're at it collapse that array, right? you're at it collapse that array, right? you're at it collapse that array, right? Because you just ask them too much, Because you just ask them too much, Because you just ask them too much, right? So, uh that's the trade-off is right? So, uh that's the trade-off is right? So, uh that's the trade-off is that obviously every time you make an that obviously every time you make an that obviously every time you make an API call, it could fail. Uh and so you API call, it could fail. Uh and so you API call, it could fail. Uh and so you might get a partial row back because as might get a partial row back because as might get a partial row back because as as some of those did, you know, I got as some of those did, you know, I got as some of those did, you know, I got the description but not the severity the description but not the severity the description but not the severity score, for example, because that was two score, for example, because that was two score, for example, because that was two separate API calls. So it comes down to separate API calls. So it comes down to separate API calls. So it comes down to how many records are you dealing with, how many records are you dealing with, how many records are you dealing with, how many API calls are you making, at how many API calls are you making, at how many API calls are you making, at what point does something get cranky what point does something get cranky what point does something get cranky with you. So um named ranges I talked about. So yeah, um named ranges I talked about. So yeah, um named ranges I talked about. So yeah, so this is a a sort of a more as I so this is a a sort of a more as I so this is a a sort of a more as I touched on this is this is the one where touched on this is this is the one where touched on this is this is the one where will will the real CSS field please will will the real CSS field please will will the real CSS field please stand up? stand up? stand up? Um so so yeah this this attempts to try Um so so yeah this this attempts to try Um so so yeah this this attempts to try both and then when we get CBSS4 we got both and then when we get CBSS4 we got both and then when we get CBSS4 we got to dislocate that. Uh to dislocate that. Uh to dislocate that. Uh yeah now arrays are where we get into yeah now arrays are where we get into yeah now arrays are where we get into this fun as I sort of touched on. So I this fun as I sort of touched on. So I this fun as I sort of touched on. So I talked about you can't clobber well you talked about you can't clobber well you talked about you can't clobber well you can well you can try and it won't let can well you can try and it won't let can well you can try and it won't let you uh you can't clobber rows below the you uh you can't clobber rows below the you uh you can't clobber rows below the row with the function in it. So, uh, if row with the function in it. So, uh, if row with the function in it. So, uh, if if you were to try and just straight out if you were to try and just straight out if you were to try and just straight out ask for the the affected array, if that ask for the the affected array, if that ask for the the affected array, if that had, let's say, four entries in it and had, let's say, four entries in it and had, let's say, four entries in it and you expected that to get popped out and you expected that to get popped out and you expected that to get popped out and then you had another row below that, it then you had another row below that, it then you had another row below that, it would say no. It says what it says on would say no. It says what it says on would say no. It says what it says on this slide here. It says nope, we can't this slide here. It says nope, we can't this slide here. It says nope, we can't do that because I'm going to save you do that because I'm going to save you do that because I'm going to save you from yourself. And you're like, dang. So from yourself. And you're like, dang. So from yourself. And you're like, dang. So then you have to start getting your this then you have to start getting your this then you have to start getting your this is where you get your little spreadsheet is where you get your little spreadsheet is where you get your little spreadsheet engineers hat out and you start doing engineers hat out and you start doing engineers hat out and you start doing things like well you know rather than things like well you know rather than things like well you know rather than going for rows down let's go for rows going for rows down let's go for rows going for rows down let's go for rows side you know columns they're called side you know columns they're called side you know columns they're called columns when they go sideways um and uh columns when they go sideways um and uh columns when they go sideways um and uh so transpose is really cool for that. So so transpose is really cool for that. So so transpose is really cool for that. So you know like if you've got plenty of you know like if you've got plenty of you know like if you've got plenty of columns available to you can just say columns available to you can just say columns available to you can just say rearrange it sideways please and go that rearrange it sideways please and go that rearrange it sideways please and go that way and then then you're all kind of way and then then you're all kind of way and then then you're all kind of good. uh you can do um you can index use good. uh you can do um you can index use good. uh you can do um you can index use index to sort of just pull index to sort of just pull index to sort of just pull particular cells out of that sort of particular cells out of that sort of particular cells out of that sort of hypothetical table that got returned by hypothetical table that got returned by hypothetical table that got returned by the function call. the function call. the function call. So yeah, and so this is this is the So yeah, and so this is this is the So yeah, and so this is this is the example from from that's on there where example from from that's on there where example from from that's on there where it really sort of tries to cater for the it really sort of tries to cater for the it really sort of tries to cater for the the situation where you get a variable the situation where you get a variable the situation where you get a variable size matrix back from your your call and size matrix back from your your call and size matrix back from your your call and uh it gloms everything into a single uh it gloms everything into a single uh it gloms everything into a single cell for you and then you could cell for you and then you could cell for you and then you could potentially filter on that. Um, so yeah, I'm kind of I've run out of Um, so yeah, I'm kind of I've run out of Um, so yeah, I'm kind of I've run out of uh Yeah. So, so that was, you know, we uh Yeah. So, so that was, you know, we uh Yeah. So, so that was, you know, we can play with that for as much as we can play with that for as much as we can play with that for as much as we want. Uh, does anybody I'm really want. Uh, does anybody I'm really want. Uh, does anybody I'm really interested like does this get the juices interested like does this get the juices interested like does this get the juices flowing? Does anybody have any any cool flowing? Does anybody have any any cool flowing? Does anybody have any any cool ideas on things that you could use this ideas on things that you could use this ideas on things that you could use this particular hammer for in your day job? particular hammer for in your day job? particular hammer for in your day job? I'd really love to. Yep. So, a few weeks ago, I found the same So, a few weeks ago, I found the same So, a few weeks ago, I found the same thing, import JSON. So, I've been trying thing, import JSON. So, I've been trying thing, import JSON. So, I've been trying to use their their example with where to use their their example with where to use their their example with where they put it in the A1 cell where you they put it in the A1 cell where you they put it in the A1 cell where you could import JSONs and just do it every could import JSONs and just do it every could import JSONs and just do it every day, a refresh. So, do you have ideas of day, a refresh. So, do you have ideas of day, a refresh. So, do you have ideas of things that you can use that you've used things that you can use that you've used things that you can use that you've used in your environment for like a daily in your environment for like a daily in your environment for like a daily refresh? you're making a a dash poor refresh? you're making a a dash poor refresh? you're making a a dash poor man's feed or something like that, man's feed or something like that, man's feed or something like that, right? Yeah. So, so the question is right? Yeah. So, so the question is right? Yeah. So, so the question is about, you know, that refresh that daily about, you know, that refresh that daily about, you know, that refresh that daily feed sort of thing. I've not needed to feed sort of thing. I've not needed to feed sort of thing. I've not needed to for my use case. So, I'm I'm not sort of for my use case. So, I'm I'm not sort of for my use case. So, I'm I'm not sort of doing vulnerability management by doing vulnerability management by doing vulnerability management by spreadsheet. I've been spreadsheet. I've been spreadsheet. I've been uh iterating on the accuracy and success uh iterating on the accuracy and success uh iterating on the accuracy and success rates of conversions. So, so I've I' rates of conversions. So, so I've I' rates of conversions. So, so I've I' that's not been a use case that I've that's not been a use case that I've that's not been a use case that I've needed. Uh, as I was saying to the other needed. Uh, as I was saying to the other needed. Uh, as I was saying to the other gentleman that was here before, gentleman that was here before, gentleman that was here before, it's feels very doable uh to be able to it's feels very doable uh to be able to it's feels very doable uh to be able to schedule something to to like like schedule something to to like like schedule something to to like like appcript lets you do that already, appcript lets you do that already, appcript lets you do that already, right? Like it's got the option uh to go right? Like it's got the option uh to go right? Like it's got the option uh to go in there and and say schedule an in there and and say schedule an in there and and say schedule an interval for a particular function. Yeah. Well, where are you getting the Yeah. Well, where are you getting the Yeah. Well, where are you getting the data from in the first place? Are you data from in the first place? Are you data from in the first place? Are you saying like Yeah. Yeah. For example, uh saying like Yeah. Yeah. For example, uh saying like Yeah. Yeah. For example, uh I created one the the Kev database on a I created one the the Kev database on a I created one the the Kev database on a certain, you know, JSON certain, you know, JSON certain, you know, JSON of specific vulnerabilities I'm looking of specific vulnerabilities I'm looking of specific vulnerabilities I'm looking for. I put that in A1. So every time I for. I put that in A1. So every time I for. I put that in A1. So every time I pull up the spreadsheet, it pull up the spreadsheet, it pull up the spreadsheet, it automatically automatically automatically updates information for that. And and so updates information for that. And and so updates information for that. And and so you've got a fixed set of CVES and you you've got a fixed set of CVES and you you've got a fixed set of CVES and you want to know if they hit the Kev. Is want to know if they hit the Kev. Is want to know if they hit the Kev. Is that what you want to or in Kev it that what you want to or in Kev it that what you want to or in Kev it exports things on a daily basis, things exports things on a daily basis, things exports things on a daily basis, things that are uh you know newly exploited for that are uh you know newly exploited for that are uh you know newly exploited for example and or does the Kev have an API? example and or does the Kev have an API? example and or does the Kev have an API? I haven't looked at it. It does. I haven't looked at it. It does. I haven't looked at it. It does. Yeah. Yeah. I I didn't I didn't think to Yeah. Yeah. I I didn't I didn't think to Yeah. Yeah. I I didn't I didn't think to to look at that one for this to look at that one for this to look at that one for this presentation. I'm sorry. Uh yeah, presentation. I'm sorry. Uh yeah, presentation. I'm sorry. Uh yeah, like assuming it's got a REST API as like assuming it's got a REST API as like assuming it's got a REST API as well where you can feed it a CBE ID and well where you can feed it a CBE ID and well where you can feed it a CBE ID and then get back something that you could then get back something that you could then get back something that you could then drill into for a yes or no sort of then drill into for a yes or no sort of then drill into for a yes or no sort of answer. answer. answer. Um, if you had a a set of CVE ids of Um, if you had a a set of CVE ids of Um, if you had a a set of CVE ids of interest, interest, interest, then you could simply schedule a refresh then you could simply schedule a refresh then you could simply schedule a refresh of that and then potentially have a of that and then potentially have a of that and then potentially have a trigger based off that to say if if it trigger based off that to say if if it trigger based off that to say if if it grew, you know, you have a filter and grew, you know, you have a filter and grew, you know, you have a filter and say if that filter started getting say if that filter started getting say if that filter started getting bigger in terms of how many yes values bigger in terms of how many yes values bigger in terms of how many yes values it had or something like that, notify it had or something like that, notify it had or something like that, notify me. I that that would be quite doable me. I that that would be quite doable me. I that that would be quite doable but not out of the box, right? You'd but not out of the box, right? You'd but not out of the box, right? You'd have to do a bit of extra. Uh I don't have to do a bit of extra. Uh I don't have to do a bit of extra. Uh I don't think you could do that with just think you could do that with just think you could do that with just functions. You'd probably have to write functions. You'd probably have to write functions. You'd probably have to write some appcript code on top of that as some appcript code on top of that as some appcript code on top of that as well. well. well. But But But um the appcript documentation is quite um the appcript documentation is quite um the appcript documentation is quite comprehensive for you know if you are comprehensive for you know if you are comprehensive for you know if you are comfortable with JavaScript and if comfortable with JavaScript and if comfortable with JavaScript and if you're comfortable with the the API you're comfortable with the the API you're comfortable with the the API documentation for sheets then that's documentation for sheets then that's documentation for sheets then that's that's that's that's doable. So So doable. So So doable. So So um I don't I didn't see anywhere you um I don't I didn't see anywhere you um I don't I didn't see anywhere you didn't put the date reported. You didn't didn't put the date reported. You didn't didn't put the date reported. You didn't put any date in there of when it was put any date in there of when it was put any date in there of when it was reported like some of these could be reported like some of these could be reported like some of these could be vulner obviously the year comes up but vulner obviously the year comes up but vulner obviously the year comes up but in terms of you know putting the date in in terms of you know putting the date in in terms of you know putting the date in so you maybe get a clue as to a temporal so you maybe get a clue as to a temporal so you maybe get a clue as to a temporal score or something. Yep that's a fair score or something. Yep that's a fair score or something. Yep that's a fair question. Uh you can that's a field. question. Uh you can that's a field. question. Uh you can that's a field. It's a field so you can you can grab It's a field so you can you can grab It's a field so you can you can grab that as well. like I I have historically that as well. like I I have historically that as well. like I I have historically not personally needed that information not personally needed that information not personally needed that information so I didn't think to include it but so I didn't think to include it but so I didn't think to include it but that's a fair fair fair fair fair fair fair fair fair fair fair fair fair fair fair fair fair fair fair fair fair fair fair fair fair fair fair fair fair fair fair fair fair fair fair fair fair fair comment fair question and yeah there comment fair question and yeah there comment fair question and yeah there there are uh various dates I mean what there are uh various dates I mean what there are uh various dates I mean what might be a useful thing to do like I I I might be a useful thing to do like I I I might be a useful thing to do like I I I appreciate that I spend a lot of time appreciate that I spend a lot of time appreciate that I spend a lot of time staring at the JSON of CV records but staring at the JSON of CV records but staring at the JSON of CV records but you may not and I don't blame you you may not and I don't blame you you may not and I don't blame you um so if we were to see I um so if we were to see I um so if we were to see I This is not my computer, so I don't know This is not my computer, so I don't know This is not my computer, so I don't know what's going to happen if I were to try what's going to happen if I were to try what's going to happen if I were to try and install Chrome extensions at random. and install Chrome extensions at random. and install Chrome extensions at random. But yeah, they've let me loose on But yeah, they've let me loose on But yeah, they've let me loose on somebody's computer. So, let's see what somebody's computer. So, let's see what somebody's computer. So, let's see what happens. happens. happens. Um, what could possibly go wrong? Um, Um, what could possibly go wrong? Um, Um, what could possibly go wrong? Um, let's go back let's go back let's go back here. Grab this here. Grab this here. Grab this uh Chrome extension uh Chrome extension uh Chrome extension of this guy. Excellent. All your Chrome browsers Excellent. All your Chrome browsers Excellent. All your Chrome browsers belong to me. So if we was to then and and you me. So if we was to then and and you me. So if we was to then and and you know you can make hyperlinks in a know you can make hyperlinks in a know you can make hyperlinks in a spreadsheet as well. So you can actually spreadsheet as well. So you can actually spreadsheet as well. So you can actually add the hyperlink to one of these so add the hyperlink to one of these so add the hyperlink to one of these so that you can just click out to it. that you can just click out to it. that you can just click out to it. Definitely done that before. Definitely done that before. Definitely done that before. Uh, where's my spreadsheet from? It's in Uh, where's my spreadsheet from? It's in Uh, where's my spreadsheet from? It's in this tab, isn't it? this tab, isn't it? this tab, isn't it? So, if we were to look at what was the So, if we were to look at what was the So, if we were to look at what was the one that Michael kindly gave us this one that Michael kindly gave us this one that Michael kindly gave us this guy. Um, so if we grab So if we went see that sheet engineering for fun and that sheet engineering for fun and that sheet engineering for fun and profit. So there we go. Um, let me make profit. So there we go. Um, let me make profit. So there we go. Um, let me make that a little bit bigger. How's that for that a little bit bigger. How's that for that a little bit bigger. How's that for everybody in the back room? Back row. everybody in the back room? Back row. everybody in the back room? Back row. That good. So, so this this this is why That good. So, so this this this is why That good. So, so this this this is why I like this extension because, you know, I like this extension because, you know, I like this extension because, you know, you can you can say make it look nice, you can you can say make it look nice, you can you can say make it look nice, make it look so so nice or make it look make it look so so nice or make it look make it look so so nice or make it look like garbage. Uh, and I, as you can like garbage. Uh, and I, as you can like garbage. Uh, and I, as you can imagine, I like that one. imagine, I like that one. imagine, I like that one. Um, so your question about dates, for Um, so your question about dates, for Um, so your question about dates, for example, there's all your dates, right? example, there's all your dates, right? example, there's all your dates, right? Uh, and and you can pull that in. Uh, and and you can pull that in. Uh, and and you can pull that in. I've not tried to make that then format I've not tried to make that then format I've not tried to make that then format as a date that is datable in the as a date that is datable in the as a date that is datable in the spreadsheet, but that would be totally spreadsheet, but that would be totally spreadsheet, but that would be totally doable, right? You might have to write a doable, right? You might have to write a doable, right? You might have to write a custom appcript function to massage it custom appcript function to massage it custom appcript function to massage it into the your your date format of into the your your date format of into the your your date format of choice, but but yeah, totally doable. Yeah. So that's that's the this doable. Yeah. So that's that's the this doable. Yeah. So that's that's the this is the CVE list API output. is the CVE list API output. is the CVE list API output. Um if we were Um if we were Um if we were to do the same thing with the NBD output, which for this particular one output, which for this particular one output, which for this particular one would be a little bit would be a little bit would be a little bit um Oops. That's that's what the MBD API spits out That's that's what the MBD API spits out That's that's what the MBD API spits out particularly in the state where it is particularly in the state where it is particularly in the state where it is you know awaiting analysis but yeah you get the same sort analysis but yeah you get the same sort analysis but yeah you get the same sort of of of stuff and so yeah like stuff and so yeah like stuff and so yeah like which API would you use is going to which API would you use is going to which API would you use is going to probably depend on what you're trying to probably depend on what you're trying to probably depend on what you're trying to achieve, right? Like I achieve, right? Like I achieve, right? Like I uh historically have always used the MBD uh historically have always used the MBD uh historically have always used the MBD API because the work that I was doing API because the work that I was doing API because the work that I was doing was against the MBD's data. So um that was against the MBD's data. So um that was against the MBD's data. So um that would be what I would use would be what I would use would be what I would use uh cavearted with it's got its rate uh cavearted with it's got its rate uh cavearted with it's got its rate limits and whatnot. So it what you get limits and whatnot. So it what you get limits and whatnot. So it what you get back from it might might vary a little back from it might might vary a little back from it might might vary a little bit. But bit. But bit. But um yeah, pick your API based on what you um yeah, pick your API based on what you um yeah, pick your API based on what you want to get out of it and uh go from want to get out of it and uh go from want to get out of it and uh go from there. Um yeah, we're now in the UNC the there. Um yeah, we're now in the UNC the there. Um yeah, we're now in the UNC the unworkshop phase. So very interested in unworkshop phase. So very interested in unworkshop phase. So very interested in other use cases. I'm definitely hearing other use cases. I'm definitely hearing other use cases. I'm definitely hearing the I just want to schedule it and have the I just want to schedule it and have the I just want to schedule it and have it alert me which um one of the thoughts it alert me which um one of the thoughts it alert me which um one of the thoughts I had was was if I were to I had was was if I were to I had was was if I were to hypothetically put my hand up to take hypothetically put my hand up to take hypothetically put my hand up to take the take over maintenance of this thing the take over maintenance of this thing the take over maintenance of this thing was sort of tweak it to this use case, was sort of tweak it to this use case, was sort of tweak it to this use case, right? Like this is this is a general right? Like this is this is a general right? Like this is this is a general purpose set of appcript code for talking purpose set of appcript code for talking purpose set of appcript code for talking to any JSON REST API. adding some extra stuff to be able API. adding some extra stuff to be able API. adding some extra stuff to be able to handle vulnerability specific to handle vulnerability specific to handle vulnerability specific data and you know maybe convert CVSS data and you know maybe convert CVSS data and you know maybe convert CVSS scores into something useful scores into something useful scores into something useful or any of the other sort of or any of the other sort of or any of the other sort of vulnerability specific metadata would vulnerability specific metadata would vulnerability specific metadata would would potentially be useful to to make would potentially be useful to to make would potentially be useful to to make it it it more more utilitarian for for this use more more utilitarian for for this use more more utilitarian for for this use case because I can appreciate that if case because I can appreciate that if case because I can appreciate that if everybody goes away from this going oh everybody goes away from this going oh everybody goes away from this going oh yeah cool you might all reinvent the yeah cool you might all reinvent the yeah cool you might all reinvent the in various different ways and it would in various different ways and it would in various different ways and it would be nicer to not do that from an be nicer to not do that from an be nicer to not do that from an efficiency standpoint. efficiency standpoint. efficiency standpoint. So yeah, I don't know, maybe we could So yeah, I don't know, maybe we could So yeah, I don't know, maybe we could create a community of uh create a community of uh create a community of uh vulnerability metadata spreadsheet vulnerability metadata spreadsheet vulnerability metadata spreadsheet engineers and um share tips and tricks engineers and um share tips and tricks engineers and um share tips and tricks or or or something. Could definitely see that something. Could definitely see that something. Could definitely see that happening. I love a good happening. I love a good happening. I love a good community. Hello community. Hello community. Hello sir probes gentleman down the back sir probes gentleman down the back sir probes gentleman down the back there. You can now I can repeat You can now I can repeat You can now I can repeat it but we have a microphone. it but we have a microphone. it but we have a microphone. Uh is this able to be used in a similar Uh is this able to be used in a similar Uh is this able to be used in a similar fashion with Office 365 like Microsoft's fashion with Office 365 like Microsoft's fashion with Office 365 like Microsoft's uh flavor of the sheets? Excellent uh flavor of the sheets? Excellent uh flavor of the sheets? Excellent question. I should have looked that up question. I should have looked that up question. I should have looked that up beforehand because I totally predicted beforehand because I totally predicted beforehand because I totally predicted that question coming. Uh I don't know that question coming. Uh I don't know that question coming. Uh I don't know because I've I I've I've worked for because I've I I've I've worked for because I've I I've I've worked for Google for almost 20 years and I've been Google for almost 20 years and I've been Google for almost 20 years and I've been living and breathing Google work space living and breathing Google work space living and breathing Google work space and every name that had before that. and every name that had before that. and every name that had before that. Uh Uh Uh I have not had the need personally to I have not had the need personally to I have not had the need personally to try and do that. Uh it would not use any try and do that. Uh it would not use any try and do that. Uh it would not use any of the code that I have talked through of the code that I have talked through of the code that I have talked through here today because that is all geared here today because that is all geared here today because that is all geared towards appcript and and Google sheets. towards appcript and and Google sheets. towards appcript and and Google sheets. So, So, So, uh, I do not know to be honest and I uh, I do not know to be honest and I uh, I do not know to be honest and I apologize for not having back, you know, apologize for not having back, you know, apologize for not having back, you know, I predicted that question and then I predicted that question and then I predicted that question and then didn't get around to having a prepared didn't get around to having a prepared didn't get around to having a prepared answer for it. So, no worries. That answer for it. So, no worries. That answer for it. So, no worries. That makes sense, too. I would I I could makes sense, too. I would I I could makes sense, too. I would I I could imagine the Google query that I would do imagine the Google query that I would do imagine the Google query that I would do to to try and answer that question, to to try and answer that question, to to try and answer that question, which would be something on the lines which would be something on the lines which would be something on the lines of, you know, JSON, REST, API, Excel. I of, you know, JSON, REST, API, Excel. I of, you know, JSON, REST, API, Excel. I I'd be Does anybody know does does Excel I'd be Does anybody know does does Excel I'd be Does anybody know does does Excel I mean, does VBScript back in the day, I mean, does VBScript back in the day, I mean, does VBScript back in the day, right? Like um like right? Like um like right? Like um like Last time I touched Excel in anger, at Last time I touched Excel in anger, at Last time I touched Excel in anger, at least it supported things like BBScript least it supported things like BBScript least it supported things like BBScript and whatnot, but I I don't know how how and whatnot, but I I don't know how how and whatnot, but I I don't know how how it works in 2025, unfortunately, because it works in 2025, unfortunately, because it works in 2025, unfortunately, because I not needed to. So, I not needed to. So, I not needed to. So, no worries. Thank you. You're welcome. no worries. Thank you. You're welcome. no worries. Thank you. You're welcome. It's still the Of course it is. We can certainly end early. Any other We can certainly end early. Any other We can certainly end early. Any other questions in the room or on Discord? questions in the room or on Discord? questions in the room or on Discord? Anything on the Discord? That was it. Cool. All right. So, thank you for the All right. So, thank you for the All right. So, thank you for the presentation. Thank you. Um, I've been presentation. Thank you. Um, I've been presentation. Thank you. Um, I've been looking at the deps.dev API and the big looking at the deps.dev API and the big looking at the deps.dev API and the big query data behind it and it's got the query data behind it and it's got the query data behind it and it's got the advisories table and advisories API. advisories table and advisories API. advisories table and advisories API. What's the overlap or lack of overlap What's the overlap or lack of overlap What's the overlap or lack of overlap between the data that you might get from between the data that you might get from between the data that you might get from pulling out from the specific APIs and pulling out from the specific APIs and pulling out from the specific APIs and what's there in devs.dev and behind it what's there in devs.dev and behind it what's there in devs.dev and behind it in BigQuery? Yeah. Uh, so what's the in BigQuery? Yeah. Uh, so what's the in BigQuery? Yeah. Uh, so what's the difference between deps.dev's data in difference between deps.dev's data in difference between deps.dev's data in BigQuery and what you might get from BigQuery and what you might get from BigQuery and what you might get from these APIs? I'm I'm not super super familiar with I'm I'm not super super familiar with I'm I'm not super super familiar with the data at a at a really nitty-gritty the data at a at a really nitty-gritty the data at a at a really nitty-gritty level, but I'm I'm familiar with it at a level, but I'm I'm familiar with it at a level, but I'm I'm familiar with it at a high level because it's our sister team high level because it's our sister team high level because it's our sister team in in Australia. They are predominantly in in Australia. They are predominantly in in Australia. They are predominantly scraping, pulling um package registry scraping, pulling um package registry scraping, pulling um package registry version information and then they do a version information and then they do a version information and then they do a little bit of marrying that up with little bit of marrying that up with little bit of marrying that up with vulnerability information as well. uh vulnerability information as well. uh vulnerability information as well. uh but but it's primarily you know what but but it's primarily you know what but but it's primarily you know what what are the known versions in in a in a what are the known versions in in a in a what are the known versions in in a in a package registry package registry package registry ecosystem from the top of my knowledge. ecosystem from the top of my knowledge. ecosystem from the top of my knowledge. So there'll be a bit of a a bit of a So there'll be a bit of a a bit of a So there'll be a bit of a a bit of a difference in terms of what you're difference in terms of what you're difference in terms of what you're trying to get from it. Like I would trying to get from it. Like I would trying to get from it. Like I would normally say go straight to the normally say go straight to the normally say go straight to the vulnerability databases. vulnerability databases. vulnerability databases. Yeah. It does. Yeah. And and it's it's it's It does. Yeah. And and it's it's it's It does. Yeah. And and it's it's it's pulling from OSV for the most part. So, pulling from OSV for the most part. So, pulling from OSV for the most part. So, uh, if you, one of the other things that I was you, one of the other things that I was you, one of the other things that I was going to try and do for this, going to try and do for this, going to try and do for this, uh, for for this workshop, which I uh, for for this workshop, which I uh, for for this workshop, which I didn't get an opportunity to get around didn't get an opportunity to get around didn't get an opportunity to get around to, to, to, was using OSV or GitHub's uh, query API was using OSV or GitHub's uh, query API was using OSV or GitHub's uh, query API to say to go from the other end and say, to say to go from the other end and say, to say to go from the other end and say, I have an inventory of these packages at I have an inventory of these packages at I have an inventory of these packages at these versions. these versions. these versions. what are they vulnerable to, right? And what are they vulnerable to, right? And what are they vulnerable to, right? And and then you've essentially then built and then you've essentially then built and then you've essentially then built something like OSP scanner in in a something like OSP scanner in in a something like OSP scanner in in a spreadsheet. So like because it because spreadsheet. So like because it because spreadsheet. So like because it because it's code underneath like like you can it's code underneath like like you can it's code underneath like like you can do anything you want if you want to do anything you want if you want to do anything you want if you want to spend the time, right? Like it's just spend the time, right? Like it's just spend the time, right? Like it's just whether you should or not is the is it whether you should or not is the is it whether you should or not is the is it the right tool for the job? Uh but yeah, the right tool for the job? Uh but yeah, the right tool for the job? Uh but yeah, like like there are plenty of other API like like there are plenty of other API like like there are plenty of other API calls you could make rather than just calls you could make rather than just calls you could make rather than just the here's my vulnerability ID, give me the here's my vulnerability ID, give me the here's my vulnerability ID, give me the metadata. You could say, well, the metadata. You could say, well, the metadata. You could say, well, here's my package and version, give me here's my package and version, give me here's my package and version, give me the vulnerabilities for it. the vulnerabilities for it. the vulnerabilities for it. And on a good day, you get no rows back, And on a good day, you get no rows back, And on a good day, you get no rows back, right? On a bad day, you get locks and right? On a bad day, you get locks and right? On a bad day, you get locks and you cry and you get an alert and you go you cry and you get an alert and you go you cry and you get an alert and you go into response mode. All right. Well, into response mode. All right. Well, into response mode. All right. Well, everybody, I want to thank Andrew for everybody, I want to thank Andrew for everybody, I want to thank Andrew for giving us a little demonstration on how giving us a little demonstration on how giving us a little demonstration on how to empower our spreadsheets.
