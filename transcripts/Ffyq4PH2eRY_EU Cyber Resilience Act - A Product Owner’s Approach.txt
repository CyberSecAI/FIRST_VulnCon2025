Kind: captions Language: en Again, my name is Langley Rock. I'm here Again, my name is Langley Rock. I'm here Again, my name is Langley Rock. I'm here to talk about the EU CRA from a product to talk about the EU CRA from a product to talk about the EU CRA from a product owner's owner's owner's perspective. Um, I've been working for perspective. Um, I've been working for perspective. Um, I've been working for Dell Technologies for about three years. Dell Technologies for about three years. Dell Technologies for about three years. And although it might look like a shame And although it might look like a shame And although it might look like a shame only a shameless plug, I wanted to draw only a shameless plug, I wanted to draw only a shameless plug, I wanted to draw attention to some of the other high-tech attention to some of the other high-tech attention to some of the other high-tech companies I've worked for companies I've worked for companies I've worked for previously because one of the common previously because one of the common previously because one of the common themes is when working with my themes is when working with my themes is when working with my engineering team stakeholders, they all engineering team stakeholders, they all engineering team stakeholders, they all want to do the right want to do the right want to do the right thing. Um, but sometimes they run into thing. Um, but sometimes they run into thing. Um, but sometimes they run into complete complete complete completing completing completing priorities that prevent them to do so. priorities that prevent them to do so. priorities that prevent them to do so. The other other The other other The other other times they get frustrated easily when times they get frustrated easily when times they get frustrated easily when the requirements aren't easily the requirements aren't easily the requirements aren't easily communicated to them or they just don't communicated to them or they just don't communicated to them or they just don't make sense. They don't understand the make sense. They don't understand the make sense. They don't understand the why sometimes behind the the the why sometimes behind the the the why sometimes behind the the the requirements. So my history of 20 years requirements. So my history of 20 years requirements. So my history of 20 years of product security has been you know f of product security has been you know f of product security has been you know f focused originally on common criteria focused originally on common criteria focused originally on common criteria and fips certifications for a couple of and fips certifications for a couple of and fips certifications for a couple of organizations. then transition to a a organizations. then transition to a a organizations. then transition to a a focus of product security, SDL or secure focus of product security, SDL or secure focus of product security, SDL or secure development life cycles and then more development life cycles and then more development life cycles and then more recently GRC type related roles and once recently GRC type related roles and once recently GRC type related roles and once again this is a common theme people want again this is a common theme people want again this is a common theme people want to do the right thing just need to make to do the right thing just need to make to do the right thing just need to make sure that the requirements are really sure that the requirements are really sure that the requirements are really well understood and that is my role well understood and that is my role well understood and that is my role today as a product owner for today as a product owner for today as a product owner for vulnerability response policies and vulnerability response policies and vulnerability response policies and standards and regulatory and GRC related standards and regulatory and GRC related standards and regulatory and GRC related activities and I am based in Ottawa activities and I am based in Ottawa activities and I am based in Ottawa Canada. I was able to make it over. I'm going to try and uh see the over. I'm going to try and uh see the over. I'm going to try and uh see the screen from here. My eyes are not the screen from here. My eyes are not the screen from here. My eyes are not the greatest greatest greatest unfortunately. So unfortunately. So unfortunately. So um there were some very good um there were some very good um there were some very good presentations this morning especially presentations this morning especially presentations this morning especially you know delivered by CRO um on the ECR you know delivered by CRO um on the ECR you know delivered by CRO um on the ECR went into extensive detail to the number went into extensive detail to the number went into extensive detail to the number of the requirements. I just want to give of the requirements. I just want to give of the requirements. I just want to give a very brief elevator pitch as to what a very brief elevator pitch as to what a very brief elevator pitch as to what the EUCRA is. Software and hardware the EUCRA is. Software and hardware the EUCRA is. Software and hardware vendors will have to comply with the vendors will have to comply with the vendors will have to comply with the provisions in the ER EUR if they want to provisions in the ER EUR if they want to provisions in the ER EUR if they want to continue doing business in the EU. As continue doing business in the EU. As continue doing business in the EU. As simple as that. Once passed, uh which we simple as that. Once passed, uh which we simple as that. Once passed, uh which we anticipate as being December the 11th, anticipate as being December the 11th, anticipate as being December the 11th, 2027 for most of the requirements. 2027 for most of the requirements. 2027 for most of the requirements. uh non-compliance is subject to fines of uh non-compliance is subject to fines of uh non-compliance is subject to fines of up to 15 million euros or 2.5% of the up to 15 million euros or 2.5% of the up to 15 million euros or 2.5% of the annual revenue of the organization. Um annual revenue of the organization. Um annual revenue of the organization. Um no examples have been set yet so we no examples have been set yet so we no examples have been set yet so we don't know you know if someone is going don't know you know if someone is going don't know you know if someone is going to be made an example of uh hopefully to be made an example of uh hopefully to be made an example of uh hopefully this $15 million is is indeed a worst this $15 million is is indeed a worst this $15 million is is indeed a worst case and it is per case and it is per case and it is per infraction. Now naturally this is going infraction. Now naturally this is going infraction. Now naturally this is going to have an impact on our downstream to have an impact on our downstream to have an impact on our downstream suppliers. suppliers. suppliers. Um, as one of one of the things that had Um, as one of one of the things that had Um, as one of one of the things that had been discussed earlier is that open- been discussed earlier is that open- been discussed earlier is that open- source stewards are not being held to source stewards are not being held to source stewards are not being held to the same requirements, which basically the same requirements, which basically the same requirements, which basically means that if you have an open source means that if you have an open source means that if you have an open source component in your product and your and component in your product and your and component in your product and your and your product has a vulnerability in that your product has a vulnerability in that your product has a vulnerability in that open source component, you are open source component, you are open source component, you are ultimately responsible for ultimately responsible for ultimately responsible for it. And you have to work, you know, rely it. And you have to work, you know, rely it. And you have to work, you know, rely on your trust relationships and your on your trust relationships and your on your trust relationships and your relationships with your suppliers to get relationships with your suppliers to get relationships with your suppliers to get those vulnerabilities fixed or or fix those vulnerabilities fixed or or fix those vulnerabilities fixed or or fix them yourself. And one of the the other problems or uh And one of the the other problems or uh And one of the the other problems or uh facts that uh you might need to uh take facts that uh you might need to uh take facts that uh you might need to uh take into consideration is that um if the into consideration is that um if the into consideration is that um if the requirement for no known vulnerabilities requirement for no known vulnerabilities requirement for no known vulnerabilities is strictly enforced, it might actually is strictly enforced, it might actually is strictly enforced, it might actually have a big impact on your ability to get have a big impact on your ability to get have a big impact on your ability to get products to market. So we talked about So we talked about So we talked about um what the EUC is at a very very high um what the EUC is at a very very high um what the EUC is at a very very high level. How do we make meet level. How do we make meet level. How do we make meet compliance? So there's a concept of compliance? So there's a concept of compliance? So there's a concept of harmonized standards and these standards harmonized standards and these standards harmonized standards and these standards are basically written for the EUR or are basically written for the EUR or are basically written for the EUR or will be written for the ECR and there's will be written for the ECR and there's will be written for the ECR and there's um an assumption if you will or a um an assumption if you will or a um an assumption if you will or a provision that if you're compliant with provision that if you're compliant with provision that if you're compliant with the harmonized standards you are meeting the harmonized standards you are meeting the harmonized standards you are meeting all your legal obligations as part of all your legal obligations as part of all your legal obligations as part of the the the act. Um as of today those standards do act. Um as of today those standards do act. Um as of today those standards do not exist. There are a lot of different not exist. There are a lot of different not exist. There are a lot of different drafts or or frameworks in in process in drafts or or frameworks in in process in drafts or or frameworks in in process in progress, but we if worst case scenario progress, but we if worst case scenario progress, but we if worst case scenario materializes, we're not going to have materializes, we're not going to have materializes, we're not going to have those provisions until those provisions until those provisions until 2027. So, what do we do? Do we actually 2027. So, what do we do? Do we actually 2027. So, what do we do? Do we actually just wait or do we actually try and take just wait or do we actually try and take just wait or do we actually try and take some action today to, you know, against some action today to, you know, against some action today to, you know, against the the requirements that we do know the the requirements that we do know the the requirements that we do know of? And hopefully this proactive of? And hopefully this proactive of? And hopefully this proactive approach I'm going to be talking to or approach I'm going to be talking to or approach I'm going to be talking to or hi uh giving an overview of is going to hi uh giving an overview of is going to hi uh giving an overview of is going to give you some tools in your tool chest give you some tools in your tool chest give you some tools in your tool chest to have those elevator conversations if to have those elevator conversations if to have those elevator conversations if you will. So talking about the harmonized will. So talking about the harmonized will. So talking about the harmonized standards there are basically four standards there are basically four standards there are basically four groups of categories or four groups of groups of categories or four groups of groups of categories or four groups of products that we need to look at. a products that we need to look at. a products that we need to look at. a default product, something similar to a default product, something similar to a default product, something similar to a um an alarm clock if you will or um an alarm clock if you will or um an alarm clock if you will or um uh a smart refrigerator. I mean, um uh a smart refrigerator. I mean, um uh a smart refrigerator. I mean, these these will fall into the the these these will fall into the the these these will fall into the the default category and only a self self default category and only a self self default category and only a self self assessment is necessary for them to assessment is necessary for them to assessment is necessary for them to actually be able to get the actually be able to get the actually be able to get the mark important class one products. So mark important class one products. So mark important class one products. So this would be an operating system, a this would be an operating system, a this would be an operating system, a physical or virtual uh network physical or virtual uh network physical or virtual uh network interface, a web browser. These are all interface, a web browser. These are all interface, a web browser. These are all classified as as category one. And a classified as as category one. And a classified as as category one. And a self assessment is okay as long as you self assessment is okay as long as you self assessment is okay as long as you can demonstrate compliance with a with a can demonstrate compliance with a with a can demonstrate compliance with a with a harmonized harmonized harmonized standard. Important class two products standard. Important class two products standard. Important class two products are a little bit more stringent such as are a little bit more stringent such as are a little bit more stringent such as hypervisors or smart cards or sorry hypervisors or smart cards or sorry hypervisors or smart cards or sorry smart cards are are an example of the smart cards are are an example of the smart cards are are an example of the critical um TPMs trusted platform critical um TPMs trusted platform critical um TPMs trusted platform modules those would be examples of class modules those would be examples of class modules those would be examples of class 2 products and then the critical product 2 products and then the critical product 2 products and then the critical product would be something like a smart card in would be something like a smart card in would be something like a smart card in the case of the important class two and the case of the important class two and the case of the important class two and smart card products it's not something smart card products it's not something smart card products it's not something that you can do in house you're going to that you can do in house you're going to that you can do in house you're going to have to go to an external evaluation have to go to an external evaluation have to go to an external evaluation body uh such as uh one of them that show body uh such as uh one of them that show body uh such as uh one of them that show up in the Nando up in the Nando up in the Nando database or in the case of smart cards database or in the case of smart cards database or in the case of smart cards and those critical products and those critical products and those critical products um go through a a lengthy common um go through a a lengthy common um go through a a lengthy common criteria an expensive common criteria criteria an expensive common criteria criteria an expensive common criteria certification. Now the definition of certification. Now the definition of certification. Now the definition of these products are still up being worked these products are still up being worked these products are still up being worked out and as a matter of fact there's this out and as a matter of fact there's this out and as a matter of fact there's this is an open period for commentary and I is an open period for commentary and I is an open period for commentary and I believe the period closes next week on believe the period closes next week on believe the period closes next week on the 15th. So uh stay tuned for more the 15th. So uh stay tuned for more the 15th. So uh stay tuned for more information in that regard. information in that regard. information in that regard. So as as I mentioned important class So as as I mentioned important class So as as I mentioned important class ones include the concept of operating ones include the concept of operating ones include the concept of operating systems and physical network interfaces systems and physical network interfaces systems and physical network interfaces and in an operating and in an operating and in an operating system you can have other elements you system you can have other elements you system you can have other elements you know so uh it can include a a password know so uh it can include a a password know so uh it can include a a password manager it can include the web browser manager it can include the web browser manager it can include the web browser it can include VPN it can include VPN it can include VPN functionality but functionality but functionality but um the the point that I want to stress um the the point that I want to stress um the the point that I want to stress going on to the Next slide is if you going on to the Next slide is if you going on to the Next slide is if you look at a general purpose computing look at a general purpose computing look at a general purpose computing platform, it does not nec even though platform, it does not nec even though platform, it does not nec even though you might include an operating system you might include an operating system you might include an operating system and that operating system might include and that operating system might include and that operating system might include the physical network interfaces, it does the physical network interfaces, it does the physical network interfaces, it does not necessarily mean by the the way the not necessarily mean by the the way the not necessarily mean by the the way the regulation has been written, it does not regulation has been written, it does not regulation has been written, it does not necessarily mean that you are necessarily mean that you are necessarily mean that you are automatically a class one product. So automatically a class one product. So automatically a class one product. So this is where those definitions and the this is where those definitions and the this is where those definitions and the ratification of those definitions really ratification of those definitions really ratification of those definitions really is important. So this is going to be a little bit more So this is going to be a little bit more So this is going to be a little bit more difficult for me to present difficult for me to present difficult for me to present unfortunately. Um but basically you know unfortunately. Um but basically you know unfortunately. Um but basically you know to to to to Does this come to Does this come to Does this come out? out? out? No. Let's see if I can get this out. No. out. No. out. No. Okay. I'm going to come around to the Okay. I'm going to come around to the Okay. I'm going to come around to the other side of the podium and let's uh other side of the podium and let's uh other side of the podium and let's uh let's improvise. let's improvise. let's improvise. All right. So, All right. So, All right. So, basically, here's a a short list of some basically, here's a a short list of some basically, here's a a short list of some of the steps that we took to try and of the steps that we took to try and of the steps that we took to try and reach reach reach compliance. Um, first of all, identify compliance. Um, first of all, identify compliance. Um, first of all, identify your target products. try to understand your target products. try to understand your target products. try to understand what what group those products might what what group those products might what what group those products might fall under and figure out not only fall under and figure out not only fall under and figure out not only um figure out not only what what groups um figure out not only what what groups um figure out not only what what groups they're in but also try to understand they're in but also try to understand they're in but also try to understand um whether or not they will be on the um whether or not they will be on the um whether or not they will be on the market in December 27 27 because this is market in December 27 27 because this is market in December 27 27 because this is only going to affect new products that only going to affect new products that only going to affect new products that are placed on the market are made are placed on the market are made are placed on the market are made available on the market as of that available on the market as of that available on the market as of that date. Bucketize the requirements into date. Bucketize the requirements into date. Bucketize the requirements into themes and I will be talk giving you a a themes and I will be talk giving you a a themes and I will be talk giving you a a demo or a view of what those themes may demo or a view of what those themes may demo or a view of what those themes may look like but bucketize in the themes. look like but bucketize in the themes. look like but bucketize in the themes. Identify when you go through the CRA Identify when you go through the CRA Identify when you go through the CRA requirements look at what there is and requirements look at what there is and requirements look at what there is and identify what you do today and what you identify what you do today and what you identify what you do today and what you do well and put that into a bucket of do well and put that into a bucket of do well and put that into a bucket of lowest perceived risk. Then look at what you've already risk. Then look at what you've already risk. Then look at what you've already got where you already have plans in got where you already have plans in got where you already have plans in motion. motion. motion. um and take a risk-based approach based um and take a risk-based approach based um and take a risk-based approach based on the complexity of of the of the on the complexity of of the of the on the complexity of of the of the changes or of the the work that needs to changes or of the the work that needs to changes or of the the work that needs to be done. You might need to accelerate be done. You might need to accelerate be done. You might need to accelerate your work. You might need to your work. You might need to your work. You might need to um pivot a little bit. Um and then plan um pivot a little bit. Um and then plan um pivot a little bit. Um and then plan out areas where you believe practices out areas where you believe practices out areas where you believe practices are weak or non-existent. So these are are weak or non-existent. So these are are weak or non-existent. So these are the net new requirements and this is the net new requirements and this is the net new requirements and this is really where you need to work with your really where you need to work with your really where you need to work with your lawyer uh your your legal people to come lawyer uh your your legal people to come lawyer uh your your legal people to come up with a risk-based approach uh and up with a risk-based approach uh and up with a risk-based approach uh and then work with your stakehold your then work with your stakehold your then work with your stakehold your internal stakeholders to figure out internal stakeholders to figure out internal stakeholders to figure out exactly where the effort and readiness lies. Cross reference those net new lies. Cross reference those net new lies. Cross reference those net new uh requirements against your security uh requirements against your security uh requirements against your security charter. Hopefully everyone here works charter. Hopefully everyone here works charter. Hopefully everyone here works for an organization where there is a for an organization where there is a for an organization where there is a security charter when it comes to the security charter when it comes to the security charter when it comes to the products and software and the hardware products and software and the hardware products and software and the hardware products that you that you deliver. And products that you that you deliver. And products that you that you deliver. And identify the lowhanging fruit. Identify identify the lowhanging fruit. Identify identify the lowhanging fruit. Identify where you believe that you have bigger where you believe that you have bigger where you believe that you have bigger gaps from what the the CRA is looking gaps from what the the CRA is looking gaps from what the the CRA is looking for. Implement a risk based reporting. for. Implement a risk based reporting. for. Implement a risk based reporting. And this is one of the the key points I And this is one of the the key points I And this is one of the the key points I can't stress enough. Um alongside of uh can't stress enough. Um alongside of uh can't stress enough. Um alongside of uh making sure that you identify your making sure that you identify your making sure that you identify your stakeholders and you socialize, you stakeholders and you socialize, you stakeholders and you socialize, you know, from the top down as well as the know, from the top down as well as the know, from the top down as well as the bottom up, uh it's really important that bottom up, uh it's really important that bottom up, uh it's really important that with that socialization and that risk with that socialization and that risk with that socialization and that risk based uh based uh based uh reporting, you are able to bring reporting, you are able to bring reporting, you are able to bring visibility to those areas of the CRA visibility to those areas of the CRA visibility to those areas of the CRA that are not going to be met in time and that are not going to be met in time and that are not going to be met in time and let the company help you make the let the company help you make the let the company help you make the decision. You know, we all want to do decision. You know, we all want to do decision. You know, we all want to do the right thing. We all think that we the right thing. We all think that we the right thing. We all think that we can, you know, do our little part, but can, you know, do our little part, but can, you know, do our little part, but some of these decisions going to be some of these decisions going to be some of these decisions going to be bigger than each of us as individuals. bigger than each of us as individuals. bigger than each of us as individuals. And we really need to come together as And we really need to come together as And we really need to come together as an organization and figure it out as an an organization and figure it out as an an organization and figure it out as an organization and let the organization organization and let the organization organization and let the organization understand and you know decide how they understand and you know decide how they understand and you know decide how they want to treat that risk. want to treat that risk. want to treat that risk. Uh also if you're a product owner, you Uh also if you're a product owner, you Uh also if you're a product owner, you actually, you know, develop or you're actually, you know, develop or you're actually, you know, develop or you're responsible for a software hardware responsible for a software hardware responsible for a software hardware product, start looking at your product, start looking at your product, start looking at your three-year plan now as it's more like a three-year plan now as it's more like a three-year plan now as it's more like a two and a half year plan. But um try to two and a half year plan. But um try to two and a half year plan. But um try to bake in the security requirements more bake in the security requirements more bake in the security requirements more than you maybe have done in the past. It than you maybe have done in the past. It than you maybe have done in the past. It is going to be really important for you is going to be really important for you is going to be really important for you to be ready out of the gate. Um and make to be ready out of the gate. Um and make to be ready out of the gate. Um and make sure that sure that sure that um you know any fiscal targets, any um you know any fiscal targets, any um you know any fiscal targets, any um uh delivery dates, you know, take um uh delivery dates, you know, take um uh delivery dates, you know, take really take into consideration the really take into consideration the really take into consideration the security requirements as well. So here's an example of what the well. So here's an example of what the well. So here's an example of what the requirements look like. So this is an requirements look like. So this is an requirements look like. So this is an example of what net new requirements example of what net new requirements example of what net new requirements might look like for an organization. It might look like for an organization. It might look like for an organization. It is not necessarily and I will stress is not necessarily and I will stress is not necessarily and I will stress this. It does not necessarily represent this. It does not necessarily represent this. It does not necessarily represent what Dell has uh has done. But there are what Dell has uh has done. But there are what Dell has uh has done. But there are requirements in the CRA that talk about requirements in the CRA that talk about requirements in the CRA that talk about continuous testing and that can be go continuous testing and that can be go continuous testing and that can be go into a security testing bucket if you into a security testing bucket if you into a security testing bucket if you will. And then security updates where will. And then security updates where will. And then security updates where you have the secure distribution of of you have the secure distribution of of you have the secure distribution of of updates, automatic downloads from updates, automatic downloads from updates, automatic downloads from products, uh download configuration and products, uh download configuration and products, uh download configuration and decouple security updates. Those those decouple security updates. Those those decouple security updates. Those those seem to mesh together. seem to mesh together. seem to mesh together. Um vulnerability response is a big one Um vulnerability response is a big one Um vulnerability response is a big one and uh I I glossed over it due to the and uh I I glossed over it due to the and uh I I glossed over it due to the the technical difficulties earlier, but the technical difficulties earlier, but the technical difficulties earlier, but vulnerability response uh requirements vulnerability response uh requirements vulnerability response uh requirements are kicking in in September are kicking in in September are kicking in in September 2026, not December 2027. So this is 2026, not December 2027. So this is 2026, not December 2027. So this is going to be another level of involvement going to be another level of involvement going to be another level of involvement and another milestone that people are and another milestone that people are and another milestone that people are going to be expected to going to be expected to going to be expected to meet. Um but you know documenting meet. Um but you know documenting meet. Um but you know documenting vulnerabilities and remediations, timely vulnerabilities and remediations, timely vulnerabilities and remediations, timely communication and remediation, communication and remediation, communication and remediation, coordinated disclosure and making sure coordinated disclosure and making sure coordinated disclosure and making sure that the the advisories are available in that the the advisories are available in that the the advisories are available in a machine readable format is going to be a machine readable format is going to be a machine readable format is going to be paramount. paramount. paramount. uh security assessments, the the uh security assessments, the the uh security assessments, the the internal work that needs to be done, you internal work that needs to be done, you internal work that needs to be done, you know, analysis of cyber security risks, know, analysis of cyber security risks, know, analysis of cyber security risks, technical documentation to support the technical documentation to support the technical documentation to support the the support the good practice that the support the good practice that the support the good practice that practices that you're following and you practices that you're following and you practices that you're following and you know that those will fall into a bucket know that those will fall into a bucket know that those will fall into a bucket of security assessments. Hopefully, of security assessments. Hopefully, of security assessments. Hopefully, you're getting the idea of what I'm you're getting the idea of what I'm you're getting the idea of what I'm talking about here. group that go talking about here. group that go talking about here. group that go through the uh the various annexes of through the uh the various annexes of through the uh the various annexes of the requirements, put them into buckets the requirements, put them into buckets the requirements, put them into buckets and then that maybe merge those buckets and then that maybe merge those buckets and then that maybe merge those buckets into higher level objectives depending into higher level objectives depending into higher level objectives depending on how your organization structure is uh established. I mentioned a security established. I mentioned a security established. I mentioned a security charter earlier. charter earlier. charter earlier. Um, so really hopefully every Um, so really hopefully every Um, so really hopefully every organization has one of these, but if organization has one of these, but if organization has one of these, but if not, it's a good time to start working not, it's a good time to start working not, it's a good time to start working with your your senior leadership to put with your your senior leadership to put with your your senior leadership to put one together. And really what one together. And really what one together. And really what this what this where this is important this what this where this is important this what this where this is important is it's when working with or with uh is it's when working with or with uh is it's when working with or with uh various internal stakeholders, you want various internal stakeholders, you want various internal stakeholders, you want to build that street credibility. And if to build that street credibility. And if to build that street credibility. And if you don't have a CH security charter you don't have a CH security charter you don't have a CH security charter now, unfortunately, it's going to be a now, unfortunately, it's going to be a now, unfortunately, it's going to be a little bit more complicated for you than little bit more complicated for you than little bit more complicated for you than say an organization that has had a say an organization that has had a say an organization that has had a charter for a longer period of time charter for a longer period of time charter for a longer period of time simply because um you have been warning simply because um you have been warning simply because um you have been warning your stakeholders that this is coming your stakeholders that this is coming your stakeholders that this is coming down the pipe that is this is going to down the pipe that is this is going to down the pipe that is this is going to happen. This is going to happen. Well, happen. This is going to happen. Well, happen. This is going to happen. Well, it's finally happening. it's finally happening. it's finally happening. So hopefully the security charter that So hopefully the security charter that So hopefully the security charter that that that is in that that is in that that is in place has encouraged teams to start place has encouraged teams to start place has encouraged teams to start doing the right thing and start doing the right thing and start doing the right thing and start documenting what they're doing. So make documenting what they're doing. So make documenting what they're doing. So make the the CRA requirements a little bit the the CRA requirements a little bit the the CRA requirements a little bit less ownorous. So to wrap this up, the UC ownorous. So to wrap this up, the UC ownorous. So to wrap this up, the UC will significantly impact how end-to-end will significantly impact how end-to-end will significantly impact how end-to-end security product teams function and security product teams function and security product teams function and December 2027 isn't that far away. December 2027 isn't that far away. December 2027 isn't that far away. Despite some ambiguities remaining, we Despite some ambiguities remaining, we Despite some ambiguities remaining, we must align our practices with the must align our practices with the must align our practices with the essential requirements, focusing on essential requirements, focusing on essential requirements, focusing on these key deliverables, a proactive these key deliverables, a proactive these key deliverables, a proactive approach to product development approach to product development approach to product development roadmaps, third-party risk management, roadmaps, third-party risk management, roadmaps, third-party risk management, and determination of products needing to and determination of products needing to and determination of products needing to meet the harmonized meet the harmonized meet the harmonized standards. Industry collaboration standards. Industry collaboration standards. Industry collaboration through established organizations will through established organizations will through established organizations will be paramount. Uh I'm a member of the be paramount. Uh I'm a member of the be paramount. Uh I'm a member of the safe code organization that that focuses safe code organization that that focuses safe code organization that that focuses on it and I believe open SSF has one as on it and I believe open SSF has one as on it and I believe open SSF has one as well and we recognize that the next two well and we recognize that the next two well and we recognize that the next two and a half years will be a challenge for and a half years will be a challenge for and a half years will be a challenge for industry to align practices with the CRA industry to align practices with the CRA industry to align practices with the CRA requirements but hopefully some of the requirements but hopefully some of the requirements but hopefully some of the guidelines provided will help you uh set guidelines provided will help you uh set guidelines provided will help you uh set yourselves up for yourselves up for yourselves up for success. Thank you. Any questions? Yes. Could you go to the mic, please? Yes. Could you go to the mic, please? Yes. Could you go to the mic, please? Thank you. I'll try to hear. Sure. Okay. There's no way to actually release a There's no way to actually release a There's no way to actually release a product because there are like 82 product because there are like 82 product because there are like 82 vulnerabilities every day and never get vulnerabilities every day and never get vulnerabilities every day and never get a product. So how are you thinking like a product. So how are you thinking like a product. So how are you thinking like they I don't think they will implement they I don't think they will implement they I don't think they will implement it in that strict way but what what is it in that strict way but what what is it in that strict way but what what is your vision? your time to like who is your vision? your time to like who is your vision? your time to like who is within your organization. within your organization. within your organization. Okay. So, if I understand the question Okay. So, if I understand the question Okay. So, if I understand the question correctly, you're asking how we perceive correctly, you're asking how we perceive correctly, you're asking how we perceive the requirement of known exploitable the requirement of known exploitable the requirement of known exploitable vulnerabilities and how we're going to vulnerabilities and how we're going to vulnerabilities and how we're going to manage that. Well, I can't tell you how manage that. Well, I can't tell you how manage that. Well, I can't tell you how we're going to manage it because I don't we're going to manage it because I don't we're going to manage it because I don't think all those all those details have think all those all those details have think all those all those details have been sorted out. uh but my view is that been sorted out. uh but my view is that been sorted out. uh but my view is that there needs to be a mild milestone in there needs to be a mild milestone in there needs to be a mild milestone in your software or hardware development your software or hardware development your software or hardware development life cycle where there there's a a known life cycle where there there's a a known life cycle where there there's a a known cut off point when you go to um go to cut off point when you go to um go to cut off point when you go to um go to release your release processes. I think release your release processes. I think release your release processes. I think part of this is going to be exercising part of this is going to be exercising part of this is going to be exercising uh due diligence and making sure that uh due diligence and making sure that uh due diligence and making sure that you can clearly document with the you can clearly document with the you can clearly document with the authorities that um you know you are authorities that um you know you are authorities that um you know you are testing for vulnerabilities during your testing for vulnerabilities during your testing for vulnerabilities during your build processes. you're testing them, build processes. you're testing them, build processes. you're testing them, uh, testing for vulnerabilities during uh, testing for vulnerabilities during uh, testing for vulnerabilities during your your test phases, your your quality your your test phases, your your quality your your test phases, your your quality control, and then it gets to a certain control, and then it gets to a certain control, and then it gets to a certain point where at that point, then you pass point where at that point, then you pass point where at that point, then you pass it off to your release processes, but it off to your release processes, but it off to your release processes, but you still have the continued testing and you still have the continued testing and you still have the continued testing and you have the continued awareness to be you have the continued awareness to be you have the continued awareness to be able to detect new vulnerabilities and able to detect new vulnerabilities and able to detect new vulnerabilities and you use rely on your vulnerability you use rely on your vulnerability you use rely on your vulnerability response uh, program to remediate those. Yes. Yes. But I think I think the the Yes. Yes. But I think I think the the Yes. Yes. But I think I think the the the biggest point is that the the biggest point is that the the biggest point is that the authorities were going to want to see authorities were going to want to see authorities were going to want to see that you've thought this program that you've thought this program that you've thought this program through. Uh one of the comments that through. Uh one of the comments that through. Uh one of the comments that being previously made is that earlier being previously made is that earlier being previously made is that earlier today is that the uh the authorities are today is that the uh the authorities are today is that the uh the authorities are not necessarily concerned about the not necessarily concerned about the not necessarily concerned about the nuances, right? And uh they just want to nuances, right? And uh they just want to nuances, right? And uh they just want to make sure that vendors are taking this make sure that vendors are taking this make sure that vendors are taking this seriously. Yes, Mike. way that it's been preached for the last way that it's been preached for the last way that it's been preached for the last 10 15 10 15 10 15 years. If you have to call a hold at years. If you have to call a hold at years. If you have to call a hold at some point, that means that you you show some point, that means that you you show some point, that means that you you show what you're doing. You can't just keep what you're doing. You can't just keep what you're doing. You can't just keep putting stuff out. No, I don't think putting stuff out. No, I don't think putting stuff out. No, I don't think it's an personally I don't think it's an it's an personally I don't think it's an it's an personally I don't think it's an end to CI/CD. I it's not an area that end to CI/CD. I it's not an area that end to CI/CD. I it's not an area that I'm really well verssed in, so I can't I'm really well verssed in, so I can't I'm really well verssed in, so I can't speak to it in too too much detail, but speak to it in too too much detail, but speak to it in too too much detail, but when you're looking to rapidly deploy when you're looking to rapidly deploy when you're looking to rapidly deploy functionality to a to a system, there's functionality to a to a system, there's functionality to a to a system, there's nothing stopping you from checking for nothing stopping you from checking for nothing stopping you from checking for existing vulnerabilities and patching existing vulnerabilities and patching existing vulnerabilities and patching those at the same time. Yes, time. Yes, time. Yes, that that is correct. Right. So there there's concepts of Right. So there there's concepts of Right. So there there's concepts of being placed on the market and being uh being placed on the market and being uh being placed on the market and being uh available on the market. Available on available on the market. Available on available on the market. Available on the market is the the time frame that the market is the the time frame that the market is the the time frame that you just mentioned. So if you're putting you just mentioned. So if you're putting you just mentioned. So if you're putting a product uh on the market on October, a product uh on the market on October, a product uh on the market on October, then yes, those requirements will apply then yes, those requirements will apply then yes, those requirements will apply as of as of as of December. Yes, Cassie. Sorry, could you repeat the question? I Sorry, could you repeat the question? I Sorry, could you repeat the question? I had difficulty hearing it. Okay. I wasn't aware that there is an Okay. I wasn't aware that there is an Okay. I wasn't aware that there is an implication of 7 by 24 report uh implication of 7 by 24 report uh implication of 7 by 24 report uh staffing. Um there are requirements for staffing. Um there are requirements for staffing. Um there are requirements for the the vulnerabilities whereby you can the the vulnerabilities whereby you can the the vulnerabilities whereby you can actually alert do an early notification actually alert do an early notification actually alert do an early notification 24 hours after discovery. Um I think 24 hours after discovery. Um I think 24 hours after discovery. Um I think that will follow your own internal processes. Any other questions? Yes. Yes. I believe the uh EUR uh or Yes. I believe the uh EUR uh or Yes. I believe the uh EUR uh or InSa I'm getting confused of the InSa I'm getting confused of the InSa I'm getting confused of the organization but there is already a organization but there is already a organization but there is already a recommended risk management framework recommended risk management framework recommended risk management framework that you can follow. Any more questions from the follow. Any more questions from the follow. Any more questions from the field field field Cassie? Okay. Well, thank you very much.
