Kind: captions Language: en Uh so we're uh gonna talk about Uh so we're uh gonna talk about Uh so we're uh gonna talk about vulnerability management in operational vulnerability management in operational vulnerability management in operational technology this morning. Uh my name is technology this morning. Uh my name is technology this morning. Uh my name is Kyling Ranahan. Uh I'm the CTO of a a Kyling Ranahan. Uh I'm the CTO of a a Kyling Ranahan. Uh I'm the CTO of a a company called Bazo. We do a company called Bazo. We do a company called Bazo. We do a vulnerability vulnerability vulnerability remediation and and remediation and and remediation and and prioritization for OOT. and I'll let prioritization for OOT. and I'll let prioritization for OOT. and I'll let Alice introduce himself. Alice introduce himself. Alice introduce himself. My name's Alex Asante. I'm a security My name's Alex Asante. I'm a security My name's Alex Asante. I'm a security consultant at a consultant at a consultant at a coming uh and that's my day job. My day coming uh and that's my day job. My day coming uh and that's my day job. My day job is working within the operational job is working within the operational job is working within the operational technology fields working do abilities technology fields working do abilities technology fields working do abilities and doing nurse science primarily but and doing nurse science primarily but and doing nurse science primarily but also doing other regulatory standards uh also doing other regulatory standards uh also doing other regulatory standards uh for operation knowledge with sher boss sug talk this this morning up about so I sug talk this this morning up about so I sug talk this this morning up about so I want to set your expectations here at want to set your expectations here at want to set your expectations here at start what this what this is we're going start what this what this is we're going start what this what this is we're going to talk about common problems we're to talk about common problems we're to talk about common problems we're going to talk about in particular why going to talk about in particular why going to talk about in particular why vulnerability management is is more vulnerability management is is more vulnerability management is is more difficult um than you would expect difficult um than you would expect difficult um than you would expect actually trying to run it past actually trying to run it past actually trying to run it past background and some reasons why it needs background and some reasons why it needs background and some reasons why it needs to be approached differently. What this to be approached differently. What this to be approached differently. What this is not it's not a nerk sip tutorial. If is not it's not a nerk sip tutorial. If is not it's not a nerk sip tutorial. If you don't know what nerk sip is, you're you don't know what nerk sip is, you're you don't know what nerk sip is, you're about to learn. So just get ready. Um, about to learn. So just get ready. Um, about to learn. So just get ready. Um, it's also not a technical technical deep it's also not a technical technical deep it's also not a technical technical deep deep stuff we're providing as an like an deep stuff we're providing as an like an deep stuff we're providing as an like an overview with hopefully enough detail to overview with hopefully enough detail to overview with hopefully enough detail to be to be helpful and not making you slog be to be helpful and not making you slog be to be helpful and not making you slog through all of the details. through all of the details. through all of the details. So what is OT? Uh it stands for So what is OT? Uh it stands for So what is OT? Uh it stands for operational technology. Yay. Power part operational technology. Yay. Power part operational technology. Yay. Power part two two two to about we're talking about systems to about we're talking about systems to about we're talking about systems that have uh physical consequences or that have uh physical consequences or that have uh physical consequences or deal with difficult in in environments deal with difficult in in environments deal with difficult in in environments as opposed to systems that or as opposed to systems that or as opposed to systems that or information technology are more information technology are more information technology are more activation. I sure love it when titled activation. I sure love it when titled activation. I sure love it when titled work. Uh you have terminology here work. Uh you have terminology here work. Uh you have terminology here uh clearer uh clearer uh clearer on BI you have ICS your industrial on BI you have ICS your industrial on BI you have ICS your industrial control systems again helpful term a control systems again helpful term a control systems again helpful term a system that controls an industrial system that controls an industrial system that controls an industrial process these are often used process these are often used process these are often used interchangeably of there's there's an interchangeably of there's there's an interchangeably of there's there's an overlap look at that in just a second overlap look at that in just a second overlap look at that in just a second many times these systems overlap with many times these systems overlap with many times these systems overlap with critical into a structure your systems critical into a structure your systems critical into a structure your systems are vital to national interests are vital to national interests are vital to national interests regardless of what nation that regardless of what nation that regardless of what nation that made. Uh in the in the states, SISA made. Uh in the in the states, SISA made. Uh in the in the states, SISA defined 16 critical infrastructure defined 16 critical infrastructure defined 16 critical infrastructure sectors. I'm not going to read them all sectors. I'm not going to read them all sectors. I'm not going to read them all to you. You have eyes. to you. You have eyes. to you. You have eyes. Um the older kind. Um many of of these Um the older kind. Um many of of these Um the older kind. Um many of of these are operational or industrial in are operational or industrial in are operational or industrial in environments things like the chemical environments things like the chemical environments things like the chemical sector, energy, dams, water, wastewater, sector, energy, dams, water, wastewater, sector, energy, dams, water, wastewater, transportation. Some of them are not. transportation. Some of them are not. transportation. Some of them are not. You'll notice there is one that it was You'll notice there is one that it was You'll notice there is one that it was just called information technology just called information technology just called information technology sector. That one is not a T. You're all sector. That one is not a T. You're all sector. That one is not a T. You're all smart people. I trust you know that. smart people. I trust you know that. smart people. I trust you know that. When we talk about terms, this is what I When we talk about terms, this is what I When we talk about terms, this is what I will call the vendive brand of will call the vendive brand of will call the vendive brand of terminology. I'm gonna give you some terminology. I'm gonna give you some terminology. I'm gonna give you some some examples and someone somewhere it's some examples and someone somewhere it's some examples and someone somewhere it's gonna find a case and they're gonna say gonna find a case and they're gonna say gonna find a case and they're gonna say we kind of fit in your diagram. I'm just we kind of fit in your diagram. I'm just we kind of fit in your diagram. I'm just gonna apologize in advance. It happens. gonna apologize in advance. It happens. gonna apologize in advance. It happens. Okay. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. ICS as sort of a subset of broader ICS as sort of a subset of broader ICS as sort of a subset of broader operational tech technology that operational tech technology that operational tech technology that overlaps with brittle infrastructure. overlaps with brittle infrastructure. overlaps with brittle infrastructure. For example, our electric grid sits For example, our electric grid sits For example, our electric grid sits right there in the middle of all right there in the middle of all right there in the middle of all all three. Healthcare is critical all three. Healthcare is critical all three. Healthcare is critical infrastructure. It is operational infrastructure. It is operational infrastructure. It is operational technology. You can look at an MRI technology. You can look at an MRI technology. You can look at an MRI machine. There are physical components machine. There are physical components machine. There are physical components moving around there. An MRI machine, I moving around there. An MRI machine, I moving around there. An MRI machine, I would say, is not an industrial control would say, is not an industrial control would say, is not an industrial control system. Doesn't mean doesn't still have system. Doesn't mean doesn't still have system. Doesn't mean doesn't still have some of the difficulties, right? There some of the difficulties, right? There some of the difficulties, right? There comes a point where splitting the isn't comes a point where splitting the isn't comes a point where splitting the isn't helpful but to give you some helpful but to give you some helpful but to give you some examples. The financial sector is examples. The financial sector is examples. The financial sector is critical infrastructure is not OT or critical infrastructure is not OT or critical infrastructure is not OT or ICS. And then we have something in here ICS. And then we have something in here ICS. And then we have something in here like non critical manu manufacturing. If like non critical manu manufacturing. If like non critical manu manufacturing. If you're wondering why I use that term, you're wondering why I use that term, you're wondering why I use that term, it's because it's because it's because uh critical manufacturing pointer it is uh critical manufacturing pointer it is uh critical manufacturing pointer it is critical manufacturing is one of our our critical manufacturing is one of our our critical manufacturing is one of our our citers right here. So non-critical citers right here. So non-critical citers right here. So non-critical manufacturing would go outside of that manufacturing would go outside of that manufacturing would go outside of that overlap. The last one I'll give you is overlap. The last one I'll give you is overlap. The last one I'll give you is HFAC very heating cooling air system HFAC very heating cooling air system HFAC very heating cooling air system which I'll put right on the line. You which I'll put right on the line. You which I'll put right on the line. You could call it ICS. You could call it not could call it ICS. You could call it not could call it ICS. You could call it not not ICS. And you're you're kind of right not ICS. And you're you're kind of right not ICS. And you're you're kind of right either way. Um it is not for the blink either way. Um it is not for the blink either way. Um it is not for the blink structure. Although living in Arkansas, structure. Although living in Arkansas, structure. Although living in Arkansas, I would argue that it is. I would argue that it is. I would argue that it is. Um just saying, but um it's not Um just saying, but um it's not Um just saying, but um it's not necessarily vital to national in in necessarily vital to national in in necessarily vital to national in in interests. As we get into some of the interests. As we get into some of the interests. As we get into some of the differences here, I want to talk about differences here, I want to talk about differences here, I want to talk about the CIA triad for quarter a second. your the CIA triad for quarter a second. your the CIA triad for quarter a second. your very standard confidentiality integrity very standard confidentiality integrity very standard confidentiality integrity of of availability. The first slide in of of availability. The first slide in of of availability. The first slide in any infosc class um it's when people any infosc class um it's when people any infosc class um it's when people talk about OT's the first thing you'll talk about OT's the first thing you'll talk about OT's the first thing you'll you'll often hear and many times you'll you'll often hear and many times you'll you'll often hear and many times you'll hear this for some for someone coming hear this for some for someone coming hear this for some for someone coming from uh a IT or security background from uh a IT or security background from uh a IT or security background looking at OT like easy you just flip it looking at OT like easy you just flip it looking at OT like easy you just flip it uh uh uh availability is the most important as availability is the most important as availability is the most important as opposed to confidentiality um that is opposed to confidentiality um that is opposed to confidentiality um that is not incorrect um but I want I want to a not incorrect um but I want I want to a not incorrect um but I want I want to a little bit more more specific because little bit more more specific because little bit more more specific because we're really looking at a different we're really looking at a different we're really looking at a different perspective. When these systems are perspective. When these systems are perspective. When these systems are built, you're not considering built, you're not considering built, you're not considering necessarily your CIA triad. You're necessarily your CIA triad. You're necessarily your CIA triad. You're considering safety, reliability, and considering safety, reliability, and considering safety, reliability, and performance. Now, when people say we performance. Now, when people say we performance. Now, when people say we just flip the triad, availability is just flip the triad, availability is just flip the triad, availability is key. This is really what they mean. this key. This is really what they mean. this key. This is really what they mean. this system staying up. If you're an electric system staying up. If you're an electric system staying up. If you're an electric grid, providing reliable power every grid, providing reliable power every grid, providing reliable power every time someone flicks a a light switch, time someone flicks a a light switch, time someone flicks a a light switch, you could say that it's typical of the you could say that it's typical of the you could say that it's typical of the building. So, I'm going to say they're building. So, I'm going to say they're building. So, I'm going to say they're not wrong. But when they're building, not wrong. But when they're building, not wrong. But when they're building, designing operating systems, these are designing operating systems, these are designing operating systems, these are the things that are most important. So the things that are most important. So the things that are most important. So if you're talking with if you're talking with if you're talking with operators particularly in a in an operators particularly in a in an operators particularly in a in an environment that does not have a environment that does not have a environment that does not have a dedicated security team, you're talking dedicated security team, you're talking dedicated security team, you're talking about cyber about cyber about cyber security and you have to know or security and you have to know or security and you have to know or remember these principles to be able to remember these principles to be able to remember these principles to be able to com communicate com communicate com communicate effectively. Uh Al is going to talk effectively. Uh Al is going to talk effectively. Uh Al is going to talk about some of the differences that that about some of the differences that that about some of the differences that that we we see in these parts. I know. So as I start off here you know I know. So as I start off here you know I know. So as I start off here you know a lot of the operational technologies a lot of the operational technologies a lot of the operational technologies that we're going to talk about are util that we're going to talk about are util that we're going to talk about are util there are electrical utilities there are there are electrical utilities there are there are electrical utilities there are gas utilities there are oil utilities gas utilities there are oil utilities gas utilities there are oil utilities there are water utilities chemical there are water utilities chemical there are water utilities chemical utilities law utilities out there and utilities law utilities out there and utilities law utilities out there and that's what we're looking at in that's what we're looking at in that's what we're looking at in operational technology but the important operational technology but the important operational technology but the important thing to remember here is that the thing to remember here is that the thing to remember here is that the priority of utility is a little bit priority of utility is a little bit priority of utility is a little bit different than you might have than IT different than you might have than IT different than you might have than IT world or any other world out there you world or any other world out there you world or any other world out there you know the first priority is going to be know the first priority is going to be know the first priority is going to be operations and reliability right a power operations and reliability right a power operations and reliability right a power plant has to be on has grinding power plant has to be on has grinding power plant has to be on has grinding power when you know all the time we're always when you know all the time we're always when you know all the time we're always using powerful whether it's you know using powerful whether it's you know using powerful whether it's you know even even at night in our homes you know even even at night in our homes you know even even at night in our homes you know in our at work we're we're constantly in our at work we're we're constantly in our at work we're we're constantly consuming electricity we need those consuming electricity we need those consuming electricity we need those power plants online right then you have power plants online right then you have power plants online right then you have safety being chi and critical you know safety being chi and critical you know safety being chi and critical you know if a power plant explodes in the middle if a power plant explodes in the middle if a power plant explodes in the middle of night we got a big problem um you of night we got a big problem um you of night we got a big problem um you know the network might crash you know know the network might crash you know know the network might crash you know that could be a different story but if that could be a different story but if that could be a different story but if something goes boom when you're working something goes boom when you're working something goes boom when you're working with gas working with power you're with gas working with power you're with gas working with power you're working with electrons you know that working with electrons you know that working with electrons you know that could be a big problem and so that's could be a big problem and so that's could be a big problem and so that's going to be a second priority that a lot going to be a second priority that a lot going to be a second priority that a lot of us studies face and finally security of us studies face and finally security of us studies face and finally security you know security is key and important you know security is key and important you know security is key and important but it's a balance right what cyber but it's a balance right what cyber but it's a balance right what cyber security that's critical for ensuring security that's critical for ensuring security that's critical for ensuring safe reliable operations we're not doing safe reliable operations we're not doing safe reliable operations we're not doing security for security it's about security for security it's about security for security it's about managing the risks and not chasing managing the risks and not chasing managing the risks and not chasing perfection if it's a balance is perfection if it's a balance is perfection if it's a balance is necessary and we'll more into that here necessary and we'll more into that here necessary and we'll more into that here later so when we're talking about what's later so when we're talking about what's later so when we're talking about what's at stake you know biggest things here at stake you know biggest things here at stake you know biggest things here that utility priorities that I mentioned that utility priorities that I mentioned that utility priorities that I mentioned before the operational reliability before the operational reliability before the operational reliability safety and security you know Dave or safety and security you know Dave or safety and security you know Dave or Flyer vulnerability management and a Flyer vulnerability management and a Flyer vulnerability management and a robust approach you know caching isn't robust approach you know caching isn't robust approach you know caching isn't just about security or compliance which just about security or compliance which just about security or compliance which we're going to get into grip day it's we're going to get into grip day it's we're going to get into grip day it's about keeping the lights on it's about about keeping the lights on it's about about keeping the lights on it's about making sure that these critical sectors making sure that these critical sectors making sure that these critical sectors are there and available for when they're are there and available for when they're are there and available for when they're needed necessary and making sure that needed necessary and making sure that needed necessary and making sure that we're keeping them we're keeping them we're keeping them secure so you know to give an example uh secure so you know to give an example uh secure so you know to give an example uh but don't think we're going to be but don't think we're going to be but don't think we're going to be talking about talking about talking about beer. It's important to kind of frame beer. It's important to kind of frame beer. It's important to kind of frame your mind. We're talking about no tea your mind. We're talking about no tea your mind. We're talking about no tea versus diet and talking about why is, versus diet and talking about why is, versus diet and talking about why is, you know, why does it matter? Why is it you know, why does it matter? Why is it you know, why does it matter? Why is it different? You know, what are some of different? You know, what are some of different? You know, what are some of the different challenges? U one of the the different challenges? U one of the the different challenges? U one of the examples here today is that compliance, examples here today is that compliance, examples here today is that compliance, regulation, regulation, regulation, security can be a little bit different. security can be a little bit different. security can be a little bit different. We change our perspectives here. When We change our perspectives here. When We change our perspectives here. When we're talking about compliance, there we're talking about compliance, there we're talking about compliance, there is, you know, not necessarily a focus on is, you know, not necessarily a focus on is, you know, not necessarily a focus on revenue. Of course, every company needs revenue. Of course, every company needs revenue. Of course, every company needs to make money. So, that is important. to make money. So, that is important. to make money. So, that is important. But with compliance, be compliant to But with compliance, be compliant to But with compliance, be compliant to these standards. And compliance to the these standards. And compliance to the these standards. And compliance to the standards can also result in, you know, standards can also result in, you know, standards can also result in, you know, result in revenue and also result in result in revenue and also result in result in revenue and also result in fines, fees, and other problems as we're fines, fees, and other problems as we're fines, fees, and other problems as we're going to get into later. to kind of give going to get into later. to kind of give going to get into later. to kind of give you an idea of some of the impact of you an idea of some of the impact of you an idea of some of the impact of this. There was a generation facility um this. There was a generation facility um this. There was a generation facility um that I've worked on and been to and one that I've worked on and been to and one that I've worked on and been to and one day they had an outage that was day they had an outage that was day they had an outage that was unscheduled and unplanned uh for various unscheduled and unplanned uh for various unscheduled and unplanned uh for various reasons. They could not go online and reasons. They could not go online and reasons. They could not go online and the independent system operator and the independent system operator and the independent system operator and balance authority for the region asked balance authority for the region asked balance authority for the region asked them to turn them to turn them to turn on. Now this region asked them to turn on. Now this region asked them to turn on. Now this region asked them to turn on for five 20 minute windows. So they on for five 20 minute windows. So they on for five 20 minute windows. So they were only V2B on that day for a total of were only V2B on that day for a total of were only V2B on that day for a total of just under two hours of time producing just under two hours of time producing just under two hours of time producing power. They were not able to turn on and power. They were not able to turn on and power. They were not able to turn on and because of that the region ended up because of that the region ended up because of that the region ended up giving them millions of dollars in buys giving them millions of dollars in buys giving them millions of dollars in buys and fees just on top of the lost revenue and fees just on top of the lost revenue and fees just on top of the lost revenue from this company. That means that the from this company. That means that the from this company. That means that the it shows you that the availability of it shows you that the availability of it shows you that the availability of these resources is important, right? And these resources is important, right? And these resources is important, right? And so when we're talking about her day so when we're talking about her day so when we're talking about her day management and talking about, you know, management and talking about, you know, management and talking about, you know, making sure that our time, you know, making sure that our time, you know, making sure that our time, you know, we're looking at the right time windows, we're looking at the right time windows, we're looking at the right time windows, we're looking at the right assets, we're we're looking at the right assets, we're we're looking at the right assets, we're looking at right priorities here, you looking at right priorities here, you looking at right priorities here, you know, it's key to remember that one of know, it's key to remember that one of know, it's key to remember that one of the biggest aspects you have to focus on the biggest aspects you have to focus on the biggest aspects you have to focus on is availability because availability is is availability because availability is is availability because availability is crucial in this space. So a little bit crucial in this space. So a little bit crucial in this space. So a little bit of why there start compliance and of why there start compliance and of why there start compliance and regulation piece of it. Now if you're in regulation piece of it. Now if you're in regulation piece of it. Now if you're in a regulated industry, this is your a regulated industry, this is your a regulated industry, this is your everything, right? This is what you have everything, right? This is what you have everything, right? This is what you have to deal with. This is what you do. If to deal with. This is what you do. If to deal with. This is what you do. If you're you're you're unregulated, we'll go back to this unregulated, we'll go back to this unregulated, we'll go back to this later, but don't worry, you might do later, but don't worry, you might do later, but don't worry, you might do what I say. Uh that we're better over what I say. Uh that we're better over what I say. Uh that we're better over works. You know, if you're a researcher, works. You know, if you're a researcher, works. You know, if you're a researcher, you know, this is important. You you're you know, this is important. You you're you know, this is important. You you're helping keep things secure. We want all helping keep things secure. We want all helping keep things secure. We want all the researchers here to be looking at, the researchers here to be looking at, the researchers here to be looking at, you know, the IT world and the OT world you know, the IT world and the OT world you know, the IT world and the OT world at a full hard mindset. You know, there at a full hard mindset. You know, there at a full hard mindset. You know, there are key differences that are important are key differences that are important are key differences that are important to understand making sure that, you to understand making sure that, you to understand making sure that, you know, the research is benefiting not know, the research is benefiting not know, the research is benefiting not just the IT world, but also benefiting just the IT world, but also benefiting just the IT world, but also benefiting the OT world alongside. And of course, the OT world alongside. And of course, the OT world alongside. And of course, here we have, you know, here we have, you know, here we have, you know, You know what? You know why you're here. You know what? You know why you're here. You know what? You know why you're here. You're helping provide all the assets, You're helping provide all the assets, You're helping provide all the assets, the resources, and the time to make sure the resources, and the time to make sure the resources, and the time to make sure that this all this all works. So, the OT that this all this all works. So, the OT that this all this all works. So, the OT reality check as I've been talking reality check as I've been talking reality check as I've been talking through is just reliability first, through is just reliability first, through is just reliability first, right? We have continuous operations, we right? We have continuous operations, we right? We have continuous operations, we need availability, and all of these need availability, and all of these need availability, and all of these require cyber require cyber require cyber security and all these things, right? security and all these things, right? security and all these things, right? We're going to go through many key We're going to go through many key We're going to go through many key things such as maintenance and succiability and safety that takes succiability and safety that takes succiability and safety that takes prese. So we're talking about provide prese. So we're talking about provide prese. So we're talking about provide overly management far in the overly management far in the overly management far in the space. There's a couple different very space. There's a couple different very space. There's a couple different very common problems and themes here such as common problems and themes here such as common problems and themes here such as non-homogeneous environments. You know non-homogeneous environments. You know non-homogeneous environments. You know in the IT world you might see a facility in the IT world you might see a facility in the IT world you might see a facility with thousand devices that might only with thousand devices that might only with thousand devices that might only use five OSS and five vendums in the IT use five OSS and five vendums in the IT use five OSS and five vendums in the IT space but in the OT space you might see space but in the OT space you might see space but in the OT space you might see a general facility with only 250 assets a general facility with only 250 assets a general facility with only 250 assets right much smaller scale however those right much smaller scale however those right much smaller scale however those 250 assets use 30 different vendors 250 assets use 30 different vendors 250 assets use 30 different vendors technologies and 12 different OS right technologies and 12 different OS right technologies and 12 different OS right when you start looking at patch when you start looking at patch when you start looking at patch management and doing a patch roll out in management and doing a patch roll out in management and doing a patch roll out in a much bigger problem you're doing 200 a much bigger problem you're doing 200 a much bigger problem you're doing 200 assets with just different technology assets with just different technology assets with just different technology versus when you're looking at many many versus when you're looking at many many versus when you're looking at many many many more assets but only OSS and agile many more assets but only OSS and agile many more assets but only OSS and agile some becomes a little bit easier. you some becomes a little bit easier. you some becomes a little bit easier. you know, when you were looking at, you know, when you were looking at, you know, when you were looking at, you know, the different asset discoveries know, the different asset discoveries know, the different asset discoveries and different asset managements and different asset managements and different asset managements principle, you know, depending on the principle, you know, depending on the principle, you know, depending on the criticality of your assets and depending criticality of your assets and depending criticality of your assets and depending on, you know, what regulations you you on, you know, what regulations you you on, you know, what regulations you you have, you might have to keep asset have, you might have to keep asset have, you might have to keep asset lists, you might not. Either way, even lists, you might not. Either way, even lists, you might not. Either way, even if you have asset lists or enough in if you have asset lists or enough in if you have asset lists or enough in your system all the time, you see it's your system all the time, you see it's your system all the time, you see it's common that without robust asset common that without robust asset common that without robust asset management systems in place, it is super management systems in place, it is super management systems in place, it is super easy to miss an asset. Even with robust easy to miss an asset. Even with robust easy to miss an asset. Even with robust but things in place, it is super super but things in place, it is super super but things in place, it is super super easy to miss an asset and to realize easy to miss an asset and to realize easy to miss an asset and to realize you're not patching assets because you're not patching assets because you're not patching assets because you're not doing mitigation all these you're not doing mitigation all these you're not doing mitigation all these places because again going back to places because again going back to places because again going back to nonogous environments, we're working nonogous environments, we're working nonogous environments, we're working with 250 assets using all sorts of with 250 assets using all sorts of with 250 assets using all sorts of different technologies all in a pactive different technologies all in a pactive different technologies all in a pactive and different space in over different and different space in over different and different space in over different reasons. reasons. reasons. Now, when talking about end of life, end Now, when talking about end of life, end Now, when talking about end of life, end of sale systems in the OT world, it is of sale systems in the OT world, it is of sale systems in the OT world, it is very very very common to see devices very very very common to see devices very very very common to see devices that are end of life, end of sale and that are end of life, end of sale and that are end of life, end of sale and support and definitely legacy systems uh support and definitely legacy systems uh support and definitely legacy systems uh for many different reasons. Um some for many different reasons. Um some for many different reasons. Um some being that of course there's not being that of course there's not being that of course there's not necessarily good there's not a necessarily good there's not a necessarily good there's not a replacement out there market. Um, I've replacement out there market. Um, I've replacement out there market. Um, I've seen multiple times at facilities that seen multiple times at facilities that seen multiple times at facilities that have an asset that breaks down and they have an asset that breaks down and they have an asset that breaks down and they have required using the gray markets to have required using the gray markets to have required using the gray markets to actually replace a device. I can't tell actually replace a device. I can't tell actually replace a device. I can't tell you how many times I've seen eBay pulled you how many times I've seen eBay pulled you how many times I've seen eBay pulled up my haunted computer trying to find up my haunted computer trying to find up my haunted computer trying to find the right asset to replace that the right asset to replace that the right asset to replace that generation facility because they're just generation facility because they're just generation facility because they're just not a good replacement out there and not a good replacement out there and not a good replacement out there and they have to go find Alexi systems and they have to go find Alexi systems and they have to go find Alexi systems and you know to kind of give everyone a you know to kind of give everyone a you know to kind of give everyone a little bit of perspective from that little bit of perspective from that little bit of perspective from that legacy here. You know, in my three years legacy here. You know, in my three years legacy here. You know, in my three years working with a bunch of utilities, I working with a bunch of utilities, I working with a bunch of utilities, I personally have seen out the field personally have seen out the field personally have seen out the field running critical assets and running just running critical assets and running just running critical assets and running just important assets to a lot of different important assets to a lot of different important assets to a lot of different utilities. I've seen Windows 7, Windows utilities. I've seen Windows 7, Windows utilities. I've seen Windows 7, Windows XP, right? Nothing too crazy or Windows XP, right? Nothing too crazy or Windows XP, right? Nothing too crazy or Windows Force. I've also seen Windows Force. I've also seen Windows Force. I've also seen Windows NT93 and Windows 3.1 running for key NT93 and Windows 3.1 running for key NT93 and Windows 3.1 running for key important assets that are operating your important assets that are operating your important assets that are operating your grid, operating your gas, operating as grid, operating your gas, operating as grid, operating your gas, operating as oil, operating your water, and operating oil, operating your water, and operating oil, operating your water, and operating all these different things. You know, all these different things. You know, all these different things. You know, it's important to realize that we're not it's important to realize that we're not it's important to realize that we're not just working with brand new systems, just working with brand new systems, just working with brand new systems, systems that were easy to replace, you systems that were easy to replace, you systems that were easy to replace, you know, hot swap. We're working with know, hot swap. We're working with know, hot swap. We're working with sometimes a lot of devices that have no sometimes a lot of devices that have no sometimes a lot of devices that have no good replacements run on really old good replacements run on really old good replacements run on really old software. And it's going to be really software. And it's going to be really software. And it's going to be really important when it comes down important when it comes down important when it comes down to need creative and making sure you can to need creative and making sure you can to need creative and making sure you can handle those different touch devices, handle those different touch devices, handle those different touch devices, especially with all the techniques. especially with all the techniques. especially with all the techniques. Now again another G impact here is Now again another G impact here is Now again another G impact here is devices for operation and not for devices for operation and not for devices for operation and not for security. While the OQ we use a lot of security. While the OQ we use a lot of security. While the OQ we use a lot of it asset right we use switch from use a it asset right we use switch from use a it asset right we use switch from use a lot of sync things we also use different lot of sync things we also use different lot of sync things we also use different things such as a relay that's going to things such as a relay that's going to things such as a relay that's going to operate a breaker this would be mainly a operate a breaker this would be mainly a operate a breaker this would be mainly a job for operation a shas to make sure job for operation a shas to make sure job for operation a shas to make sure that breaker opens or closes to prevent that breaker opens or closes to prevent that breaker opens or closes to prevent it fault down the line to make sure we it fault down the line to make sure we it fault down the line to make sure we can keep power running. Now that device can keep power running. Now that device can keep power running. Now that device might do really good at it job and might do really good at it job and might do really good at it job and really good at operating but that device really good at operating but that device really good at operating but that device might be very bad at security. It might might be very bad at security. It might might be very bad at security. It might have weak password controls which is have weak password controls which is have weak password controls which is super common. No certificants. No we can super common. No certificants. No we can super common. No certificants. No we can right none of these security controls or right none of these security controls or right none of these security controls or measures that we're used to in an IT measures that we're used to in an IT measures that we're used to in an IT world. You know it's often missing on OT world. You know it's often missing on OT world. You know it's often missing on OT assets. And so we have to make sure that assets. And so we have to make sure that assets. And so we have to make sure that when we're looking at our build when we're looking at our build when we're looking at our build mitigation we're taking that into mitigation we're taking that into mitigation we're taking that into account that we might not have the account that we might not have the account that we might not have the license controls on these devices. And license controls on these devices. And license controls on these devices. And so we have to make sure if you can so we have to make sure if you can so we have to make sure if you can mitigate that some other mitigate that some other mitigate that some other way. Now geographical dispersion can be way. Now geographical dispersion can be way. Now geographical dispersion can be as problem and this depends on what kind as problem and this depends on what kind as problem and this depends on what kind of utility you are, what kind of of utility you are, what kind of of utility you are, what kind of services you provide, what kind of services you provide, what kind of services you provide, what kind of assets you use. Um the biggest example assets you use. Um the biggest example assets you use. Um the biggest example for this is going to be if you are for this is going to be if you are for this is going to be if you are electric utility especially your electric utility especially your electric utility especially your distribution or chain commission you're distribution or chain commission you're distribution or chain commission you're going to have a lot of substations right going to have a lot of substations right going to have a lot of substations right and at the substations you're going to and at the substations you're going to and at the substations you're going to have anywhere let's say from 10 to 200 have anywhere let's say from 10 to 200 have anywhere let's say from 10 to 200 assets worth. assets worth. assets worth. Now when you look at it, okay, I got one Now when you look at it, okay, I got one Now when you look at it, okay, I got one substation, 200 assets. Great, that's substation, 200 assets. Great, that's substation, 200 assets. Great, that's one. Now let's add in the other 500 one. Now let's add in the other 500 one. Now let's add in the other 500 substations that I and across all of substations that I and across all of substations that I and across all of those different assets. I might have those different assets. I might have those different assets. I might have assets spread over tens of thousands of assets spread over tens of thousands of assets spread over tens of thousands of square miles across different states square miles across different states square miles across different states across different regions and sometime across different regions and sometime across different regions and sometime across, you know, country bulk lines, across, you know, country bulk lines, across, you know, country bulk lines, right? It's very common the right? It's very common the right? It's very common the interactivity of the marquees to have a interactivity of the marquees to have a interactivity of the marquees to have a Canadian power company that's connected Canadian power company that's connected Canadian power company that's connected um into the US and they have a few um into the US and they have a few um into the US and they have a few assets reside in the US not right and so assets reside in the US not right and so assets reside in the US not right and so a lot of these assets especially in this a lot of these assets especially in this a lot of these assets especially in this space have to be cash manually right and space have to be cash manually right and space have to be cash manually right and when you have to do manual patching and when you have to do manual patching and when you have to do manual patching and now you're looking at your assets spread now you're looking at your assets spread now you're looking at your assets spread out over tens of thousands of square out over tens of thousands of square out over tens of thousands of square miles that becomes a much bigger problem miles that becomes a much bigger problem miles that becomes a much bigger problem uh the next project of course is the uh the next project of course is the uh the next project of course is the availability again talking about how You availability again talking about how You availability again talking about how You have to be available, right? have to be available, right? have to be available, right? Availability is kind of almost twofold. Availability is kind of almost twofold. Availability is kind of almost twofold. You know, how many of you in this You know, how many of you in this You know, how many of you in this criminal would be comfortable if your criminal would be comfortable if your criminal would be comfortable if your power company said, "Okay, guys, sorry. power company said, "Okay, guys, sorry. power company said, "Okay, guys, sorry. We're going have to turn off your lights We're going have to turn off your lights We're going have to turn off your lights for immediate evil, right?" Sadly, you know, immediate evil, right?" Sadly, you know, immediate evil, right?" Sadly, you know, personally, I wouldn't be willing to do personally, I wouldn't be willing to do personally, I wouldn't be willing to do that. You know, I left my power. I like that. You know, I left my power. I like that. You know, I left my power. I like being able to do my dishes at night, run being able to do my dishes at night, run being able to do my dishes at night, run the laundry, watch TV, all those fun the laundry, watch TV, all those fun the laundry, watch TV, all those fun things. things. things. Um, but you know, you have to be Um, but you know, you have to be Um, but you know, you have to be available. Your gas company can't just available. Your gas company can't just available. Your gas company can't just turn off your gas and do a passport turn off your gas and do a passport turn off your gas and do a passport shield, right? The availability is key. shield, right? The availability is key. shield, right? The availability is key. And from the incentive value, of course, And from the incentive value, of course, And from the incentive value, of course, if you're merchant generation, your if you're merchant generation, your if you're merchant generation, your availability is your key money maker. If availability is your key money maker. If availability is your key money maker. If you're there, you're making money. If you're there, you're making money. If you're there, you're making money. If you're on, you're making money. you're on, you're making money. you're on, you're making money. Availability can also be a problem if Availability can also be a problem if Availability can also be a problem if you're not available. Like I mean I you're not available. Like I mean I you're not available. Like I mean I mentioned before, they weren't available mentioned before, they weren't available mentioned before, they weren't available for two almost two hours of a single day for two almost two hours of a single day for two almost two hours of a single day and they lost millions of dollars in and they lost millions of dollars in and they lost millions of dollars in fines and fees, not to even do the fines and fees, not to even do the fines and fees, not to even do the revenue they lost for not being there, revenue they lost for not being there, revenue they lost for not being there, right? availability is key. It's right? availability is key. It's right? availability is key. It's important in the OT space is a much important in the OT space is a much important in the OT space is a much bigger problem. You know, while you bigger problem. You know, while you bigger problem. You know, while you might have in the IT world, a let's say might have in the IT world, a let's say might have in the IT world, a let's say Saturday night is my time for patching. Saturday night is my time for patching. Saturday night is my time for patching. Everything the services pause for three Everything the services pause for three Everything the services pause for three hours while I do a lot of patchets. hours while I do a lot of patchets. hours while I do a lot of patchets. That's great. I can't do that on power That's great. I can't do that on power That's great. I can't do that on power utility. I can't drive off with power utility. I can't drive off with power utility. I can't drive off with power for three hours. You know, I have to for three hours. You know, I have to for three hours. You know, I have to have availability for outage windows and have availability for outage windows and have availability for outage windows and schedules, which becomes a much bigger schedules, which becomes a much bigger schedules, which becomes a much bigger problem, especially when you look at problem, especially when you look at problem, especially when you look at vendor maintenance, right? We're looking vendor maintenance, right? We're looking vendor maintenance, right? We're looking at vendor maintenance. You know, we at vendor maintenance. You know, we at vendor maintenance. You know, we might have to have certain key aspects might have to have certain key aspects might have to have certain key aspects and critical systems that vendors only and critical systems that vendors only and critical systems that vendors only only the vendors are allowed to work the only the vendors are allowed to work the only the vendors are allowed to work the machines or we have to use the vendors machines or we have to use the vendors machines or we have to use the vendors to get patches or you need the vendors to get patches or you need the vendors to get patches or you need the vendors to do all these sort of things for us to do all these sort of things for us to do all these sort of things for us and running these plants. You know, when and running these plants. You know, when and running these plants. You know, when it comes down to the availability of it comes down to the availability of it comes down to the availability of vendors, the availability of their vendors, the availability of their vendors, the availability of their technicians, the availability of our technicians, the availability of our technicians, the availability of our technicians, right? It becomes really technicians, right? It becomes really technicians, right? It becomes really difficult. We're looking at that difficult. We're looking at that difficult. We're looking at that availability window which is say, hey, availability window which is say, hey, availability window which is say, hey, when can I turn off my power? When can I when can I turn off my power? When can I when can I turn off my power? When can I turn off my gas services? When can I get turn off my gas services? When can I get turn off my gas services? When can I get this work done? this work done? this work done? Because when we're looking at it, you Because when we're looking at it, you Because when we're looking at it, you know, it just become there's so many know, it just become there's so many know, it just become there's so many things that go into it, right? At a things that go into it, right? At a things that go into it, right? At a substation, you might have outage substation, you might have outage substation, you might have outage windows that are large, but typically windows that are large, but typically windows that are large, but typically only when you're retrofitting a only when you're retrofitting a only when you're retrofitting a substation, right? Post the outage substation, right? Post the outage substation, right? Post the outage window if you're at a substation small window if you're at a substation small window if you're at a substation small windows because again, you need power. windows because again, you need power. windows because again, you need power. So, you need it there. While you might So, you need it there. While you might So, you need it there. While you might go out power, you know, through another go out power, you know, through another go out power, you know, through another substation for a brief period of time substation for a brief period of time substation for a brief period of time while you're having patching, you know, while you're having patching, you know, while you're having patching, you know, you want that backed up for the you want that backed up for the you want that backed up for the reliability and resilience of the reliability and resilience of the reliability and resilience of the bridge, right? If you're looking at a bridge, right? If you're looking at a bridge, right? If you're looking at a generation facility, we often have generation facility, we often have generation facility, we often have what's called uh the shoulder month or what's called uh the shoulder month or what's called uh the shoulder month or the shoulder season where when it's not the shoulder season where when it's not the shoulder season where when it's not hot and it's not cold, that power hot and it's not cold, that power hot and it's not cold, that power company can finally take an outage that company can finally take an outage that company can finally take an outage that power, you know, that generation. So, power, you know, that generation. So, power, you know, that generation. So, finally turn off their generators and finally turn off their generators and finally turn off their generators and say, "Okay, great. You know, we have we say, "Okay, great. You know, we have we say, "Okay, great. You know, we have we need you to go do all this maintenance, need you to go do all this maintenance, need you to go do all this maintenance, all this stuff patching. We need you to all this stuff patching. We need you to all this stuff patching. We need you to go and place all these different go and place all these different go and place all these different systems. We need to get ready for the systems. We need to get ready for the systems. We need to get ready for the next solar season for the next season of next solar season for the next season of next solar season for the next season of heating of cooling of power because we heating of cooling of power because we heating of cooling of power because we have a limited time windows when we can have a limited time windows when we can have a limited time windows when we can actually get in and dup these averages actually get in and dup these averages actually get in and dup these averages which there's a lot of key components which there's a lot of key components which there's a lot of key components and problems that just are so different. and problems that just are so different. and problems that just are so different. That's of course we get to regulation. That's of course we get to regulation. That's of course we get to regulation. Uh but to get regulation it is becomes a Uh but to get regulation it is becomes a Uh but to get regulation it is becomes a much bigger problem you know because much bigger problem you know because much bigger problem you know because there is a game of compliance versus there is a game of compliance versus there is a game of compliance versus security. Remember compliance does not security. Remember compliance does not security. Remember compliance does not equal security and security does not equal security and security does not equal security and security does not equal compliance and that's in tuned equal compliance and that's in tuned equal compliance and that's in tuned ones right you can be secure not ones right you can be secure not ones right you can be secure not compliant and vice versa but you know compliant and vice versa but you know compliant and vice versa but you know regulatory standards and cyber threats regulatory standards and cyber threats regulatory standards and cyber threats are always evolving and that's are always evolving and that's are always evolving and that's definitely not always in parallel often definitely not always in parallel often definitely not always in parallel often not your regulations are often lagging not your regulations are often lagging not your regulations are often lagging behind the cyber threats you're catching behind the cyber threats you're catching behind the cyber threats you're catching up to the new and improved cyber threats up to the new and improved cyber threats up to the new and improved cyber threats years sometimes even decades later um years sometimes even decades later um years sometimes even decades later um your regulations now and one of the your regulations now and one of the your regulations now and one of the largest challenges in regulatory largest challenges in regulatory largest challenges in regulatory compliance can be sometimes the compliance can be sometimes the compliance can be sometimes the interpretation. So, a lot of these interpretation. So, a lot of these interpretation. So, a lot of these standards can be written open-ended and standards can be written open-ended and standards can be written open-ended and that's both the strength and the that's both the strength and the that's both the strength and the weakness, right? You know, the strength weakness, right? You know, the strength weakness, right? You know, the strength allows the flexibility and confine to allows the flexibility and confine to allows the flexibility and confine to the standard, right? We're not we're not the standard, right? We're not we're not the standard, right? We're not we're not going to expect the 10 person mom and going to expect the 10 person mom and going to expect the 10 person mom and pop generation shop to have the exact pop generation shop to have the exact pop generation shop to have the exact same appliance program, do the exact same appliance program, do the exact same appliance program, do the exact same things and be the exact same things same things and be the exact same things same things and be the exact same things as a 10,000 employee, you know, uh as a 10,000 employee, you know, uh as a 10,000 employee, you know, uh utility company that 500 substations for utility company that 500 substations for utility company that 500 substations for nuclear facilities, all the extended nuclear facilities, all the extended nuclear facilities, all the extended banks, right? We need flexibility in the banks, right? We need flexibility in the banks, right? We need flexibility in the standards. We need that interpretation standards. We need that interpretation standards. We need that interpretation for flex for flexibility so that for flex for flexibility so that for flex for flexibility so that everyone can follow these counts. everyone can follow these counts. everyone can follow these counts. And you know another strength from it is And you know another strength from it is And you know another strength from it is it's offers a minimum level security it's offers a minimum level security it's offers a minimum level security when you're working in the compliance when you're working in the compliance when you're working in the compliance world you often and sometimes see you world you often and sometimes see you world you often and sometimes see you know let's do the minimum look let's know let's do the minimum look let's know let's do the minimum look let's check the box right we are compliant do check the box right we are compliant do check the box right we are compliant do what we have to do check that box become what we have to do check that box become what we have to do check that box become compliant and move on right and for compliant and move on right and for compliant and move on right and for better words you know regulations at better words you know regulations at better words you know regulations at least provide some minimum level of least provide some minimum level of least provide some minimum level of security right they give you minimum security right they give you minimum security right they give you minimum level of security that you know that level of security that you know that level of security that you know that these utilities these plants these these utilities these plants these these utilities these plants these companies have to follow and have to do companies have to follow and have to do companies have to follow and have to do is make sure they stay compliant. So is make sure they stay compliant. So is make sure they stay compliant. So leash noted there, but above is great, leash noted there, but above is great, leash noted there, but above is great, but still it's important to know that but still it's important to know that but still it's important to know that security and compliance, they don't security and compliance, they don't security and compliance, they don't necessarily of course go hand in hand. necessarily of course go hand in hand. necessarily of course go hand in hand. For compliance, you have to be what you For compliance, you have to be what you For compliance, you have to be what you say you're going to do. Your programs say you're going to do. Your programs say you're going to do. Your programs and process document. If you go above and process document. If you go above and process document. If you go above and beyond for cyber security, I applaud and beyond for cyber security, I applaud and beyond for cyber security, I applaud you. Great. Thank you. I'm super happy you. Great. Thank you. I'm super happy you. Great. Thank you. I'm super happy if my you know my powers very well if my you know my powers very well if my you know my powers very well secure because I like I mentioned secure because I like I mentioned secure because I like I mentioned before. I like my water. I'm gas. I like before. I like my water. I'm gas. I like before. I like my water. I'm gas. I like my water. So please be safe. Please my water. So please be safe. Please my water. So please be safe. Please invest a lot of cyber security. However, invest a lot of cyber security. However, invest a lot of cyber security. However, you know, make sure when you're doing you know, make sure when you're doing you know, make sure when you're doing it, you're doing it feasibly, right? it, you're doing it feasibly, right? it, you're doing it feasibly, right? There is a key balance here because if I There is a key balance here because if I There is a key balance here because if I go above and beyond the minimum level go above and beyond the minimum level go above and beyond the minimum level security requirements and then I say I'm security requirements and then I say I'm security requirements and then I say I'm going to do that by compliance program. going to do that by compliance program. going to do that by compliance program. Now, if I don't go above and beyond, I Now, if I don't go above and beyond, I Now, if I don't go above and beyond, I now not compliant. Maybe I'm secure now not compliant. Maybe I'm secure now not compliant. Maybe I'm secure still, but I'm now not compliant. Right? still, but I'm now not compliant. Right? still, but I'm now not compliant. Right? So, if you're doing the ML level, you're So, if you're doing the ML level, you're So, if you're doing the ML level, you're meeting compliance. You might not be meeting compliance. You might not be meeting compliance. You might not be secure fully, but you're compliant. If I secure fully, but you're compliant. If I secure fully, but you're compliant. If I go above and beyond, and even if I go go above and beyond, and even if I go go above and beyond, and even if I go past the minimum level of security, I I past the minimum level of security, I I past the minimum level of security, I I managed to do that, but I still have managed to do that, but I still have managed to do that, but I still have even a little bit more on top of that even a little bit more on top of that even a little bit more on top of that that I'm not able to do, even though I that I'm not able to do, even though I that I'm not able to do, even though I say I'm going to do it, I know I'm not say I'm going to do it, I know I'm not say I'm going to do it, I know I'm not compliant, even though I'm way above and compliant, even though I'm way above and compliant, even though I'm way above and beyond the standards, but because I beyond the standards, but because I beyond the standards, but because I didn't do what I said I was going to do, didn't do what I said I was going to do, didn't do what I said I was going to do, I'm not compliant. There's need a I'm not compliant. There's need a I'm not compliant. There's need a balance between again compliance and balance between again compliance and balance between again compliance and security and making sure we're doing it security and making sure we're doing it security and making sure we're doing it in a easy way something that's feasible in a easy way something that's feasible in a easy way something that's feasible and something that's secure something and something that's secure something and something that's secure something that's compliant. Now primarily some of that's compliant. Now primarily some of that's compliant. Now primarily some of the standards that we work on and some the standards that we work on and some the standards that we work on and some of the robust standards out there in the of the robust standards out there in the of the robust standards out there in the US the nerip standards. Now there are US the nerip standards. Now there are US the nerip standards. Now there are some standards um cover everything from some standards um cover everything from some standards um cover everything from asset and system asset and system asset and system parization controls your personel parization controls your personel parization controls your personel management and training your ESPs you management and training your ESPs you management and training your ESPs you know electron security perimeters your know electron security perimeters your know electron security perimeters your physical security perimeters your system physical security perimeters your system physical security perimeters your system security management instant reporting security management instant reporting security management instant reporting response and planning recovery plans response and planning recovery plans response and planning recovery plans configuration change management configuration change management configuration change management information protection communications information protection communications information protection communications supply chain risks and physical security supply chain risks and physical security supply chain risks and physical security and there's a lot there they cover many and there's a lot there they cover many and there's a lot there they cover many many different things but you know in many different things but you know in many different things but you know in these maybe it's great that they have these maybe it's great that they have these maybe it's great that they have they cover all this business standards they cover all this business standards they cover all this business standards but today primarily focusing on you know but today primarily focusing on you know but today primarily focusing on you know mitigation and and management we're mitigation and and management we're mitigation and and management we're going to be focusing on SIP now savings going to be focusing on SIP now savings going to be focusing on SIP now savings screen management and the five required screen management and the five required screen management and the five required and there's many sub requirements in and there's many sub requirements in and there's many sub requirements in these five requirements but the five these five requirements but the five these five requirements but the five requirements are mainly logical and requirements are mainly logical and requirements are mainly logical and digital port security patch management digital port security patch management digital port security patch management which is a big one as you will see by which is a big one as you will see by which is a big one as you will see by the red box here malicious code the red box here malicious code the red box here malicious code prevention security event monitoring prevention security event monitoring prevention security event monitoring system actual control all great things system actual control all great things system actual control all great things when looking at vulnerability management when looking at vulnerability management when looking at vulnerability management mitigation mitigation mitigation Now while there are other standards that Now while there are other standards that Now while there are other standards that are out there that have some to do with are out there that have some to do with are out there that have some to do with vulnerability engagement such as SIP 3, vulnerability engagement such as SIP 3, vulnerability engagement such as SIP 3, SIP 10 also have little pieces of SIP 10 also have little pieces of SIP 10 also have little pieces of learning enhancement in them. SIP 7 is learning enhancement in them. SIP 7 is learning enhancement in them. SIP 7 is just the standard most important of just the standard most important of just the standard most important of management especially from an ongoing management especially from an ongoing management especially from an ongoing perspective. perspective. perspective. Now the R2 here it's important to note Now the R2 here it's important to note Now the R2 here it's important to note that CI 67 itself specifically R2 is one that CI 67 itself specifically R2 is one that CI 67 itself specifically R2 is one of the most vile standards of nerip of the most vile standards of nerip of the most vile standards of nerip compliance which of course this standard compliance which of course this standard compliance which of course this standard specifically this requirement is the specifically this requirement is the specifically this requirement is the most common non-compliance that you find most common non-compliance that you find most common non-compliance that you find out in the industry. This is the most out in the industry. This is the most out in the industry. This is the most common reason here to find this is the common reason here to find this is the common reason here to find this is the most common places that are finding most common places that are finding most common places that are finding problems. This is sometimes your biggest problems. This is sometimes your biggest problems. This is sometimes your biggest biggest issue. It's vulnerability biggest issue. It's vulnerability biggest issue. It's vulnerability manager mitigation specifically SIP 7 manager mitigation specifically SIP 7 manager mitigation specifically SIP 7 and R2 and R2 and R2 patching. patching. patching. Now, and this is for a couple different Now, and this is for a couple different Now, and this is for a couple different reasons, right? When we're looking at reasons, right? When we're looking at reasons, right? When we're looking at security patch program, we're looking at security patch program, we're looking at security patch program, we're looking at discovery notification of available discovery notification of available discovery notification of available cyber security patch. That's your first cyber security patch. That's your first cyber security patch. That's your first step, right? You have to discover and or step, right? You have to discover and or step, right? You have to discover and or get notified of available cyber security get notified of available cyber security get notified of available cyber security patches to your assets. Once you do patches to your assets. Once you do patches to your assets. Once you do that, your calendar gets started. that, your calendar gets started. that, your calendar gets started. There's a timer you start. You now have There's a timer you start. You now have There's a timer you start. You now have seven eight days. Now with 70 days will seven eight days. Now with 70 days will seven eight days. Now with 70 days will be split into two different blocks. You be split into two different blocks. You be split into two different blocks. You have 35 color days to guided security have 35 color days to guided security have 35 color days to guided security patches for applicability. Making sure patches for applicability. Making sure patches for applicability. Making sure that those actually matter to you. that those actually matter to you. that those actually matter to you. Right? You might see the security patch Right? You might see the security patch Right? You might see the security patch need to go now review it evaluate it and need to go now review it evaluate it and need to go now review it evaluate it and make sure hey does this make sense? Does make sure hey does this make sense? Does make sure hey does this make sense? Does this apply to my assets? Do I need to this apply to my assets? Do I need to this apply to my assets? Do I need to actually apply to match? Then once actually apply to match? Then once actually apply to match? Then once that's done, you now have another 35 that's done, you now have another 35 that's done, you now have another 35 calendar days upon the valuation calendar days upon the valuation calendar days upon the valuation completion to now apply patch for a D completion to now apply patch for a D completion to now apply patch for a D mitigation plan or a buy an existing mitigation plan or a buy an existing mitigation plan or a buy an existing mitigation plan. Like I said, for many mitigation plan. Like I said, for many mitigation plan. Like I said, for many reasons, you know, this is the most reasons, you know, this is the most reasons, you know, this is the most violated standard, right? You realize violated standard, right? You realize violated standard, right? You realize that you're not hashing an asset because that you're not hashing an asset because that you're not hashing an asset because you missed it and it's in the asset you missed it and it's in the asset you missed it and it's in the asset management and inventory slide that management and inventory slide that management and inventory slide that we're talking about before. You miss an we're talking about before. You miss an we're talking about before. You miss an asset, you realize you're not ashing, asset, you realize you're not ashing, asset, you realize you're not ashing, right? Not a violation. Um, you have a right? Not a violation. Um, you have a right? Not a violation. Um, you have a calendar, right? that starts upon the calendar, right? that starts upon the calendar, right? that starts upon the discovery of a patch. Uh when you have discovery of a patch. Uh when you have discovery of a patch. Uh when you have vendors that are releasing daily patches vendors that are releasing daily patches vendors that are releasing daily patches on you, you don't want to look at those on you, you don't want to look at those on you, you don't want to look at those patches. It's like and if you don't want patches. It's like and if you don't want patches. It's like and if you don't want to look at an hour early, you want to be to look at an hour early, you want to be to look at an hour early, you want to be making sure you have good time windows making sure you have good time windows making sure you have good time windows and time management skills to make sure and time management skills to make sure and time management skills to make sure when you're looking at your patches, when you're looking at your patches, when you're looking at your patches, you're looking for those. You know when you're looking for those. You know when you're looking for those. You know when that calendar is going to start, you're that calendar is going to start, you're that calendar is going to start, you're ready for that sub window. And of ready for that sub window. And of ready for that sub window. And of course, keeping a subday window might course, keeping a subday window might course, keeping a subday window might sound, you know, easy, might sound hard. sound, you know, easy, might sound hard. sound, you know, easy, might sound hard. in any way, shape, or form. You know, of in any way, shape, or form. You know, of in any way, shape, or form. You know, of course, we all work, we all have course, we all work, we all have course, we all work, we all have priorities that we have to balance. We priorities that we have to balance. We priorities that we have to balance. We all have different things that we're all have different things that we're all have different things that we're talking at the same time and things, talking at the same time and things, talking at the same time and things, right? But when you have a 70-day time right? But when you have a 70-day time right? But when you have a 70-day time window compared to, you know, once a window compared to, you know, once a window compared to, you know, once a year time window or 15 time month time year time window or 15 time month time year time window or 15 time month time window, when your time window is 70 window, when your time window is 70 window, when your time window is 70 days, it's super easy when you days, it's super easy when you days, it's super easy when you accidentally miss something to all of a accidentally miss something to all of a accidentally miss something to all of a sudden be outside that calendar and sudden be outside that calendar and sudden be outside that calendar and realize you have a non compliance, realize you have a non compliance, realize you have a non compliance, realize you buy the realize you buy the realize you buy the container. And so you know the OT container. And so you know the OT container. And so you know the OT regulator for the landscape though regulator for the landscape though regulator for the landscape though there's much more out there right a lot there's much more out there right a lot there's much more out there right a lot of these problems I focused on today of these problems I focused on today of these problems I focused on today were from the nerf sip standards I were from the nerf sip standards I were from the nerf sip standards I wanted to focus on the nerip standards wanted to focus on the nerip standards wanted to focus on the nerip standards that's where I've seen most of these that's where I've seen most of these that's where I've seen most of these things out there um but of course it things out there um but of course it things out there um but of course it matters right there's the nerip matters right there's the nerip matters right there's the nerip standards there's the ner key standards standards there's the ner key standards standards there's the ner key standards which is also sell electricity water which is also sell electricity water which is also sell electricity water right now the current d2si standards the right now the current d2si standards the right now the current d2si standards the oil pipelines and railways also have the oil pipelines and railways also have the oil pipelines and railways also have the TSA security directives which are TSA security directives which are TSA security directives which are current regulations that are out there current regulations that are out there current regulations that are out there of course out in the future They're of course out in the future They're of course out in the future They're cutting out water and wastewater system cutting out water and wastewater system cutting out water and wastewater system sectors getting regulations to make sure sectors getting regulations to make sure sectors getting regulations to make sure there's some good section there. Of there's some good section there. Of there's some good section there. Of course, always there's always going to course, always there's always going to course, always there's always going to be changes. Regulations are always be changes. Regulations are always be changes. Regulations are always evolving. We're adapting the threats. evolving. We're adapting the threats. evolving. We're adapting the threats. They're moving up. They're moving They're moving up. They're moving They're moving up. They're moving forward. And it's important to know that forward. And it's important to know that forward. And it's important to know that when we're dealing with regulation, we when we're dealing with regulation, we when we're dealing with regulation, we cannot forget it is a security game, but cannot forget it is a security game, but cannot forget it is a security game, but it's also it's also it's also compliance. You have to make sure we're compliance. You have to make sure we're compliance. You have to make sure we're making things secure. You're patching making things secure. You're patching making things secure. You're patching vulnerabilities. you're doing mitigation vulnerabilities. you're doing mitigation vulnerabilities. you're doing mitigation like got to evidence. She have lots of like got to evidence. She have lots of like got to evidence. She have lots of other support work going on top of that. other support work going on top of that. other support work going on top of that. And so you need to, you know, you need And so you need to, you know, you need And so you need to, you know, you need to make sure that when you're doing this to make sure that when you're doing this to make sure that when you're doing this or if your industry is coming up for or if your industry is coming up for or if your industry is coming up for getting regulations, regulations are getting regulations, regulations are getting regulations, regulations are changing that you're staying on top of changing that you're staying on top of changing that you're staying on top of it, making sure you understand the it, making sure you understand the it, making sure you understand the security control that you do, the security control that you do, the security control that you do, the security crashes you're going to have to security crashes you're going to have to security crashes you're going to have to do as well as all the work that's going do as well as all the work that's going do as well as all the work that's going to take for evidence for all the other to take for evidence for all the other to take for evidence for all the other support tracks that are going to go into support tracks that are going to go into support tracks that are going to go into compliance regulation. You know once is compliance regulation. You know once is compliance regulation. You know once is enough that you know the future of enough that you know the future of enough that you know the future of regulation is written by today's regulation is written by today's regulation is written by today's vulnerabilities. It takes one incident vulnerabilities. It takes one incident vulnerabilities. It takes one incident to become regulated. Takes one outage to become regulated. Takes one outage to become regulated. Takes one outage one cyber attack. You know the 2003 one cyber attack. You know the 2003 one cyber attack. You know the 2003 black northeast blackout caused an earth black northeast blackout caused an earth black northeast blackout caused an earth ship standard today that have now been ship standard today that have now been ship standard today that have now been here for over 20 years is the future here for over 20 years is the future here for over 20 years is the future regulation is important. Okay. So now regulation is important. Okay. So now regulation is important. Okay. So now that even if you aren't regulated yet do that even if you aren't regulated yet do that even if you aren't regulated yet do need to pay attention. You do need to need to pay attention. You do need to need to pay attention. You do need to realize that it can become a colonial realize that it can become a colonial realize that it can become a colonial pipeline attack that was a few years ago pipeline attack that was a few years ago pipeline attack that was a few years ago caused a TSA 51 security standard. There caused a TSA 51 security standard. There caused a TSA 51 security standard. There have been talks but it took an outage. have been talks but it took an outage. have been talks but it took an outage. It took an incident to make it fully It took an incident to make it fully It took an incident to make it fully come into fruition. So even if your come into fruition. So even if your come into fruition. So even if your industry's bay isn't regulated, know industry's bay isn't regulated, know industry's bay isn't regulated, know that it can be on the horizon or if it that it can be on the horizon or if it that it can be on the horizon or if it is regulated know that one more is regulated know that one more is regulated know that one more incident, one more outage that can cause incident, one more outage that can cause incident, one more outage that can cause more regulations that can cause a change more regulations that can cause a change more regulations that can cause a change to regulations. Just understanding that to regulations. Just understanding that to regulations. Just understanding that this is an everchanging this is an everchanging this is an everchanging system and ever changing process is system and ever changing process is system and ever changing process is important. You have be ready for that important. You have be ready for that important. You have be ready for that and realize that if it comes you'll have and realize that if it comes you'll have and realize that if it comes you'll have access outside you have the availability access outside you have the availability access outside you have the availability right now. I'm going to hand this back right now. I'm going to hand this back right now. I'm going to hand this back over to talk a little bit more about the over to talk a little bit more about the over to talk a little bit more about the data needs when it comes to OT. Yeah. Um thanks. Thanks Alex. And I'll Yeah. Um thanks. Thanks Alex. And I'll Yeah. Um thanks. Thanks Alex. And I'll I'll make I'll I'll make one addition I'll make I'll I'll make one addition I'll make I'll I'll make one addition here for those of you in the room who here for those of you in the room who here for those of you in the room who are not in OT and who are in the the the are not in OT and who are in the the the are not in OT and who are in the the the IT realm. The the concern of regulation IT realm. The the concern of regulation IT realm. The the concern of regulation is just one more difficulty on on the is just one more difficulty on on the is just one more difficulty on on the the the tile uh the this is a map of a the the tile uh the this is a map of a the the tile uh the this is a map of a 2003 north 2003 north 2003 north northeast blackout where to simplify a northeast blackout where to simplify a northeast blackout where to simplify a very complex set of events. It was a hot very complex set of events. It was a hot very complex set of events. It was a hot day. Power lines uh sag material science day. Power lines uh sag material science day. Power lines uh sag material science sag in the heat, sagged, hit a tree, sag in the heat, sagged, hit a tree, sag in the heat, sagged, hit a tree, shortened, shorted out. Essentially, you shortened, shorted out. Essentially, you shortened, shorted out. Essentially, you have a power vacuum in the most literal have a power vacuum in the most literal have a power vacuum in the most literal sense of the term um that caused a sense of the term um that caused a sense of the term um that caused a cascading blackout across the northeast cascading blackout across the northeast cascading blackout across the northeast US while simultaneously a race condition US while simultaneously a race condition US while simultaneously a race condition in monitoring software meant that it was in monitoring software meant that it was in monitoring software meant that it was not noticed by the utility whose not noticed by the utility whose not noticed by the utility whose territory territory territory it occurred in that led through it occurred in that led through it occurred in that led through uh congressional edit uh congressional edit uh congressional edit uh mandate.

So, sorry it's early. Um, through a PP rush mandate to lead to the through a PP rush mandate to lead to the through a PP rush mandate to lead to the NERK nerk sit standards like Alex said NERK nerk sit standards like Alex said NERK nerk sit standards like Alex said an incident with ransomware and Colonial an incident with ransomware and Colonial an incident with ransomware and Colonial Colonial Pipeline where they shut down Colonial Pipeline where they shut down Colonial Pipeline where they shut down their OT operation because they could their OT operation because they could their OT operation because they could not fill uh led led to the the the TSTsa directives. And yes, it is that TSTsa directives. And yes, it is that TSTsa directives. And yes, it is that TSA is the one that stands when you go TSA is the one that stands when you go TSA is the one that stands when you go to the airport. to the airport. to the airport. So we're going to talk a little bit So we're going to talk a little bit So we're going to talk a little bit about the data the data needs about the data the data needs about the data the data needs here because they have different data here because they have different data here because they have different data different data needs in particular different data needs in particular different data needs in particular vulnerability metadata which we all know vulnerability metadata which we all know vulnerability metadata which we all know very well. This is not always helpful to very well. This is not always helpful to very well. This is not always helpful to practitioners. That is not me saying practitioners. That is not me saying practitioners. That is not me saying that we don't need it. It's still very that we don't need it. It's still very that we don't need it. It's still very important. But knowing that important. But knowing that important. But knowing that vulnerability is a buffer vulnerability is a buffer vulnerability is a buffer overflow does not really give you a lot overflow does not really give you a lot overflow does not really give you a lot of helpful information about what to do of helpful information about what to do of helpful information about what to do about it. Okay. Um again that's not me about it. Okay. Um again that's not me about it. Okay. Um again that's not me saying you can get rid of C.WE. Please saying you can get rid of C.WE. Please saying you can get rid of C.WE. Please do not go saying I I I I said that it's do not go saying I I I I said that it's do not go saying I I I I said that it's crucial for these secure by this design crucial for these secure by this design crucial for these secure by this design IT initiatives the right secure software IT initiatives the right secure software IT initiatives the right secure software to eliminate classes of vulnerabilities to eliminate classes of vulnerabilities to eliminate classes of vulnerabilities but it's not always helpful for a but it's not always helpful for a but it's not always helpful for a practitioner. it is it going to impact practitioner. it is it going to impact practitioner. it is it going to impact the approach to remediation? Likely the approach to remediation? Likely the approach to remediation? Likely not. Does it require cyber security not. Does it require cyber security not. Does it require cyber security knowledge? When we talk about nerk nerk knowledge? When we talk about nerk nerk knowledge? When we talk about nerk nerk ner sit there are a lot of power plants ner sit there are a lot of power plants ner sit there are a lot of power plants in this country that are staffed in this country that are staffed in this country that are staffed exclusively if not primarily by in exclusively if not primarily by in exclusively if not primarily by in engineers electrical engineers engineers electrical engineers engineers electrical engineers mechanical engineers because that's what mechanical engineers because that's what mechanical engineers because that's what she needs to run a plant. They may not she needs to run a plant. They may not she needs to run a plant. They may not have a dedicated cyber security team. have a dedicated cyber security team. have a dedicated cyber security team. When the SIP standards went into effect, When the SIP standards went into effect, When the SIP standards went into effect, you had a lot of engineering staff all you had a lot of engineering staff all you had a lot of engineering staff all of a sudden being handed the secondary of a sudden being handed the secondary of a sudden being handed the secondary job responsibility of cyber security in job responsibility of cyber security in job responsibility of cyber security in many cases without the necessary many cases without the necessary many cases without the necessary background or or or training in cyber background or or or training in cyber background or or or training in cyber security. That's not to say they're not security. That's not to say they're not security. That's not to say they're not very smart people. They do very very very smart people. They do very very very smart people. They do very very very well. But when you were you were very well. But when you were you were very well. But when you were you were learning about firewalls from scratch learning about firewalls from scratch learning about firewalls from scratch because your electrical engineering because your electrical engineering because your electrical engineering degree did not tell you what a firewall degree did not tell you what a firewall degree did not tell you what a firewall was particularly 40 years ago because was particularly 40 years ago because was particularly 40 years ago because career spans in this industry are quite career spans in this industry are quite career spans in this industry are quite long quite light like asset life long quite light like asset life long quite light like asset life spans that may not be information that spans that may not be information that spans that may not be information that you just have set hands and then data you just have set hands and then data you just have set hands and then data quality and I'm going to mention CPEs quality and I'm going to mention CPEs quality and I'm going to mention CPEs that's not can see. When we're talking that's not can see. When we're talking that's not can see. When we're talking about patching or remediation in about patching or remediation in about patching or remediation in particular, you have to be able to tell particular, you have to be able to tell particular, you have to be able to tell something is something is something is applicable. Especially in NOT, you have applicable. Especially in NOT, you have applicable. Especially in NOT, you have CPEs missing from vulnerabilities. You CPEs missing from vulnerabilities.

That is what we security ed advisories. That is what we security ed advisories. That is what we use most frequently to determine what is use most frequently to determine what is use most frequently to determine what is applicable to a a a system. Now a lot of applicable to a a a system. Now a lot of applicable to a a a system.

So vendor security advisories other. So vendor security advisories other. So vendor security advisories comp this this sheet avenue to get to comp this this sheet avenue to get to comp this this sheet avenue to get to information affected products and and information affected products and and information affected products and and versions will in most cases be complete versions will in most cases be complete versions will in most cases be complete in an advisory even if they are not in in an advisory even if they are not in in an advisory even if they are not in the associated C I'm so sorry CDE the associated C I'm so sorry CDE the associated C I'm so sorry CDE r r r a degree advisor will also um give you a degree advisor will also um give you a degree advisor will also um give you in insight into cases not to give it in insight into cases not to give it in insight into cases not to give it running a flashback. But things like W running a flashback. But things like W running a flashback. But things like W forJ when absolutely everything was a forJ when absolutely everything was a forJ when absolutely everything was a affected not every affected product had affected not every affected product had affected not every affected product had a CPE on that set of of uh loans. Many a CPE on that set of of uh loans. Many a CPE on that set of of uh loans. Many of the published security advisories of the published security advisories of the published security advisories detailing which of their products were detailing which of their products were detailing which of their products were affected. You'll get a CVE to patch affected. You'll get a CVE to patch affected.

You're taking a screenshot of that You're taking a screenshot of that You're taking a screenshot of that figure advisory because there are a figure advisory because there are a figure advisory because there are a couple of instances years ago of some couple of instances years ago of some couple of instances years ago of some vendors backdating advisories that then vendors backdating advisories that then vendors backdating advisories that then caused utilities to be out of clients caused utilities to be out of clients caused utilities to be out of clients because when they said we didn't find because when they said we didn't find because when they said we didn't find any patches and then the any patches and then the any patches and then the auditors came and said well vital blood auditors came and said well vital blood auditors came and said well vital blood on such and such's website it says that on such and such's website it says that on such and such's website it says that the day before you said you checked the day before you said you checked the day before you said you checked there was something published and you there was something published and you there was something published and you the if if you can't free why checked the if if you can't free why checked the if if you can't free why checked them on that day and there was nothing them on that day and there was nothing them on that day and there was nothing you're out of clock Uh so there's a lot you're out of clock Uh so there's a lot you're out of clock Uh so there's a lot of a lot of screenshots of a lot of screenshots of a lot of screenshots uh being used as compliance evidence and uh being used as compliance evidence and uh being used as compliance evidence and yet with all of this crucial information yet with all of this crucial information yet with all of this crucial information many of them aren't machine many of them aren't machine many of them aren't machine readable there's little if any access to readable there's little if any access to readable there's little if any access to a a feed um of published ur a a feed um of published ur a a feed um of published ur URLs and some are behind a login paid or URLs and some are behind a login paid or URLs and some are behind a login paid or or or or or dot Um, this is where you get a call or dot Um, this is where you get a call or dot Um, this is where you get a call to action, which is to action, which is to action, which is CESAP. CESAP. CESAP. Uh, this was the only name that made it Uh, this was the only name that made it Uh, this was the only name that made it into the presentation, but by golly, into the presentation, but by golly, into the presentation, but by golly, it's a good one. So, CESAP is the common it's a good one. So, CESAP is the common it's a good one. So, CESAP is the common standard advisory format. It's out of o standard advisory format. It's out of o standard advisory format. It's out of o Oasis, uh, primarily championed, at Oasis, uh, primarily championed, at Oasis, uh, primarily championed, at least at the moment, by PSI, the German least at the moment, by PSI, the German least at the moment, by PSI, the German Federal Cyber Security Agency. It's a Federal Cyber Security Agency. It's a Federal Cyber Security Agency. It's a JSON schema. Uh it's a structured JSON schema. Uh it's a structured JSON schema. Uh it's a structured language to create and update and share language to create and update and share language to create and update and share vendor signature advisories providing vendor signature advisories providing vendor signature advisories providing fields or all of these things that we fields or all of these things that we fields or all of these things that we get in a vendor advisory that we don't get in a vendor advisory that we don't get in a vendor advisory that we don't get in in the NB the NPD because the NBD get in in the NB the NPD because the NBD get in in the NB the NPD because the NBD is for is for is for vulnerabilities and advisories become a vulnerabilities and advisories become a vulnerabilities and advisories become a different beast. It's a machine readable different beast. It's a machine readable different beast. It's a machine readable course. Um, gives you the CBE to course. Um, gives you the CBE to course. Um, gives you the CBE to remediation mapping, whether that's a remediation mapping, whether that's a remediation mapping, whether that's a patch, whether that's a workound or a patch, whether that's a workound or a patch, whether that's a workound or a mitigation. And it allows for mitigation. And it allows for mitigation. And it allows for automation. In in OT, you can't scan automation. In in OT, you can't scan automation. In in OT, you can't scan things the way that that you will in it things the way that that you will in it things the way that that you will in it to determine what its vulnerabilities to determine what its vulnerabilities to determine what its vulnerabilities are. When you have devices that are so are. When you have devices that are so are. When you have devices that are so tailor made to a purpose that they send tailor made to a purpose that they send tailor made to a purpose that they send and expect network res requests and and expect network res requests and and expect network res requests and responses on a timer so that every responses on a timer so that every responses on a timer so that every second or every minute you're sending second or every minute you're sending second or every minute you're sending something to to the the central system something to to the the central system something to to the the central system and getting something back. You go run and getting something back. You go run and getting something back. You go run in that that device is going to say I in that that device is going to say I in that that device is going to say I have the RAM for this and it's going to have the RAM for this and it's going to have the RAM for this and it's going to shut down. That is not something you shut down. That is not something you shut down. That is not something you want to happen in your day-to-day want to happen in your day-to-day want to happen in your day-to-day operations. So you don't have the same operations. So you don't have the same operations. So you don't have the same ability to automatically go say let me ability to automatically go say let me ability to automatically go say let me go ping all of my systems and get go ping all of my systems and get go ping all of my systems and get information about what needs to be information about what needs to be information about what needs to be applied. Something in my CESAP allows applied. Something in my CESAP allows applied. Something in my CESAP allows for aation. Listen, I'm finishing grad for aation. Listen, I'm finishing grad for aation.

There is a section of my district, this is not a section of my district, this is not a section of my district, this is not a lie, that's about trying to identify and lie, that's about trying to identify and lie, that's about trying to identify and retrieve mitigation information from retrieve mitigation information from retrieve mitigation information from vendor security advisories. And I was at vendor security advisories. And I was at vendor security advisories. And I was at a conference three or four years ago and a conference three or four years ago and a conference three or four years ago and Yin Wisner from BSI presented on CESAP Yin Wisner from BSI presented on CESAP Yin Wisner from BSI presented on CESAP and I literally sat in the audience and and I literally sat in the audience and and I literally sat in the audience and went, "Well, that's useless." went, "Well, that's useless." went, "Well, that's useless." referring to my dissertation not CESAP referring to my dissertation not CESAP referring to my dissertation not CESAP because CESAP just made that section if because CESAP just made that section if because CESAP just made that section if not obsolete but certainly less not obsolete but certainly less not obsolete but certainly less necessary. necessary. necessary.

And one more thing I want to add to that And one more thing I want to add to that And one more thing I want to add to that there's one last piece of this a little there's one last piece of this a little there's one last piece of this a little bit which is things being too not being bit which is things being too not being bit which is things being too not being secure because they can interact with secure because they can interact with secure because they can interact with things that were too cold. Right? When things that were too cold. Right? When things that were too cold. Right? When I'm talking about the legacy systems you I'm talking about the legacy systems you I'm talking about the legacy systems you see, we're seeing things like Windows at see, we're seeing things like Windows at see, we're seeing things like Windows at T93, not many things are interact that T93, not many things are interact that T93, not many things are interact that system anymore, right? And if that's system anymore, right? And if that's system anymore, right? And if that's something that's critical and it's something that's critical and it's something that's critical and it's running alongside all these new running alongside all these new running alongside all these new technologies, you know, you might have technologies, you know, you might have technologies, you know, you might have vulnerabilities now, but you have to vulnerabilities now, but you have to vulnerabilities now, but you have to mitigate and change and these new mitigate and change and these new mitigate and change and these new technologies because the interface technologies because the interface technologies because the interface technology. So it's not only that technology. So it's not only that technology. So it's not only that they're too new, they're very miss that they're too new, they're very miss that they're too new, they're very miss that they're missing something that they need they're missing something that they need they're missing something that they need to be doing, but it's that they are new to be doing, but it's that they are new to be doing, but it's that they are new and a lot of the stuff you're working and a lot of the stuff you're working and a lot of the stuff you're working with is old and that introduces some new with is old and that introduces some new with is old and that introduces some new dependencies, some new things you have dependencies, some new things you have dependencies, some new things you have to worry about. Be mindful. All right, I've got a question from the All right, I've got a question from the All right, I've got a question from the explorer explorer explorer channel life cycle hide the hardware channel life cycle hide the hardware channel life cycle hide the hardware expensive industrial life cycle which is expensive industrial life cycle which is expensive industrial life cycle which is measured with decade. However, software measured with decade. However, software measured with decade. However, software technology OS platforms life cycle is technology OS platforms life cycle is technology OS platforms life cycle is relatively much shorter. How do you relatively much shorter. How do you relatively much shorter. How do you manage or expect OT which is greater manage or expect OT which is greater manage or expect OT which is greater than 10 years old having the security than 10 years old having the security than 10 years old having the security cat assuming in the first place you find cat assuming in the first place you find cat assuming in the first place you find that it has a vulnerability? Is there an that it has a vulnerability? Is there an that it has a vulnerability? Is there an alternative and practical solution to alternative and practical solution to alternative and practical solution to ensure RP mitigate it? Sorry. Um, so yes, there's mitigate it? Sorry. Um, so yes, there's mitigate it? Sorry. Um, so yes, there's going to be cases a lot of cases where going to be cases a lot of cases where going to be cases a lot of cases where there's not patch. I mean, there's not there's not patch. I mean, there's not there's not patch. I mean, there's not there's not anything. And there's there's not anything. And there's there's not anything. And there's there's there's there's two two avid use there's there's there's two two avid use there's there's there's two two avid use here. Uh, technically great. If you have here. Uh, technically great. If you have here. Uh, technically great. If you have a mitigation from the vendor for a a mitigation from the vendor for a a mitigation from the vendor for a vulnerability, great. Easy. Maybe that's vulnerability, great. Easy. Maybe that's vulnerability, great. Easy. Maybe that's turning off VLAN on a switch when you're turning off VLAN on a switch when you're turning off VLAN on a switch when you're not using VLAN. Easy. Uh, it might say not using VLAN. Easy. Uh, it might say not using VLAN. Easy. Uh, it might say you'll mitigate this if you turn off you'll mitigate this if you turn off you'll mitigate this if you turn off VLAN, but you're using VLAN. Oh, no. VLAN, but you're using VLAN. Oh, no. VLAN, but you're using VLAN. Oh, no. What you now? Uh the answer is you have What you now? Uh the answer is you have What you now? Uh the answer is you have to look at security from a higher higher to look at security from a higher higher to look at security from a higher higher view. There comes a point where we've view. There comes a point where we've view. There comes a point where we've got to have proper got to have proper got to have proper segmentation there. There comes a point segmentation there. There comes a point segmentation there. There comes a point where that is that is the only where that is that is the only where that is that is the only recommenation that I could reasonably recommenation that I could reasonably recommenation that I could reasonably give to you to start to mitigate some of give to you to start to mitigate some of give to you to start to mitigate some of these things. I'm not talking about air these things. I'm not talking about air these things. I'm not talking about air gaps for it and get into air gaps. But gaps for it and get into air gaps. But gaps for it and get into air gaps. But talking about properly segmentation, talking about properly segmentation, talking about properly segmentation, restricting access, there's a level of restricting access, there's a level of restricting access, there's a level of risk that especially with these these risk that especially with these these risk that especially with these these older systems, you may have to accept older systems, you may have to accept older systems, you may have to accept and your goal is to limit that risk as and your goal is to limit that risk as and your goal is to limit that risk as much as possible. And a lot of times much as possible. And a lot of times much as possible. And a lot of times that's going to say that's going to be that's going to say that's going to be that's going to say that's going to be without a fatal without a fatal without a fatal report. I I'll keep that real quick with report. I I'll keep that real quick with report. I I'll keep that real quick with a funnel and a special area. Yeah, I'm a funnel and a special area. Yeah, I'm a funnel and a special area. Yeah, I'm there. Uh um you know, it it truly is it there. Uh um you know, it it truly is it there. Uh um you know, it it truly is it comes down to other media controls, comes down to other media controls, comes down to other media controls, right? Hey, when you're deal with a right? Hey, when you're deal with a right? Hey, when you're deal with a different CN hardware and software different CN hardware and software different CN hardware and software timelines, if your software timeline is timelines, if your software timeline is timelines, if your software timeline is much dust than your timeline, you know, much dust than your timeline, you know, much dust than your timeline, you know, you really truly might not be able to you really truly might not be able to you really truly might not be able to apply the patch, you might not be able apply the patch, you might not be able apply the patch, you might not be able to do the same controls. And so other to do the same controls. And so other to do the same controls. And so other ming controls besides patching is key ming controls besides patching is key ming controls besides patching is key out. Um, for example, um, there's a out. Um, for example, um, there's a out. Um, for example, um, there's a plant that hit Ben 2 that on their air plant that hit Ben 2 that on their air plant that hit Ben 2 that on their air gap or I say air gap location, you know gap or I say air gap location, you know gap or I say air gap location, you know that network it says their air gap that network it says their air gap that network it says their air gap network is their bouncing plant network. network is their bouncing plant network. network is their bouncing plant network. He was running operations he was running He was running operations he was running He was running operations he was running a Windows XT right and but he has no no a Windows XT right and but he has no no a Windows XT right and but he has no no connection to the outside right I say connection to the outside right I say connection to the outside right I say air cap quotations because it does maybe air cap quotations because it does maybe air cap quotations because it does maybe not a connection to the outside but not a connection to the outside but not a connection to the outside but maybe on his commission maybe when you maybe on his commission maybe when you maybe on his commission maybe when you build the system in the outside maybe build the system in the outside maybe build the system in the outside maybe when a vendor walked in with our laptop when a vendor walked in with our laptop when a vendor walked in with our laptop to do maintenance there was something to do maintenance there was something to do maintenance there was something there where USB right we were doing work there where USB right we were doing work there where USB right we were doing work on this facility and we actually found a on this facility and we actually found a on this facility and we actually found a worm inside the air worm inside the air worm inside the air network and we looked at worm we did a network and we looked at worm we did a network and we looked at worm we did a little bit of forensics we found out little bit of forensics we found out little bit of forensics we found out that worked through the system for at that worked through the system for at that worked through the system for at least 12 years at least that's when the least 12 years at least that's when the least 12 years at least that's when the backup stopped and I couldn't tell if it backup stopped and I couldn't tell if it backup stopped and I couldn't tell if it weren't still in the system anymore weren't still in the system anymore weren't still in the system anymore because I couldn't see any part of back because I couldn't see any part of back because I couldn't see any part of back in 12 years right um and so it's in 12 years right um and so it's in 12 years right um and so it's important that that they had this day of important that that they had this day of important that that they had this day of software hardware problem now of how do software hardware problem now of how do software hardware problem now of how do we deal with this work on a system we deal with this work on a system we deal with this work on a system that's running Windows XP that can't that's running Windows XP that can't that's running Windows XP that can't connect anywhere what could we do they connect anywhere what could we do they connect anywhere what could we do they then had to try and find who are working then had to try and find who are working then had to try and find who are working with companies trying to say hey can you with companies trying to say hey can you with companies trying to say hey can you guys give us a uh you know a product guys give us a uh you know a product guys give us a uh you know a product that can you know a vulnerability you that can you know a vulnerability you that can you know a vulnerability you know a vulnerability scanner or know a vulnerability scanner or know a vulnerability scanner or something that we can try to get into something that we can try to get into something that we can try to get into this area network that runs on Windows this area network that runs on Windows this area network that runs on Windows XP anymore. They kind of a lot of a lot XP anymore. They kind of a lot of a lot XP anymore. They kind of a lot of a lot of vendors don't do Windows XP anymore of vendors don't do Windows XP anymore of vendors don't do Windows XP anymore and they had a big problem and so they and they had a big problem and so they and they had a big problem and so they bought and bought and bought and had bought and bought and bought and had bought and bought and bought and had this big distance between the software this big distance between the software this big distance between the software of today and the hardware of yesterday of today and the hardware of yesterday of today and the hardware of yesterday right and so that is a big problem. Hi, I have a question from research Hi, I have a question from research Hi, I have a question from research perspective. Uh how would you recommend perspective. Uh how would you recommend perspective. Uh how would you recommend someone to simulate a paper effort like someone to simulate a paper effort like someone to simulate a paper effort like is it is it advisable to have like a is it is it advisable to have like a is it is it advisable to have like a software emulation or would you would software emulation or would you would software emulation or would you would you recommend having a physical lab you recommend having a physical lab you recommend having a physical lab systems or like what's the power let's systems or like what's the power let's systems or like what's the power let's say someone has a simulation and what's say someone has a simulation and what's say someone has a simulation and what's the key someone that's one say yeah and so I would say I would say both yeah and so I would say I would say both yeah and so I would say I would say both depending depending on your resources. depending depending on your resources. depending depending on your resources. If it is if a a a a software a virtual If it is if a a a a software a virtual If it is if a a a a software a virtual system is what's feasible, then that's system is what's feasible, then that's system is what's feasible, then that's that's what's what's feasible. that's what's what's feasible. that's what's what's feasible. Then I love playing around with Then I love playing around with Then I love playing around with hardware. So, I'm going to say it's hard hardware. So, I'm going to say it's hard hardware. So, I'm going to say it's hard to have a little lab. Um it it is also to have a little lab. Um it it is also to have a little lab. Um it it is also good. There are things that can come up good. There are things that can come up good. There are things that can come up with these environments that aren't with these environments that aren't with these environments that aren't properly properly properly uh or aren't well simulated in in a uh or aren't well simulated in in a uh or aren't well simulated in in a virtual environment. if you want to send virtual environment. if you want to send virtual environment. if you want to send me an email or come chat after I get you me an email or come chat after I get you me an email or come chat after I get you some more examples. some more examples. some more examples. thumbs. Thank you. Perfect. And I'll thumbs. Thank you. Perfect. And I'll thumbs. Thank you. Perfect. And I'll provide you I'll provide the scenario provide you I'll provide the scenario provide you I'll provide the scenario when you're talking about the difference when you're talking about the difference when you're talking about the difference data data data scient and testing networks and testing scient and testing networks and testing scient and testing networks and testing beds for a lot of these different beds for a lot of these different beds for a lot of these different vulnerabilities research you know in the vulnerabilities research you know in the vulnerabilities research you know in the IT world right using development IT world right using development IT world right using development networks using testing networks before networks using testing networks before networks using testing networks before you do this that's critical it's you do this that's critical it's you do this that's critical it's important and sometimes it might be important and sometimes it might be important and sometimes it might be easier than the IT world right but we're easier than the IT world right but we're easier than the IT world right but we're working with thousands of devices like I working with thousands of devices like I working with thousands of devices like I said but there are thousands of devices said but there are thousands of devices said but there are thousands of devices but maybe they're actually truly five or but maybe they're actually truly five or but maybe they're actually truly five or six different devices right it be pretty six different devices right it be pretty six different devices right it be pretty easy to build a test network or a test easy to build a test network or a test easy to build a test network or a test net you know to go through those for one net you know to go through those for one net you know to go through those for one of the for research purposes because you of the for research purposes because you of the for research purposes because you know all we do in six different devices know all we do in six different devices know all we do in six different devices right but in the OT world you know right but in the OT world you know right but in the OT world you know developed networks are there and testing developed networks are there and testing developed networks are there and testing networks are there and and some days networks are there and and some days networks are there and and some days require but those networks tend to be a require but those networks tend to be a require but those networks tend to be a little bit different right because we're little bit different right because we're little bit different right because we're dealing with 250 assets that maybe let's dealing with 250 assets that maybe let's dealing with 250 assets that maybe let's say you know there's a 100 unique assets say you know there's a 100 unique assets say you know there's a 100 unique assets over 250 right they're all different over 250 right they're all different over 250 right they're all different oses they're all interconnected a oses they're all interconnected a oses they're all interconnected a different way a lot of those assets different way a lot of those assets different way a lot of those assets probably don't even have network probably don't even have network probably don't even have network connectivity So a test bed network might connectivity So a test bed network might connectivity So a test bed network might not necessarily help unless you're not necessarily help unless you're not necessarily help unless you're making sure that you're making sure making sure that you're making sure making sure that you're making sure you're doing IP plus serial plus all you're doing IP plus serial plus all you're doing IP plus serial plus all these other connections and at the same these other connections and at the same these other connections and at the same time you know it can be hard to make time you know it can be hard to make time you know it can be hard to make sure you have a test conductor. Like I sure you have a test conductor. Like I sure you have a test conductor. Like I said I've been facilities with Windows said I've been facilities with Windows said I've been facilities with Windows NT93. You don't find those computers NT93. You don't find those computers NT93. You don't find those computers anymore. You want to go buy another anymore. You want to go buy another anymore. You want to go buy another computer put in your test guide network computer put in your test guide network computer put in your test guide network Windows NT93. Good luck. Um have fun Windows NT93. Good luck. Um have fun Windows NT93. Good luck. Um have fun trying to find one that still runs on a trying to find one that still runs on a trying to find one that still runs on a floppy disc drive. I'm going to tell you floppy disc drive. I'm going to tell you floppy disc drive. I'm going to tell you it's a it's a big surprise when I went it's a it's a big surprise when I went it's a it's a big surprise when I went under uh under the desk there to try to under uh under the desk there to try to under uh under the desk there to try to find the computer and not recognizing find the computer and not recognizing find the computer and not recognizing the the Windows system and then trying the the Windows system and then trying the the Windows system and then trying to go put a USB into a floppy disc drive to go put a USB into a floppy disc drive to go put a USB into a floppy disc drive when I open it when I went down there I when I open it when I went down there I when I open it when I went down there I was like oh yeah that's not well so the was like oh yeah that's not well so the was like oh yeah that's not well so the problem is you know test networks are problem is you know test networks are problem is you know test networks are good development networks are good and good development networks are good and good development networks are good and I'm a proponent for it great you know I'm a proponent for it great you know I'm a proponent for it great you know please use that and try your best but in please use that and try your best but in please use that and try your best but in the LT world a lot of times those test the LT world a lot of times those test the LT world a lot of times those test networks they fall short and truly only networks they fall short and truly only networks they fall short and truly only have most critical assets or even if have most critical assets or even if have most critical assets or even if they're the most critical they'll have, they're the most critical they'll have, they're the most critical they'll have, you know, as many critical or born you know, as many critical or born you know, as many critical or born assets as they can that can actually assets as they can that can actually assets as they can that can actually work in those test environments because work in those test environments because work in those test environments because like I said it is sometimes you just like I said it is sometimes you just like I said it is sometimes you just can't build a fully capable test network can't build a fully capable test network can't build a fully capable test network environment because of the difficulties environment because of the difficulties environment because of the difficulties with OT technology. I um I have a small mark regarding I um I have a small mark regarding I um I have a small mark regarding vendors and and customer relations. Uh vendors and and customer relations. Uh vendors and and customer relations. Uh so when I talk to uh to OG Fox they can so when I talk to uh to OG Fox they can so when I talk to uh to OG Fox they can say yeah we we're just one company and say yeah we we're just one company and say yeah we we're just one company and we're just such a small but don't make a we're just such a small but don't make a we're just such a small but don't make a power operation since they unmy power power operation since they unmy power power operation since they unmy power plants are plants are plants are huge in that but for big wider huge in that but for big wider huge in that but for big wider they how many winners are there because they how many winners are there because they how many winners are there because with have that much range of uh your AR with have that much range of uh your AR with have that much range of uh your AR would of the one range that your R but would of the one range that your R but would of the one range that your R but als means uh you have much more power als means uh you have much more power als means uh you have much more power once you're in the stage that we so once you're in the stage that we so once you're in the stage that we so don't underestimate that uh ESI release don't underestimate that uh ESI release don't underestimate that uh ESI release uh a technical guard line and can act uh a technical guard line and can act uh a technical guard line and can act like in one sent um Ver has to comply with and there's um Ver has to comply with and there's um Ver has to comply with and there's lines um with is a guideline there by lines um with is a guideline there by lines um with is a guideline there by security one and that basically says the security one and that basically says the security one and that basically says the thing provide security advisories and thing provide security advisories and thing provide security advisories and app um make them access or control on place that we have the or control on place that we have the or control on place that we have the data that we need as graders to actually data that we need as graders to actually data that we need as graders to actually on that and pretty lines wherever on that and pretty lines wherever on that and pretty lines wherever we actual talk to you and yes 100% said we actual talk to you and yes 100% said we actual talk to you and yes 100% said thank you 100% for your comment and then thank you 100% for your comment and then thank you 100% for your comment and then wholeheart agree remember you know it's wholeheart agree remember you know it's wholeheart agree remember you know it's it's important you know GE for example it's important you know GE for example it's important you know GE for example not tech G I love you know badly out not tech G I love you know badly out not tech G I love you know badly out list G um for example you know there's list G um for example you know there's list G um for example you know there's you know you might be a part company you you know you might be a part company you you know you might be a part company you say I you know I I don't think she's say I you know I I don't think she's say I you know I I don't think she's gonna listen if I tell them I want gonna listen if I tell them I want gonna listen if I tell them I want something they're not going to listen to something they're not going to listen to something they're not going to listen to me you know they have these surveys so me you know they have these surveys so me you know they have these surveys so many other companies worldwide many other companies worldwide many other companies worldwide industries wide you know they do they do industries wide you know they do they do industries wide you know they do they do so much do remember you have power you so much do remember you have power you so much do remember you have power you have important, right?
