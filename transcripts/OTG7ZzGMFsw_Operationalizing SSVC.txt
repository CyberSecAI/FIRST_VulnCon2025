But we couldn't do anything that we do without our do anything that we do without our do anything that we do without our partnerships across the organization and partnerships across the organization and partnerships across the organization and out in the world. So, I will turn it out in the world. So, I will turn it out in the world. So, I will turn it over to my colleague Sean Latona to over to my colleague Sean Latona to over to my colleague Sean Latona to introduce himself as well. introduce himself as well. introduce himself as well. Thank you, Lindsay. And uh thank you Thank you, Lindsay. And uh thank you Thank you, Lindsay. And uh thank you everybody for giving me this opportunity everybody for giving me this opportunity everybody for giving me this opportunity to come talk to you all again as Lindsay to come talk to you all again as Lindsay to come talk to you all again as Lindsay had mentioned. Uh really sorry that we had mentioned. Uh really sorry that we had mentioned. Uh really sorry that we couldn't travel down there, but happy to couldn't travel down there, but happy to couldn't travel down there, but happy to be able to present to you uh be able to present to you uh be able to present to you uh nonetheless. So uh my name is Sean nonetheless. So uh my name is Sean nonetheless. So uh my name is Sean Latona and I'm the chief of operations Latona and I'm the chief of operations Latona and I'm the chief of operations for vulnerability management. And really for vulnerability management. And really for vulnerability management. And really what that means is I take all of the what that means is I take all of the what that means is I take all of the great work that Lindsay and her team are great work that Lindsay and her team are great work that Lindsay and her team are doing as well as all the great work that doing as well as all the great work that doing as well as all the great work that the other branches within vulnerability the other branches within vulnerability the other branches within vulnerability management are doing, coordinate them management are doing, coordinate them management are doing, coordinate them across the cyber security division across the cyber security division across the cyber security division within SIZA all the way across SIZA and within SIZA all the way across SIZA and within SIZA all the way across SIZA and then out into our various stakeholders then out into our various stakeholders then out into our various stakeholders uh which include the federal government uh which include the federal government uh which include the federal government and critical infrastructure. and critical infrastructure. and critical infrastructure. So if we can just jump over right to the So if we can just jump over right to the So if we can just jump over right to the next slide, I'll talk very briefly about next slide, I'll talk very briefly about next slide, I'll talk very briefly about who VM is, who vulnerability management who VM is, who vulnerability management who VM is, who vulnerability management is, what we do at large and then talk is, what we do at large and then talk is, what we do at large and then talk about our stakeholders. So uh as you can about our stakeholders. So uh as you can about our stakeholders. So uh as you can see, VM's mission is uh not like a see, VM's mission is uh not like a see, VM's mission is uh not like a traditional vulnerability management traditional vulnerability management traditional vulnerability management mission in an enterprise organization, mission in an enterprise organization, mission in an enterprise organization, right? We have a little bit of a a right? We have a little bit of a a right? We have a little bit of a a unique responsibility. So our job in VM unique responsibility. So our job in VM unique responsibility. So our job in VM uh within SIZA is to reduce the uh within SIZA is to reduce the uh within SIZA is to reduce the prevalence and impact of vulnerabilities prevalence and impact of vulnerabilities prevalence and impact of vulnerabilities and exploitable conditions across and exploitable conditions across and exploitable conditions across enterprise and technologies through enterprise and technologies through enterprise and technologies through assessments and coordinating disclosure assessments and coordinating disclosure assessments and coordinating disclosure of vulnerabilities reported by trusted of vulnerabilities reported by trusted of vulnerabilities reported by trusted partners. Right? So that means that our partners. Right? So that means that our partners. Right? So that means that our job is very much left of an incident but job is very much left of an incident but job is very much left of an incident but across a broad spectrum of stakeholders. across a broad spectrum of stakeholders. across a broad spectrum of stakeholders. Uh our stakeholders include the the Uh our stakeholders include the the Uh our stakeholders include the the federal civilian executive branch. federal civilian executive branch. federal civilian executive branch. You'll hear us refer to that as the FEB. You'll hear us refer to that as the FEB. You'll hear us refer to that as the FEB. Uh multiple agencies within the state, Uh multiple agencies within the state, Uh multiple agencies within the state, local, tribal, and territorial community local, tribal, and territorial community local, tribal, and territorial community as well as critical as well as critical as well as critical infrastructure sectors all the way infrastructure sectors all the way infrastructure sectors all the way across the country. Uh and we really try across the country. Uh and we really try across the country. Uh and we really try to feed into those high level national to feed into those high level national to feed into those high level national security objectives uh from the cyber security objectives uh from the cyber security objectives uh from the cyber perspective. Lindsay and I are focused perspective. Lindsay and I are focused perspective. Lindsay and I are focused again like I said on this within the again like I said on this within the again like I said on this within the cyber security division. So our cyber security division. So our cyber security division. So our particular mission space does have a particular mission space does have a particular mission space does have a cyber nexus which is uh super duper cyber nexus which is uh super duper cyber nexus which is uh super duper important as I'm sure we're all aware. important as I'm sure we're all aware. important as I'm sure we're all aware. So what are some of the things that we So what are some of the things that we So what are some of the things that we bring to the table within VM? So as bring to the table within VM? So as bring to the table within VM? So as Lindsay had mentioned, not only do we Lindsay had mentioned, not only do we Lindsay had mentioned, not only do we have the known exploited vulnerabilities have the known exploited vulnerabilities have the known exploited vulnerabilities catalog uh and the coordinated catalog uh and the coordinated catalog uh and the coordinated vulnerability disclosure platforms and vulnerability disclosure platforms and vulnerability disclosure platforms and processes, we also have our automated processes, we also have our automated processes, we also have our automated scanning capabilities. We have the scanning capabilities. We have the scanning capabilities. We have the pentesters, we have the red teamers and pentesters, we have the red teamers and pentesters, we have the red teamers and then we have our security at scale group then we have our security at scale group then we have our security at scale group which is really trying to drive scalable which is really trying to drive scalable which is really trying to drive scalable security measures across the entire security measures across the entire security measures across the entire ecosystem. So some of the tools that we ecosystem. So some of the tools that we ecosystem. So some of the tools that we leverage in addition to having technical leverage in addition to having technical leverage in addition to having technical smears and hands-on experts uh we feed smears and hands-on experts uh we feed smears and hands-on experts uh we feed into some of the other the messaging into some of the other the messaging into some of the other the messaging that you may see coming from SIZA right that you may see coming from SIZA right that you may see coming from SIZA right so we support the develop on the federal so we support the develop on the federal so we support the develop on the federal government side of the house we support government side of the house we support government side of the house we support the development of our binding the development of our binding the development of our binding operational directives um we support operational directives um we support operational directives um we support bringing the kev catalog to the table bringing the kev catalog to the table bringing the kev catalog to the table right and if if you weren't aware the right and if if you weren't aware the right and if if you weren't aware the kev catalog that Lindsay and her team kev catalog that Lindsay and her team kev catalog that Lindsay and her team manage is actually supported and manage is actually supported and manage is actually supported and enforced throughout the federal enforced throughout the federal enforced throughout the federal government by a binding operational government by a binding operational government by a binding operational directive that mandates organizations or directive that mandates organizations or directive that mandates organizations or federal agencies take specific action federal agencies take specific action federal agencies take specific action within a certain reasonable time frame. within a certain reasonable time frame. within a certain reasonable time frame. We also host a weekly sock call where we We also host a weekly sock call where we We also host a weekly sock call where we brief out emerging priorities and upand brief out emerging priorities and upand brief out emerging priorities and upand cominging vulnerabilities that have our cominging vulnerabilities that have our cominging vulnerabilities that have our attention uh to a broad audience of attention uh to a broad audience of attention uh to a broad audience of about six or 700 um fab members about six or 700 um fab members about six or 700 um fab members sizes across the board. On the SLT and sizes across the board. On the SLT and sizes across the board. On the SLT and critical infrastructure side of the critical infrastructure side of the critical infrastructure side of the house, we really help to drive messaging house, we really help to drive messaging house, we really help to drive messaging uh not only through alerts and cyber uh not only through alerts and cyber uh not only through alerts and cyber security advisories, but through security advisories, but through security advisories, but through targeted notifications, very specific targeted notifications, very specific targeted notifications, very specific guidance. You may have seen some of our guidance. You may have seen some of our guidance. You may have seen some of our mitigation guidance or our hunt guides mitigation guidance or our hunt guides mitigation guidance or our hunt guides go out. Uh VM plays an important role in go out. Uh VM plays an important role in go out. Uh VM plays an important role in ensuring that all those technical ensuring that all those technical ensuring that all those technical details are outlined and described details are outlined and described details are outlined and described accordingly. And then working with accordingly. And then working with accordingly. And then working with Lindsay's team, uh, one of the core Lindsay's team, uh, one of the core Lindsay's team, uh, one of the core questions that we seek to answer and questions that we seek to answer and questions that we seek to answer and that we're really driving to with this that we're really driving to with this that we're really driving to with this particular presentation is how do we particular presentation is how do we particular presentation is how do we prioritize, how do we rack and stack all prioritize, how do we rack and stack all prioritize, how do we rack and stack all of these vulnerabilities that we're of these vulnerabilities that we're of these vulnerabilities that we're doing our very best to monitor, bring to doing our very best to monitor, bring to doing our very best to monitor, bring to the table, and offer, you know, uh, good the table, and offer, you know, uh, good the table, and offer, you know, uh, good guidance, actionable guidance, um, in a guidance, actionable guidance, um, in a guidance, actionable guidance, um, in a responsible manner. So, if we're looking responsible manner. So, if we're looking responsible manner. So, if we're looking at 40,000 vulnerabilities that are at 40,000 vulnerabilities that are at 40,000 vulnerabilities that are disclosed every year, how do we do that? disclosed every year, how do we do that? disclosed every year, how do we do that? How do we bring all of that together and How do we bring all of that together and How do we bring all of that together and make sure that we are really paying make sure that we are really paying make sure that we are really paying attention to those that matter and those attention to those that matter and those attention to those that matter and those that are going to have the biggest that are going to have the biggest that are going to have the biggest impact? And to give you that answer, I'm impact? And to give you that answer, I'm impact? And to give you that answer, I'm going to go ahead and turn it right back going to go ahead and turn it right back going to go ahead and turn it right back over to Lindsay to let you walk through over to Lindsay to let you walk through over to Lindsay to let you walk through the rest of this. All right. Hey, um, surprise. It's All right. Hey, um, surprise. It's All right. Hey, um, surprise. It's SSBC. That's why you're here. So, that's SSBC. That's why you're here. So, that's SSBC. That's why you're here. So, that's what we're gonna talk about. Um, so I'm what we're gonna talk about. Um, so I'm what we're gonna talk about. Um, so I'm the name of this slide is SSVC in 60 the name of this slide is SSVC in 60 the name of this slide is SSVC in 60 seconds. Sean's going to call me a liar seconds. Sean's going to call me a liar seconds. Sean's going to call me a liar because our outline says that I'm going because our outline says that I'm going because our outline says that I'm going to take three minutes on this slide. So to take three minutes on this slide. So to take three minutes on this slide. So it's not really 60 seconds, but that it's not really 60 seconds, but that it's not really 60 seconds, but that looks better than three minutes. Um, so looks better than three minutes. Um, so looks better than three minutes. Um, so I think we would be it would be remiss I think we would be it would be remiss I think we would be it would be remiss of me to talk about SSVC and not talk of me to talk about SSVC and not talk of me to talk about SSVC and not talk about CVSS in part because for many about CVSS in part because for many about CVSS in part because for many years CVSS was sort of the only option years CVSS was sort of the only option years CVSS was sort of the only option to use for any uh technical to use for any uh technical to use for any uh technical understanding or understanding or understanding or prioritization. And I hope I'm not prioritization. And I hope I'm not prioritization. And I hope I'm not saying anything controversial by stating saying anything controversial by stating saying anything controversial by stating for those of you in the room that CVSS for those of you in the room that CVSS for those of you in the room that CVSS is extremely useful for understanding is extremely useful for understanding is extremely useful for understanding the technical facets of a vulnerability. the technical facets of a vulnerability. the technical facets of a vulnerability. that vector string uh in many cases that vector string uh in many cases that vector string uh in many cases gives gives us some of the best gives gives us some of the best gives gives us some of the best information that we can get to information that we can get to information that we can get to understand the potential like worst case understand the potential like worst case understand the potential like worst case scenario technical impact of a scenario technical impact of a scenario technical impact of a vulnerability um somewhat in a vacuum. vulnerability um somewhat in a vacuum. vulnerability um somewhat in a vacuum. But there are limitations when But there are limitations when But there are limitations when considering that vulnerability and that considering that vulnerability and that considering that vulnerability and that CBSS score and vector string for CBSS score and vector string for CBSS score and vector string for potential impact on a sort of wider um potential impact on a sort of wider um potential impact on a sort of wider um set of unique stakeholders with their set of unique stakeholders with their set of unique stakeholders with their own environmental um concerns. own environmental um concerns. own environmental um concerns. So we recognize that um you know just to So we recognize that um you know just to So we recognize that um you know just to give you an example for our stakeholder give you an example for our stakeholder give you an example for our stakeholder set that Sean talked about in the set that Sean talked about in the set that Sean talked about in the previous slide. We recognize that the previous slide. We recognize that the previous slide. We recognize that the vulnerabilities that pose the biggest vulnerabilities that pose the biggest vulnerabilities that pose the biggest threat threat to those federal SLT and threat threat to those federal SLT and threat threat to those federal SLT and critical infrastructure environments are critical infrastructure environments are critical infrastructure environments are actually those that are already being actually those that are already being actually those that are already being exploited in the wild. Um, so how do we exploited in the wild. Um, so how do we exploited in the wild. Um, so how do we take that state of exploitation and that take that state of exploitation and that take that state of exploitation and that stakeholders concerns at scale into stakeholders concerns at scale into stakeholders concerns at scale into consideration at scale in sort of a consideration at scale in sort of a consideration at scale in sort of a repeatable process? So several years ago repeatable process? So several years ago repeatable process? So several years ago in response to this perceived gap and in response to this perceived gap and in response to this perceived gap and need uh SEI or the software engineering need uh SEI or the software engineering need uh SEI or the software engineering institute and SISA developed the institute and SISA developed the institute and SISA developed the stakeholder specific vulnerability stakeholder specific vulnerability stakeholder specific vulnerability categorization or SSVC model for categorization or SSVC model for categorization or SSVC model for prioritizing vulnerabilities in an prioritizing vulnerabilities in an prioritizing vulnerabilities in an organization. Um, this is a decision organization. Um, this is a decision organization. Um, this is a decision tree model that enables an organization tree model that enables an organization tree model that enables an organization to walk through a repeated to walk through a repeated to walk through a repeated decision-making process. Um, it's it's decision-making process. Um, it's it's decision-making process. Um, it's it's very repeatable. It can be consistent very repeatable. It can be consistent very repeatable. It can be consistent across well-trained analysts. Um, and it across well-trained analysts. Um, and it across well-trained analysts. Um, and it really gives you that triage framework really gives you that triage framework really gives you that triage framework to determine, okay, I've got 40,000 to determine, okay, I've got 40,000 to determine, okay, I've got 40,000 vulnerabilities. I've got just as many, vulnerabilities. I've got just as many, vulnerabilities. I've got just as many, if not more, stakeholders. What do I if not more, stakeholders. What do I if not more, stakeholders. What do I really need to raise to them when and really need to raise to them when and really need to raise to them when and how? Um, what this allows us to do at how? Um, what this allows us to do at how? Um, what this allows us to do at SISA and the way that we've implemented SISA and the way that we've implemented SISA and the way that we've implemented SSVC is that it allows us to really SSVC is that it allows us to really SSVC is that it allows us to really focus on the state of exploitation, the focus on the state of exploitation, the focus on the state of exploitation, the prevalence, and the mission impact. So, I I'm putting this um SSVC impact. So, I I'm putting this um SSVC impact. So, I I'm putting this um SSVC tree up here because first of all, I tree up here because first of all, I tree up here because first of all, I really like decision trees. I've always really like decision trees. I've always really like decision trees. I've always liked them. I like them even more now liked them. I like them even more now liked them. I like them even more now and apply them to my own sort of and apply them to my own sort of and apply them to my own sort of personal like uh decision- making um personal like uh decision- making um personal like uh decision- making um activities in my own personal life. I activities in my own personal life. I activities in my own personal life. I think it can be really helpful. But I think it can be really helpful. But I think it can be really helpful. But I also wanted to show you I'm sure it's also wanted to show you I'm sure it's also wanted to show you I'm sure it's it's tiny on my screen. I'm sure it's it's tiny on my screen. I'm sure it's it's tiny on my screen. I'm sure it's small on your screen, but I hope you can small on your screen, but I hope you can small on your screen, but I hope you can kind of follow through that uh on the kind of follow through that uh on the kind of follow through that uh on the left hand side we have our very first left hand side we have our very first left hand side we have our very first decision point. What is the state of decision point. What is the state of decision point. What is the state of exploitation? You have several options. exploitation? You have several options. exploitation? You have several options. Anything from none to we know it's being Anything from none to we know it's being Anything from none to we know it's being actively exploited. Then you start to go actively exploited. Then you start to go actively exploited. Then you start to go into automatability, technical impact, into automatability, technical impact, into automatability, technical impact, etc., etc., etc., etc. On the next etc., etc., etc., etc. On the next etc., etc., etc., etc. On the next slide, if I can get there, I'm going to slide, if I can get there, I'm going to slide, if I can get there, I'm going to show you a different breakdown of the show you a different breakdown of the show you a different breakdown of the exact same information. This is um an exact same information. This is um an exact same information. This is um an outline of the sort of in order steps to outline of the sort of in order steps to outline of the sort of in order steps to walking through the SSBC tree as SISA walking through the SSBC tree as SISA walking through the SSBC tree as SISA uses it. Um this is an alternate view of uses it. Um this is an alternate view of uses it. Um this is an alternate view of the previous slide basically but this the previous slide basically but this the previous slide basically but this detailed view goes into slightly more detailed view goes into slightly more detailed view goes into slightly more detail about each decision point. One detail about each decision point. One detail about each decision point. One thing that my analysts told me like you thing that my analysts told me like you thing that my analysts told me like you have to say this, you know, as you're have to say this, you know, as you're have to say this, you know, as you're presenting this, they really want to presenting this, they really want to presenting this, they really want to make it clear that SISA has make it clear that SISA has make it clear that SISA has organizationally made decisions about organizationally made decisions about organizationally made decisions about how they want to implement SSVC and we how they want to implement SSVC and we how they want to implement SSVC and we share our SSVC decision tree and share our SSVC decision tree and share our SSVC decision tree and calculator and and all the information calculator and and all the information calculator and and all the information behind it via a paper on SIS's website. behind it via a paper on SIS's website. behind it via a paper on SIS's website. But SSVC has a fair a pretty good amount But SSVC has a fair a pretty good amount But SSVC has a fair a pretty good amount of flexibility for any organization that of flexibility for any organization that of flexibility for any organization that wants to implement it. So while the wants to implement it. So while the wants to implement it. So while the decision points may be relatively the decision points may be relatively the decision points may be relatively the same or each sort of decision within same or each sort of decision within same or each sort of decision within those points may be relatively the same, those points may be relatively the same, those points may be relatively the same, the way that you at your organization the way that you at your organization the way that you at your organization implement it um implement yeah the way implement it um implement yeah the way implement it um implement yeah the way that you implement it is um very that you implement it is um very that you implement it is um very curatable to your organizational needs. curatable to your organizational needs. curatable to your organizational needs. Um, again, this can be found in the SSVC Um, again, this can be found in the SSVC Um, again, this can be found in the SSVC paper on CIS's website, which I'm going paper on CIS's website, which I'm going paper on CIS's website, which I'm going to reference later in the references if to reference later in the references if to reference later in the references if we get to that we get to that we get to that slide. So, I think this is a an slide. So, I think this is a an slide. So, I think this is a an interesting piece of information that I interesting piece of information that I interesting piece of information that I I actually don't think a lot of people I actually don't think a lot of people I actually don't think a lot of people know. We've been using SSVC at CISA to know. We've been using SSVC at CISA to know. We've been using SSVC at CISA to prioritize vulnerabilities for 5 years. prioritize vulnerabilities for 5 years. prioritize vulnerabilities for 5 years. Um, April of 2020 is when we started Um, April of 2020 is when we started Um, April of 2020 is when we started using it. We've seen a lot of really using it. We've seen a lot of really using it. We've seen a lot of really good successes from using SSVC. the KV good successes from using SSVC. the KV good successes from using SSVC. the KV the known exploited vulnerabilities the known exploited vulnerabilities the known exploited vulnerabilities catalog um was certainly the first one catalog um was certainly the first one catalog um was certainly the first one in in November of 2021 and then since in in November of 2021 and then since in in November of 2021 and then since then we've started sharing successfully then we've started sharing successfully then we've started sharing successfully um our first three decision points um our first three decision points um our first three decision points publicly for every new CVE through publicly for every new CVE through publicly for every new CVE through vulnerrichment and through CISA's vulnerrichment and through CISA's vulnerrichment and through CISA's authorized data publisher or ADP authorized data publisher or ADP authorized data publisher or ADP capability. Um so I'll talk a little bit capability. Um so I'll talk a little bit capability. Um so I'll talk a little bit more about that as we sort of move on more about that as we sort of move on more about that as we sort of move on but this is another view of the decision but this is another view of the decision but this is another view of the decision tree itself. All right, these are what we call, All right, these are what we call, All right, these are what we call, pardon me, these are what we call the pardon me, these are what we call the pardon me, these are what we call the decision outcomes. Um, when you walk decision outcomes. Um, when you walk decision outcomes. Um, when you walk through, if you look at that tree on the through, if you look at that tree on the through, if you look at that tree on the previous slide, when you walk through previous slide, when you walk through previous slide, when you walk through that decision tree, you're ultimately that decision tree, you're ultimately that decision tree, you're ultimately going to end when you walk all the way going to end when you walk all the way going to end when you walk all the way through that decision tree, all you through that decision tree, all you through that decision tree, all you know, five decision points. When you get know, five decision points. When you get know, five decision points. When you get all the way to the end, you're going to all the way to the end, you're going to all the way to the end, you're going to come out with a decision outcome. Um we come out with a decision outcome. Um we come out with a decision outcome. Um we have four of them at CISA and we we uh have four of them at CISA and we we uh have four of them at CISA and we we uh name them as follows. We've got track um name them as follows. We've got track um name them as follows. We've got track um track star which we actually call track star which we actually call track star which we actually call monitor internally and are working on monitor internally and are working on monitor internally and are working on changing our public documentation to changing our public documentation to changing our public documentation to match um track monitor attend and act. match um track monitor attend and act. match um track monitor attend and act. You can see on this slide that we sort You can see on this slide that we sort You can see on this slide that we sort of have the like escalating um color of have the like escalating um color of have the like escalating um color scheme of like a stoplight, right? So a scheme of like a stoplight, right? So a scheme of like a stoplight, right? So a track uh track vulnerability has is track uh track vulnerability has is track uh track vulnerability has is associated with green. It gives you the associated with green. It gives you the associated with green. It gives you the good feelings and enact vulnerabilities good feelings and enact vulnerabilities good feelings and enact vulnerabilities associated with red. Everybody wants to associated with red. Everybody wants to associated with red. Everybody wants to make the color coding happen, you know. make the color coding happen, you know. make the color coding happen, you know. So, we we kind of went along with it. So, we we kind of went along with it. So, we we kind of went along with it. But essentially, these decision outcomes But essentially, these decision outcomes But essentially, these decision outcomes elevate our analysis um you know, the elevate our analysis um you know, the elevate our analysis um you know, the technical analysis that we're doing technical analysis that we're doing technical analysis that we're doing every day into a conversation that can every day into a conversation that can every day into a conversation that can be passed from one organizational group be passed from one organizational group be passed from one organizational group to the other. So for example, once my to the other. So for example, once my to the other. So for example, once my team does the technical analysis to team does the technical analysis to team does the technical analysis to determine that a CVE meets for example determine that a CVE meets for example determine that a CVE meets for example an attend or an act, we can really an attend or an act, we can really an attend or an act, we can really easily package that up with the easily package that up with the easily package that up with the associated decision outcome and sort of associated decision outcome and sort of associated decision outcome and sort of um you know transport it off to another um you know transport it off to another um you know transport it off to another team to action. Um I will say I have I team to action. Um I will say I have I team to action. Um I will say I have I am aware of othererts and like am aware of othererts and like am aware of othererts and like organizations that are much smaller than organizations that are much smaller than organizations that are much smaller than CISA that also use SSVC and their CISA that also use SSVC and their CISA that also use SSVC and their various teams are not as perhaps um various teams are not as perhaps um various teams are not as perhaps um disparate or large or spread out as disparate or large or spread out as disparate or large or spread out as SISAs and they can still effectively use SISAs and they can still effectively use SISAs and they can still effectively use SSVC in this way. They just maybe have a SSVC in this way. They just maybe have a SSVC in this way. They just maybe have a a closer you know the person who makes a closer you know the person who makes a closer you know the person who makes the who does the analysis and lands on the who does the analysis and lands on the who does the analysis and lands on the decision may have a closer the decision may have a closer the decision may have a closer relationship or closer proximity to the relationship or closer proximity to the relationship or closer proximity to the person who actions it. they may even be person who actions it. they may even be person who actions it. they may even be the same person. Um, at SISA, that's not the same person. Um, at SISA, that's not the same person. Um, at SISA, that's not always the case. So, what is SIS what does SSVC case. So, what is SIS what does SSVC case. So, what is SIS what does SSVC mean to SISA? Um, I'm going to talk a mean to SISA? Um, I'm going to talk a mean to SISA? Um, I'm going to talk a little bit about it from my perspective. little bit about it from my perspective. little bit about it from my perspective. O as the person who's sort of um over O as the person who's sort of um over O as the person who's sort of um over the analysis side and as the team who's the analysis side and as the team who's the analysis side and as the team who's over the analysis side. But I'm also over the analysis side. But I'm also over the analysis side. But I'm also going to pass over to to Sean because going to pass over to to Sean because going to pass over to to Sean because like I said in the previous slide like I said in the previous slide like I said in the previous slide because we are a large organization this because we are a large organization this because we are a large organization this responsibility of actioning and and um responsibility of actioning and and um responsibility of actioning and and um operationalizing SS actioning the operationalizing SS actioning the operationalizing SS actioning the decision points and operationalizing decision points and operationalizing decision points and operationalizing SSVC is shared across a lot of SSVC is shared across a lot of SSVC is shared across a lot of organizational units. So first I'll talk organizational units. So first I'll talk organizational units. So first I'll talk about the repeatability over time. The about the repeatability over time. The about the repeatability over time. The fact that we can do this at this point, fact that we can do this at this point, fact that we can do this at this point, we can do at least the first three we can do at least the first three we can do at least the first three decision points for every single new CVE decision points for every single new CVE decision points for every single new CVE um is pretty fantastic. Uh we can also um is pretty fantastic. Uh we can also um is pretty fantastic. Uh we can also we do it the same way every time. It's we do it the same way every time. It's we do it the same way every time. It's very consistent across analysts. It's very consistent across analysts. It's very consistent across analysts. It's very consistent um accord because we very consistent um accord because we very consistent um accord because we have our our SSVC training guide very have our our SSVC training guide very have our our SSVC training guide very consistent from team to team and consistent from team to team and consistent from team to team and therefore the interpretation is quite therefore the interpretation is quite therefore the interpretation is quite consistent as well. And here I'll pass consistent as well. And here I'll pass consistent as well. And here I'll pass it over to Sean. it over to Sean. it over to Sean. Uh thank you Lindsay. Appreciate that. Uh thank you Lindsay. Appreciate that. Uh thank you Lindsay. Appreciate that. Okay. So uh after what Lindsay had said Okay. So uh after what Lindsay had said Okay. So uh after what Lindsay had said about this being consistent and about this being consistent and about this being consistent and repeatable over time, that is actually a repeatable over time, that is actually a repeatable over time, that is actually a very important facet uh when it comes to very important facet uh when it comes to very important facet uh when it comes to what my team does and how we execute and what my team does and how we execute and what my team does and how we execute and operationalize the information that we operationalize the information that we operationalize the information that we get from Lindsay's team. So when we when get from Lindsay's team. So when we when get from Lindsay's team. So when we when Lindsay and her team score something Lindsay and her team score something Lindsay and her team score something using the SSVC, score a vulnerability using the SSVC, score a vulnerability using the SSVC, score a vulnerability using the SSVC, uh my team then actually using the SSVC, uh my team then actually using the SSVC, uh my team then actually takes that score, brings it across CSD takes that score, brings it across CSD takes that score, brings it across CSD and talks about what are we going to do and talks about what are we going to do and talks about what are we going to do with this information. And the good with this information. And the good with this information. And the good thing about SSVC is that it has given us thing about SSVC is that it has given us thing about SSVC is that it has given us sort of a framework to derive a menu of sort of a framework to derive a menu of sort of a framework to derive a menu of option. Now we'll talk on the next slide option. Now we'll talk on the next slide option. Now we'll talk on the next slide about where some friction points might about where some friction points might about where some friction points might be and some of those do still exist but be and some of those do still exist but be and some of those do still exist but by and large we are able to decide ve by and large we are able to decide ve by and large we are able to decide ve relatively quickly what is the action we relatively quickly what is the action we relatively quickly what is the action we are going to take based on the decision are going to take based on the decision are going to take based on the decision outcome from SSVC. Now with SIZA um outcome from SSVC. Now with SIZA um outcome from SSVC. Now with SIZA um again as I had mentioned before we don't again as I had mentioned before we don't again as I had mentioned before we don't actually take any remediation but we do actually take any remediation but we do actually take any remediation but we do drive remediation and mitigation action drive remediation and mitigation action drive remediation and mitigation action especially across the federal especially across the federal especially across the federal government. So most of our action that government. So most of our action that government. So most of our action that we take involves communication and just we take involves communication and just we take involves communication and just going down through a a various menu of going down through a a various menu of going down through a a various menu of options that we use. your organization options that we use. your organization options that we use. your organization may be different but that we use to may be different but that we use to may be different but that we use to really how are we going to deliver this really how are we going to deliver this really how are we going to deliver this message to organizations right I had message to organizations right I had message to organizations right I had mentioned some of the alerts that we do mentioned some of the alerts that we do mentioned some of the alerts that we do some of the other products that we're some of the other products that we're some of the other products that we're able to put out as a group but really it able to put out as a group but really it able to put out as a group but really it goes down from are we trying to create goes down from are we trying to create goes down from are we trying to create awareness or are we trying to drive awareness or are we trying to drive awareness or are we trying to drive action so on sort of the the the lower action so on sort of the the the lower action so on sort of the the the lower end less impactful edge of this scale we end less impactful edge of this scale we end less impactful edge of this scale we will create sort of an awareness will create sort of an awareness will create sort of an awareness campaign where maybe we're putting out campaign where maybe we're putting out campaign where maybe we're putting out an alert. Maybe we're updating the an alert. Maybe we're updating the an alert. Maybe we're updating the website. Maybe we are just amplifying website. Maybe we are just amplifying website. Maybe we are just amplifying the security advisory that we got from a the security advisory that we got from a the security advisory that we got from a vendor and just sort of, you know, vendor and just sort of, you know, vendor and just sort of, you know, double that, put it out and add it into double that, put it out and add it into double that, put it out and add it into our kind of weekly rollups. On the far our kind of weekly rollups. On the far our kind of weekly rollups. On the far more extreme end of the the spectrum, we more extreme end of the the spectrum, we more extreme end of the the spectrum, we will actually drop an emergency will actually drop an emergency will actually drop an emergency directive. And that emergency directive directive. And that emergency directive directive. And that emergency directive will mandate that organizations within will mandate that organizations within will mandate that organizations within the federal government take specific the federal government take specific the federal government take specific action relatively quickly with very action relatively quickly with very action relatively quickly with very little wiggle room and within a specific little wiggle room and within a specific little wiggle room and within a specific time frame. Most of those are going to time frame. Most of those are going to time frame. Most of those are going to be obviously on your ACT side of the be obviously on your ACT side of the be obviously on your ACT side of the house, right? And then depending on a house, right? And then depending on a house, right? And then depending on a couple of minor factors beyond that, couple of minor factors beyond that, couple of minor factors beyond that, that's going to drive our action and that's going to drive our action and that's going to drive our action and really determine how do we get from A to really determine how do we get from A to really determine how do we get from A to B. um really important also and it's up B. um really important also and it's up B. um really important also and it's up there in red because I and I consider it there in red because I and I consider it there in red because I and I consider it my job and Lindsay and I talk you know my job and Lindsay and I talk you know my job and Lindsay and I talk you know her and I her her team and my team we her and I her her team and my team we her and I her her team and my team we talk very frequently and one of the talk very frequently and one of the talk very frequently and one of the other options not only do we have this other options not only do we have this other options not only do we have this sort of responsibility to make everybody sort of responsibility to make everybody sort of responsibility to make everybody aware of the fact that like look this is aware of the fact that like look this is aware of the fact that like look this is bad this is going to have impact uh we bad this is going to have impact uh we bad this is going to have impact uh we need to be paying attention to this we need to be paying attention to this we need to be paying attention to this we need to sift through the smoke and need to sift through the smoke and need to sift through the smoke and really focus on this one we also have really focus on this one we also have really focus on this one we also have the obligation to spin down, right? So, the obligation to spin down, right? So, the obligation to spin down, right? So, everybody's heard about spinning up. We everybody's heard about spinning up. We everybody's heard about spinning up. We also have an obligation to spin down. also have an obligation to spin down. also have an obligation to spin down. And SSVC really gives us a great tool to And SSVC really gives us a great tool to And SSVC really gives us a great tool to do that because, as Lindsay had do that because, as Lindsay had do that because, as Lindsay had mentioned, it's focused on mission mentioned, it's focused on mission mentioned, it's focused on mission impact, exploitability, and prevalence, impact, exploitability, and prevalence, impact, exploitability, and prevalence, right? Prevalence. How many of these right? Prevalence. How many of these right? Prevalence. How many of these devices, how many places do we see this devices, how many places do we see this devices, how many places do we see this vulnerability? Um, and really, if you vulnerability? Um, and really, if you vulnerability? Um, and really, if you have a good look at that and you have a good look at that and you have a good look at that and you leverage it the right way, you can leverage it the right way, you can leverage it the right way, you can really see where these decisions are really see where these decisions are really see where these decisions are made. And I'll give you one example. One made. And I'll give you one example. One made. And I'll give you one example. One example from a couple of years ago is example from a couple of years ago is example from a couple of years ago is CVE 202320593 which uh was known within the 202320593 which uh was known within the 202320593 which uh was known within the media as Zenle uh which was a a media as Zenle uh which was a a media as Zenle uh which was a a vulnerability that affected AMD chips vulnerability that affected AMD chips vulnerability that affected AMD chips right and it was very prevalent billions right and it was very prevalent billions right and it was very prevalent billions of chips and billions of devices right of chips and billions of devices right of chips and billions of devices right it hit the media and there was a big it hit the media and there was a big it hit the media and there was a big giant splash and to be quite honest with giant splash and to be quite honest with giant splash and to be quite honest with you it kind of caught me by surprise you it kind of caught me by surprise you it kind of caught me by surprise with how high this went up within the with how high this went up within the with how high this went up within the federal government and kind of the federal government and kind of the federal government and kind of the demands signal for action that was demands signal for action that was demands signal for action that was coming down really from just one or two coming down really from just one or two coming down really from just one or two media articles. So when Lindsay and I media articles. So when Lindsay and I media articles. So when Lindsay and I put our heads together, we ran this put our heads together, we ran this put our heads together, we ran this particular vulnerability through the particular vulnerability through the particular vulnerability through the SSVC scoring system. We scored it as a SSVC scoring system. We scored it as a SSVC scoring system. We scored it as a track star, which again, if you remember track star, which again, if you remember track star, which again, if you remember from Lindsay a couple minutes ago, that from Lindsay a couple minutes ago, that from Lindsay a couple minutes ago, that just means monitor, right? So we brought just means monitor, right? So we brought just means monitor, right? So we brought that to the table across the that to the table across the that to the table across the organization, across the federal organization, across the federal organization, across the federal government. We explained to everybody government. We explained to everybody government. We explained to everybody how we got there, what was the how we got there, what was the how we got there, what was the parameters that really required parameters that really required parameters that really required exploitation of this particular CVE and exploitation of this particular CVE and exploitation of this particular CVE and we were able to, you know, quote unquote we were able to, you know, quote unquote we were able to, you know, quote unquote walk everybody back off the ledge, walk everybody back off the ledge, walk everybody back off the ledge, right? Um, and really that was made right? Um, and really that was made right? Um, and really that was made possible by SSVC and that scoring possible by SSVC and that scoring possible by SSVC and that scoring system. CVS had it scored at like a 9.8. system. CVS had it scored at like a 9.8. system. CVS had it scored at like a 9.8. So at first glance you say 9.8 across So at first glance you say 9.8 across So at first glance you say 9.8 across billions of devices, we're in all kinds billions of devices, we're in all kinds billions of devices, we're in all kinds of trouble. No, no, we're really not of trouble. No, no, we're really not of trouble. No, no, we're really not right because the conditions that are right because the conditions that are right because the conditions that are required to exploit this didn't exist in required to exploit this didn't exist in required to exploit this didn't exist in 99.9% of those devices. Uh, next slide, 99.9% of those devices. Uh, next slide, 99.9% of those devices. Uh, next slide, please, Lindsay. please, Lindsay. please, Lindsay. Oh, I think first I have a picture. Oh, I think first I have a picture. Oh, I think first I have a picture. Sorry, this is really important to me. I Sorry, this is really important to me. I Sorry, this is really important to me. I have a picture of this is actually Sean have a picture of this is actually Sean have a picture of this is actually Sean in action spinning down the entire in action spinning down the entire in action spinning down the entire federal government about Zenble. Looks federal government about Zenble. Looks federal government about Zenble. Looks pretty cool. Sorry. Hey, you got to have pretty cool. Sorry. Hey, you got to have pretty cool. Sorry. Hey, you got to have some fun sometimes. some fun sometimes. some fun sometimes. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. There we go. Um, okay. Yeah. So, diving There we go. Um, okay. Yeah. So, diving There we go. Um, okay. Yeah. So, diving into prerequisites, and I'm just going into prerequisites, and I'm just going into prerequisites, and I'm just going to take one second to really talk about to take one second to really talk about to take one second to really talk about this, and then I'll pass it along. Um, a this, and then I'll pass it along. Um, a this, and then I'll pass it along. Um, a prerequisite to success in using the prerequisite to success in using the prerequisite to success in using the SSVC is you have to have buy in. You SSVC is you have to have buy in. You SSVC is you have to have buy in. You have to have not only executive buyin, have to have not only executive buyin, have to have not only executive buyin, but your fellow analysts that are across but your fellow analysts that are across but your fellow analysts that are across the organization have to understand the organization have to understand the organization have to understand where this came from and really what it where this came from and really what it where this came from and really what it gives them, right? Um, as I explained gives them, right? Um, as I explained gives them, right? Um, as I explained way in the very beginning, vulnerability way in the very beginning, vulnerability way in the very beginning, vulnerability management, our team is left of an management, our team is left of an management, our team is left of an incident, right? We want to prevent incident, right? We want to prevent incident, right? We want to prevent something from happen. We also work something from happen. We also work something from happen. We also work very, very closely with our threat very, very closely with our threat very, very closely with our threat hunting colleagues and our our incident hunting colleagues and our our incident hunting colleagues and our our incident response colleagues who are really response colleagues who are really response colleagues who are really tearing down the doors when something tearing down the doors when something tearing down the doors when something happens, right? We have spent an happens, right? We have spent an happens, right? We have spent an enormous amount of time making sure that enormous amount of time making sure that enormous amount of time making sure that they understand the SSVC scoring system. they understand the SSVC scoring system. they understand the SSVC scoring system. So even if they come across an incident, So even if they come across an incident, So even if they come across an incident, right, maybe something was exploited, right, maybe something was exploited, right, maybe something was exploited, we're able to go back, look at the we're able to go back, look at the we're able to go back, look at the characteristics of that vulnerability, characteristics of that vulnerability, characteristics of that vulnerability, plug it into the SSVC scoring system, plug it into the SSVC scoring system, plug it into the SSVC scoring system, and come to an understanding about where and come to an understanding about where and come to an understanding about where we're going to go forward on this. Um, we're going to go forward on this. Um, we're going to go forward on this. Um, we've tried across the organization, we've tried across the organization, we've tried across the organization, especially within CSD, multiple especially within CSD, multiple especially within CSD, multiple different prioritization schemas within different prioritization schemas within different prioritization schemas within VM. We've adopted heat maps. We've VM. We've adopted heat maps. We've VM. We've adopted heat maps. We've tried, you know, uh, numerical weighted tried, you know, uh, numerical weighted tried, you know, uh, numerical weighted scores to get from the top to bottom and scores to get from the top to bottom and scores to get from the top to bottom and none of that really helped us, right? none of that really helped us, right? none of that really helped us, right? And it really created a lot of confusion And it really created a lot of confusion And it really created a lot of confusion and some of it was just flat out and some of it was just flat out and some of it was just flat out contradictory. Um, there is some contradictory. Um, there is some contradictory. Um, there is some friction points using SSVC. There is friction points using SSVC. There is friction points using SSVC. There is room for refinement and I'll let Lindsay room for refinement and I'll let Lindsay room for refinement and I'll let Lindsay get Lindsay get into that again in a get Lindsay get into that again in a get Lindsay get into that again in a minute. But really if you have that minute. But really if you have that minute. But really if you have that total buyin from across the organization total buyin from across the organization total buyin from across the organization from across your teams is an incredibly from across your teams is an incredibly from across your teams is an incredibly valuable tool that can serve you for a valuable tool that can serve you for a valuable tool that can serve you for a very long very long very long time. Go ahead Lindsay. Next slide and time. Go ahead Lindsay. Next slide and time. Go ahead Lindsay. Next slide and then it's yours. I knew I was going to do that. yours. I knew I was going to do that. yours. I knew I was going to do that. Muted myself so I could cough without Muted myself so I could cough without Muted myself so I could cough without blowing everybody's eardrums up and I blowing everybody's eardrums up and I blowing everybody's eardrums up and I knew I was going to do that. Anyways, knew I was going to do that. Anyways, knew I was going to do that. Anyways, I've got a few more slides. I know we're I've got a few more slides. I know we're I've got a few more slides. I know we're running a little bit late because of running a little bit late because of running a little bit late because of technical issues. So, I will try to go technical issues. So, I will try to go technical issues. So, I will try to go relatively quickly through these and relatively quickly through these and relatively quickly through these and then maybe we can talk about our lessons then maybe we can talk about our lessons then maybe we can talk about our lessons learned as we're sort of talking through learned as we're sort of talking through learned as we're sort of talking through these. So, I want to talk a little bit these. So, I want to talk a little bit these. So, I want to talk a little bit about SSV and SSVC and enrichment about SSV and SSVC and enrichment about SSV and SSVC and enrichment because it um if you went to my talk because it um if you went to my talk because it um if you went to my talk yesterday or of course I referenced back yesterday or of course I referenced back yesterday or of course I referenced back to it earlier um in this conversation, to it earlier um in this conversation, to it earlier um in this conversation, but um I think it's really important to but um I think it's really important to but um I think it's really important to to try to communicate this part to you to try to communicate this part to you to try to communicate this part to you all. So all. So all. So um with those first three decision um with those first three decision um with those first three decision points analysts really I mean they go points analysts really I mean they go points analysts really I mean they go through it thousands of times right and through it thousands of times right and through it thousands of times right and so they really develop this kind of so they really develop this kind of so they really develop this kind of mental model where they can almost look mental model where they can almost look mental model where they can almost look at a vulnerability description they can at a vulnerability description they can at a vulnerability description they can look at the CVSS they have you know look at the CVSS they have you know look at the CVSS they have you know mentally cataloged a good understanding mentally cataloged a good understanding mentally cataloged a good understanding of um you know what our sort of biggest of um you know what our sort of biggest of um you know what our sort of biggest uh um attack surface issues are and they uh um attack surface issues are and they uh um attack surface issues are and they can really do those first three decision can really do those first three decision can really do those first three decision points super fast and then they can can points super fast and then they can can points super fast and then they can can kind of come to a mental decision kind of come to a mental decision kind of come to a mental decision outcome super fast also. But of course outcome super fast also. But of course outcome super fast also. But of course we need to do this systematically in a we need to do this systematically in a we need to do this systematically in a way so that the decision outcomes can be way so that the decision outcomes can be way so that the decision outcomes can be shared across the organization. So we do shared across the organization. So we do shared across the organization. So we do have both an internal tracking mechanism have both an internal tracking mechanism have both an internal tracking mechanism um which is just a basically a ticketing um which is just a basically a ticketing um which is just a basically a ticketing system that we track on and then we have system that we track on and then we have system that we track on and then we have our public um we made the decision to our public um we made the decision to our public um we made the decision to share publicly those first three share publicly those first three share publicly those first three decision points so that organizations decision points so that organizations decision points so that organizations could try to more could try to more could try to more um I guess efficiently and more quickly um I guess efficiently and more quickly um I guess efficiently and more quickly um embrace SSVC for their own decision- um embrace SSVC for their own decision- um embrace SSVC for their own decision- making. um every CVE and I have an making. um every CVE and I have an making. um every CVE and I have an asterisk here because there are some asterisk here because there are some asterisk here because there are some exceptions but almost every CVE uh gets exceptions but almost every CVE uh gets exceptions but almost every CVE uh gets that those first three decision points that those first three decision points that those first three decision points and then that output is shared in SIS's and then that output is shared in SIS's and then that output is shared in SIS's full enrichment GitHub in the CVE record full enrichment GitHub in the CVE record full enrichment GitHub in the CVE record JSON but also through all also through JSON but also through all also through JSON but also through all also through CIS's authorized data publisher um role CIS's authorized data publisher um role CIS's authorized data publisher um role in the CVE program. So in the original in the CVE program. So in the original in the CVE program. So in the original CVE record I've got a little screenshot CVE record I've got a little screenshot CVE record I've got a little screenshot over on the side. It's this may be too over on the side. It's this may be too over on the side. It's this may be too down in the weeds for people to care. I down in the weeds for people to care. I down in the weeds for people to care. I don't know. But if you look at a a CVE don't know. But if you look at a a CVE don't know. But if you look at a a CVE records um ADP container within the records um ADP container within the records um ADP container within the JSON, you'll see SISA's SSVC decision, JSON, you'll see SISA's SSVC decision, JSON, you'll see SISA's SSVC decision, the first three SSVC decision points the first three SSVC decision points the first three SSVC decision points there. This is just a totally random there. This is just a totally random there. This is just a totally random recent CVE. But you can see exploitation recent CVE. But you can see exploitation recent CVE. But you can see exploitation is none. We assessed it to not be is none. We assessed it to not be is none. We assessed it to not be automatable and we said that the uh automatable and we said that the uh automatable and we said that the uh technical impact was partial versus technical impact was partial versus technical impact was partial versus total. All right. All of that is shared total. All right. All of that is shared total. All right. All of that is shared publicly but it is also synced synced publicly but it is also synced synced publicly but it is also synced synced with our internal tracking of SSVC with our internal tracking of SSVC with our internal tracking of SSVC scoring which is not shared publicly. Um scoring which is not shared publicly. Um scoring which is not shared publicly. Um so on the internal side we do the so on the internal side we do the so on the internal side we do the mission prevalence and well-being. A lot mission prevalence and well-being. A lot mission prevalence and well-being. A lot of this is based on what we determine to of this is based on what we determine to of this is based on what we determine to be prevalent across our stakeholder set be prevalent across our stakeholder set be prevalent across our stakeholder set which as you saw is pretty large but we which as you saw is pretty large but we which as you saw is pretty large but we focus really heavily on what we think is focus really heavily on what we think is focus really heavily on what we think is in fab and and SLT. Um and we also focus in fab and and SLT. Um and we also focus in fab and and SLT. Um and we also focus on the impact of the uh of the technical on the impact of the uh of the technical on the impact of the uh of the technical the potential technical impact of that the potential technical impact of that the potential technical impact of that vulnerability um on the performance of vulnerability um on the performance of vulnerability um on the performance of that that specific technology. So some that that specific technology. So some that that specific technology. So some of the resource or some of the sources of the resource or some of the sources of the resource or some of the sources that we use for that information are that we use for that information are that we use for that information are quantitative. For example, we use quantitative. For example, we use quantitative. For example, we use scanning results um from you know scanning results um from you know scanning results um from you know multiple different sort of services that multiple different sort of services that multiple different sort of services that we offer uh to FSUB. And we also have we offer uh to FSUB. And we also have we offer uh to FSUB. And we also have some qualitative sources for some qualitative sources for some qualitative sources for information. So, we use like public information. So, we use like public information. So, we use like public acquisition res uh records, we use acquisition res uh records, we use acquisition res uh records, we use market research, things like that. Um, market research, things like that. Um, market research, things like that. Um, in cases that are maybe not as in cases that are maybe not as in cases that are maybe not as clear-cut. Um, and then I put in the clear-cut. Um, and then I put in the clear-cut. Um, and then I put in the little like magical, you know, till days little like magical, you know, till days little like magical, you know, till days experience because actually our our experience because actually our our experience because actually our our analysts have been scoring for years and analysts have been scoring for years and analysts have been scoring for years and in addition to that, they've been at in addition to that, they've been at in addition to that, they've been at CISA or with the federal government for CISA or with the federal government for CISA or with the federal government for many years in some cases or adjacent to many years in some cases or adjacent to many years in some cases or adjacent to federal government. they really federal government. they really federal government. they really understand what technology could have a understand what technology could have a understand what technology could have a real and meaningful impact on the real and meaningful impact on the real and meaningful impact on the federal government. And then of course federal government. And then of course federal government. And then of course we do not share our decision outcomes we do not share our decision outcomes we do not share our decision outcomes publicly because we do those first three publicly because we do those first three publicly because we do those first three steps for every CVE. We have a really steps for every CVE. We have a really steps for every CVE. We have a really good idea of what we actually need to good idea of what we actually need to good idea of what we actually need to follow through to the end. We don't do follow through to the end. We don't do follow through to the end. We don't do all CVEs until um follow them all all CVEs until um follow them all all CVEs until um follow them all through the decision tree. But my next through the decision tree. But my next through the decision tree. But my next slide, I know I need to hurry, so I'm slide, I know I need to hurry, so I'm slide, I know I need to hurry, so I'm going to try, but I'm really passionate going to try, but I'm really passionate going to try, but I'm really passionate about this part. Um, this kind of shows about this part. Um, this kind of shows about this part. Um, this kind of shows you the the like num by the numbers what you the the like num by the numbers what you the the like num by the numbers what SSVC does for us. For those first three SSVC does for us. For those first three SSVC does for us. For those first three decision points since uh since full decision points since uh since full decision points since uh since full enrichment has started in I think enrichment has started in I think enrichment has started in I think February of 2024, we've scored something February of 2024, we've scored something February of 2024, we've scored something like 46,000 vulnerabilities, maybe a like 46,000 vulnerabilities, maybe a like 46,000 vulnerabilities, maybe a little bit over. Those are all enriched little bit over. Those are all enriched little bit over. Those are all enriched with those first three decision points with those first three decision points with those first three decision points publicly. They're also tracked publicly. They're also tracked publicly. They're also tracked internally. Um, that's exploitation, internally. Um, that's exploitation, internally. Um, that's exploitation, autom automatability, and technical autom automatability, and technical autom automatability, and technical impact. Um but then of those 46,000 we impact. Um but then of those 46,000 we impact. Um but then of those 46,000 we actually take a pretty small amount to actually take a pretty small amount to actually take a pretty small amount to follow through to the actual decision follow through to the actual decision follow through to the actual decision outcome because we can tell from those outcome because we can tell from those outcome because we can tell from those first three decision points uh which first three decision points uh which first three decision points uh which things are going to be relevant to CISA. things are going to be relevant to CISA. things are going to be relevant to CISA. I want to say under 10% of those 46,000 I want to say under 10% of those 46,000 I want to say under 10% of those 46,000 do we actually ingest and then I mean do we actually ingest and then I mean do we actually ingest and then I mean not ingest but do we actually take not ingest but do we actually take not ingest but do we actually take further through that decision tree further through that decision tree further through that decision tree process in our own internal um system of process in our own internal um system of process in our own internal um system of those vulnerabilities that we further those vulnerabilities that we further those vulnerabilities that we further score which I would argue is already a score which I would argue is already a score which I would argue is already a skewed number because we've taken things skewed number because we've taken things skewed number because we've taken things that we really think have an impact and that we really think have an impact and that we really think have an impact and probably will score higher only around probably will score higher only around probably will score higher only around 8% are actually actioned 3% land on acts 8% are actually actioned 3% land on acts 8% are actually actioned 3% land on acts acts that usually means that they're acts that usually means that they're acts that usually means that they're exploited um some of those end up on the exploited um some of those end up on the exploited um some of those end up on the kev kev kev and five about 5% end with attend where and five about 5% end with attend where and five about 5% end with attend where we do sort of further messaging to FSB we do sort of further messaging to FSB we do sort of further messaging to FSB communities and even maybe to the communities and even maybe to the communities and even maybe to the public and I will move on to the next public and I will move on to the next public and I will move on to the next slide. All right, I'm really quickly slide. All right, I'm really quickly slide. All right, I'm really quickly talk about lessons learned. As the talk about lessons learned. As the talk about lessons learned. As the organization grows, SSVC has to grow organization grows, SSVC has to grow organization grows, SSVC has to grow too. Um I think Sean mentioned this ear too. Um I think Sean mentioned this ear too. Um I think Sean mentioned this ear earlier. One of the prerequisites for earlier. One of the prerequisites for earlier. One of the prerequisites for success is that iterative quality of success is that iterative quality of success is that iterative quality of SSVC and that willingness to continually SSVC and that willingness to continually SSVC and that willingness to continually improve the process. If you're running improve the process. If you're running improve the process. If you're running up against friction with your SSVC up against friction with your SSVC up against friction with your SSVC system, it's the system that needs to be system, it's the system that needs to be system, it's the system that needs to be changed, not your analysts, not your changed, not your analysts, not your changed, not your analysts, not your executives. It just means that system executives. It just means that system executives. It just means that system needs to be re-evaluated for, you know, needs to be re-evaluated for, you know, needs to be re-evaluated for, you know, um, appropriateness for your um, appropriateness for your um, appropriateness for your organization. Different trees for organization. Different trees for organization. Different trees for different triages. This is something different triages. This is something different triages. This is something that we've learned. Our organization is that we've learned. Our organization is that we've learned. Our organization is huge. Our area of responsibility is huge. Our area of responsibility is huge. Our area of responsibility is huge. We might need a tree for FSB and huge. We might need a tree for FSB and huge. We might need a tree for FSB and we might need a tree for, you know, we might need a tree for, you know, we might need a tree for, you know, operational technology and indust operational technology and indust operational technology and indust industrial control systems technology. industrial control systems technology. industrial control systems technology. that is something that we are exploring that is something that we are exploring that is something that we are exploring right now. And then finally, this is right now. And then finally, this is right now. And then finally, this is sort of um VM's I guess current ethos sort of um VM's I guess current ethos sort of um VM's I guess current ethos and our something we care a lot about, a and our something we care a lot about, a and our something we care a lot about, a core pillar and tenant of our our core pillar and tenant of our our core pillar and tenant of our our programs. We want to share what we can programs. We want to share what we can programs. We want to share what we can publicly. We're producing a lot of this publicly. We're producing a lot of this publicly. We're producing a lot of this information and not all of it is sort of information and not all of it is sort of information and not all of it is sort of private information. And we feel that private information. And we feel that private information. And we feel that sharing that in the public um space sharing that in the public um space sharing that in the public um space gives gives you know allows our allows gives gives you know allows our allows gives gives you know allows our allows and enables our work to be sort of and enables our work to be sort of and enables our work to be sort of consumed as a public service and that's consumed as a public service and that's consumed as a public service and that's something that's really important to us. something that's really important to us. something that's really important to us. I think I'm getting to the end and I'm I think I'm getting to the end and I'm I think I'm getting to the end and I'm definitely rushing because I I realize definitely rushing because I I realize definitely rushing because I I realize that we're five minutes over, but some that we're five minutes over, but some that we're five minutes over, but some future developments that I've already future developments that I've already future developments that I've already talked about. Um, we are continuing to talked about. Um, we are continuing to talked about. Um, we are continuing to brief stakeholders on SSVC and how SISA brief stakeholders on SSVC and how SISA brief stakeholders on SSVC and how SISA implements it. We are incorporating implements it. We are incorporating implements it. We are incorporating SSVNC into more tools. Full enrichment SSVNC into more tools. Full enrichment SSVNC into more tools. Full enrichment has made this way easier because people has made this way easier because people has made this way easier because people can just ingest SSVC as a JSON, you can just ingest SSVC as a JSON, you can just ingest SSVC as a JSON, you know, as JSON and and then do kind of know, as JSON and and then do kind of know, as JSON and and then do kind of whatever they want with it, which is whatever they want with it, which is whatever they want with it, which is great. That feeds into the longer term. great. That feeds into the longer term. great. That feeds into the longer term. Um, we would love to help vendors build Um, we would love to help vendors build Um, we would love to help vendors build SSVC into their risk dashboards. We have SSVC into their risk dashboards. We have SSVC into their risk dashboards. We have conversations with them all the time conversations with them all the time conversations with them all the time about this. I think many already are. about this. I think many already are. about this. I think many already are. And then I mentioned that IC SSVC tree. And then I mentioned that IC SSVC tree. And then I mentioned that IC SSVC tree. That's something we're really exploring That's something we're really exploring That's something we're really exploring and and trying to figure out what makes and and trying to figure out what makes and and trying to figure out what makes sense for our organization as we sense for our organization as we sense for our organization as we consider those more operational consider those more operational consider those more operational technology um and and sort of ICS technology um and and sort of ICS technology um and and sort of ICS technologies. We have some public technologies. We have some public technologies. We have some public resources. I saw a question about public resources. I saw a question about public resources. I saw a question about public resourcing. If you go to cysa.govssvc, resourcing. If you go to cysa.govssvc, resourcing. If you go to cysa.govssvc, /svc you can find our guide and um it /svc you can find our guide and um it /svc you can find our guide and um it outlines how CISA uses SSVC in our outlines how CISA uses SSVC in our outlines how CISA uses SSVC in our decision tree. We also have a calculator decision tree. We also have a calculator decision tree. We also have a calculator there. So I think that's a really good there. So I think that's a really good there. So I think that's a really good resource. All right, I made it to the resource. All right, I made it to the resource. All right, I made it to the end with only you know minus negative end with only you know minus negative end with only you know minus negative six minutes to spare. Um I not in the six minutes to spare. Um I not in the six minutes to spare. Um I not in the room so I don't know if there are room so I don't know if there are room so I don't know if there are questions but I'm assuming that someone questions but I'm assuming that someone questions but I'm assuming that someone in the room might be able to kind of in the room might be able to kind of in the room might be able to kind of help us help us help us navigate. Uh, I see the question from navigate. Uh, I see the question from navigate. Uh, I see the question from Discord. Is the SSVC training guide Discord. Is the SSVC training guide Discord. Is the SSVC training guide publicly available? Yes, we have CIS publicly available? Yes, we have CIS publicly available? Yes, we have CIS SSVC. Thank you, Sean. CIS SV SSVC SSVC. Thank you, Sean. CIS SV SSVC SSVC. Thank you, Sean. CIS SV SSVC resources are on the www.sissa.govssvc. Um, and if you have www.sissa.govssvc. Um, and if you have www.sissa.govssvc. Um, and if you have any questions, of course, you're welcome any questions, of course, you're welcome any questions, of course, you're welcome to email us at to email us at to email us at vulnerability@mail.sysa.dhs.gov. Lindsay and Sean, thank you very much. Lindsay and Sean, thank you very much. Lindsay and Sean, thank you very much. Uh, we'll direct questions to Discord Uh, we'll direct questions to Discord Uh, we'll direct questions to Discord since we are over time. Um, let's uh since we are over time.
