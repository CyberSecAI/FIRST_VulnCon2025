Kind: captions Language: en Hi, I'm Maui. Uh, welcome to this talk. Hi, I'm Maui. Uh, welcome to this talk. Hi, I'm Maui. Uh, welcome to this talk. So, we are in that part of the So, we are in that part of the So, we are in that part of the conference where there are not many conference where there are not many conference where there are not many parallel tracks going. So, I checked the parallel tracks going. So, I checked the parallel tracks going. So, I checked the um the program. There are apparently two um the program. There are apparently two um the program. There are apparently two parallel tracks going for this time slot parallel tracks going for this time slot parallel tracks going for this time slot like this one and the other one. So, I'm like this one and the other one. So, I'm like this one and the other one. So, I'm a little bit disappointed about uh so I a little bit disappointed about uh so I a little bit disappointed about uh so I expected a few more people here. uh but expected a few more people here. uh but expected a few more people here. uh but I'm the guy who's talking or who will be I'm the guy who's talking or who will be I'm the guy who's talking or who will be talking for one hour so I can understand talking for one hour so I can understand talking for one hour so I can understand that I'm I may be coming in between you that I'm I may be coming in between you that I'm I may be coming in between you and your networking break but anyway uh and your networking break but anyway uh and your networking break but anyway uh so I'll be talking about some stories um so I'll be talking about some stories um so I'll be talking about some stories um about some wild things in supply chain about some wild things in supply chain about some wild things in supply chain security um and what we security um and what we security um and what we have been working in the in this area have been working in the in this area have been working in the in this area for the as a company we have been for the as a company we have been for the as a company we have been working in this area for the past few working in this area for the past few working in this area for the past few years and uh we have in identifying some years and uh we have in identifying some years and uh we have in identifying some pain points that that all of us are pain points that that all of us are pain points that that all of us are recognizing and and working towards but recognizing and and working towards but recognizing and and working towards but then we also talk about some of the then we also talk about some of the then we also talk about some of the hidden fears that are there that are not hidden fears that are there that are not hidden fears that are there that are not necessarily visible yet and what could necessarily visible yet and what could necessarily visible yet and what could they be and what uh what are the things they be and what uh what are the things they be and what uh what are the things that we are doing right now and what that we are doing right now and what that we are doing right now and what we'll be doing in future that's some of we'll be doing in future that's some of we'll be doing in future that's some of the stuff that I want to capture so one the stuff that I want to capture so one the stuff that I want to capture so one of the things is uh that uh we have all of the things is uh that uh we have all of the things is uh that uh we have all realized that most of our software isn't realized that most of our software isn't realized that most of our software isn't ours uh we build on tons of open source ours uh we build on tons of open source ours uh we build on tons of open source code and we therefore transitively code and we therefore transitively code and we therefore transitively consume the risk that is coming from all consume the risk that is coming from all consume the risk that is coming from all the open source code u that is the open source code u that is the open source code u that is underneath underneath underneath us. us. us. Okay. Yes. So I was using PDFs and that Okay. Yes. So I was using PDFs and that Okay. Yes. So I was using PDFs and that might create some transitional issues might create some transitional issues might create some transitional issues but I I'll I'll go ahead with that. So but I I'll I'll go ahead with that. So but I I'll I'll go ahead with that. So we all understand this as well. These we all understand this as well. These we all understand this as well. These are very boring slides. Uh we all know are very boring slides. Uh we all know are very boring slides. Uh we all know that there's like 74% of code bases they that there's like 74% of code bases they that there's like 74% of code bases they harbor high risk open source harbor high risk open source harbor high risk open source vulnerabilities. it's it's all around vulnerabilities. it's it's all around vulnerabilities. it's it's all around us. It's it's problematic and it's us. It's it's problematic and it's us. It's it's problematic and it's hardly exciting. So what I wanted to do hardly exciting. So what I wanted to do hardly exciting. So what I wanted to do is I just want to follow the pad and is I just want to follow the pad and is I just want to follow the pad and wanted to uh get a cool representation wanted to uh get a cool representation wanted to uh get a cool representation of what is the problem that open source of what is the problem that open source of what is the problem that open source uh gives us. So I asked uh like went uh gives us. So I asked uh like went uh gives us. So I asked uh like went through several repetitions. This is through several repetitions. This is through several repetitions. This is something that most of the present something that most of the present something that most of the present presenters have been doing these days presenters have been doing these days presenters have been doing these days like all of us have become our like new like all of us have become our like new like all of us have become our like new graphic artists where we just like have graphic artists where we just like have graphic artists where we just like have some access to some Sora Gemini whatever some access to some Sora Gemini whatever some access to some Sora Gemini whatever and we try to build images. These are and we try to build images. These are and we try to build images. These are great because we hold the copyright so great because we hold the copyright so great because we hold the copyright so we can share those um and and so on. But we can share those um and and so on. But we can share those um and and so on. But I I I was trying to understand like uh I I I was trying to understand like uh I I I was trying to understand like uh so what what are the open-source supply so what what are the open-source supply so what what are the open-source supply chain dependency looks like? So I was uh chain dependency looks like? So I was uh chain dependency looks like? So I was uh prompting the AI uh that we were that prompting the AI uh that we were that prompting the AI uh that we were that I'm interested in open source I'm interested in open source I'm interested in open source dependencies and the risk that are that dependencies and the risk that are that dependencies and the risk that are that the open source dependencies they create the open source dependencies they create the open source dependencies they create a backdoor for us and risks come uh so a backdoor for us and risks come uh so a backdoor for us and risks come uh so this is the image that I got any this is the image that I got any this is the image that I got any comments on like what what could be like comments on like what what could be like comments on like what what could be like problematic here like I mean it just problematic here like I mean it just problematic here like I mean it just tells you number one that AI is great tells you number one that AI is great tells you number one that AI is great but it does not necessarily capture what but it does not necessarily capture what but it does not necessarily capture what you want all all the time. Like for you want all all the time. Like for you want all all the time. Like for example here, like instead of the back example here, like instead of the back example here, like instead of the back door, it looks like a front door, but door, it looks like a front door, but door, it looks like a front door, but yeah, it's it's coming from the back. I yeah, it's it's coming from the back. I yeah, it's it's coming from the back. I I get that. Uh at the same time, like I get that. Uh at the same time, like I get that. Uh at the same time, like there's the there's the there's the dependencies there just like on the wall dependencies there just like on the wall dependencies there just like on the wall and the open source is there. So it it and the open source is there. So it it and the open source is there. So it it it captures the thought but that that's it captures the thought but that that's it captures the thought but that that's a that's just something that I wanted to a that's just something that I wanted to a that's just something that I wanted to uh show uh show uh show because like the open source code uh because like the open source code uh because like the open source code uh that uh uh sorry so the AI fed is is that uh uh sorry so the AI fed is is that uh uh sorry so the AI fed is is going around us and and I just wanted to going around us and and I just wanted to going around us and and I just wanted to like douse in that. So let me tell a like douse in that. So let me tell a like douse in that. So let me tell a little bit about myself. little bit about myself. little bit about myself. Um I've been working in academia and the Um I've been working in academia and the Um I've been working in academia and the industry u and u now in a startup life industry u and u now in a startup life industry u and u now in a startup life uh working on uh supply chain security uh working on uh supply chain security uh working on uh supply chain security and and software uh static analysis to and and software uh static analysis to and and software uh static analysis to find bugs u in your code u I've been uh find bugs u in your code u I've been uh find bugs u in your code u I've been uh working uh so I've worked at uh coarity working uh so I've worked at uh coarity working uh so I've worked at uh coarity which is the leading bug detection which is the leading bug detection which is the leading bug detection company where uh we identifi where I led company where uh we identifi where I led company where uh we identifi where I led a team uh that released the first a team uh that released the first a team uh that released the first commercial vulnerability commercial vulnerability commercial vulnerability uh detection tool for JavaScript and uh detection tool for JavaScript and uh detection tool for JavaScript and Android um at u and before that in the Android um at u and before that in the Android um at u and before that in the academia I've looked into u automated academia I've looked into u automated academia I've looked into u automated tools for for detecting bugs u in tools for for detecting bugs u in tools for for detecting bugs u in software what all of those bring in in software what all of those bring in in software what all of those bring in in software supply chain security is we see software supply chain security is we see software supply chain security is we see that u the supply chain security has that u the supply chain security has that u the supply chain security has become a very reactive become a very reactive become a very reactive u process where uh we deal with bugs u process where uh we deal with bugs u process where uh we deal with bugs that are there in our dependencies and that are there in our dependencies and that are there in our dependencies and uh there there's a whole lot of them and uh there there's a whole lot of them and uh there there's a whole lot of them and it's a matter of uh of connecting with it's a matter of uh of connecting with it's a matter of uh of connecting with with those supply chain uh bugs and and with those supply chain uh bugs and and with those supply chain uh bugs and and find trying to find out like what can we find trying to find out like what can we find trying to find out like what can we do about this. So here are the three do about this. So here are the three do about this. So here are the three wild things that we have been wild things that we have been wild things that we have been identifying um in the supply chain risk identifying um in the supply chain risk identifying um in the supply chain risk management area and this is what what management area and this is what what management area and this is what what I'm going to talk about u in the in the I'm going to talk about u in the in the I'm going to talk about u in the in the rest of the presentation. So the first rest of the presentation. So the first rest of the presentation. So the first one is the reactive nature of the one is the reactive nature of the one is the reactive nature of the software composition analysis software composition analysis software composition analysis tools. So all of these slides were tools. So all of these slides were tools. So all of these slides were interactive. So that kind of like interactive. So that kind of like interactive. So that kind of like um is um is um is is so I I had some things planned but is so I I had some things planned but is so I I had some things planned but it's it's apparently not going to work it's it's apparently not going to work it's it's apparently not going to work out at this particular point because out at this particular point because out at this particular point because it's a it's a flat slide. Uh so the it's a it's a flat slide. Uh so the it's a it's a flat slide. Uh so the software composition analysis uh tools software composition analysis uh tools software composition analysis uh tools they are very reactive. So when you see they are very reactive. So when you see they are very reactive. So when you see a bug discovered here u so there's a CV a bug discovered here u so there's a CV a bug discovered here u so there's a CV that gets issued so the bug gets that gets issued so the bug gets that gets issued so the bug gets reported to the maintainer the reported to the maintainer the reported to the maintainer the maintainer fixes the bug a CV gets maintainer fixes the bug a CV gets maintainer fixes the bug a CV gets issued at that point the software issued at that point the software issued at that point the software composition analysis tools pick up the composition analysis tools pick up the composition analysis tools pick up the signal but what is interesting is the signal but what is interesting is the signal but what is interesting is the actual bug might have happened a long actual bug might have happened a long actual bug might have happened a long time ago and uh in cases for bugs this time ago and uh in cases for bugs this time ago and uh in cases for bugs this long time can mean a really long time u long time can mean a really long time u long time can mean a really long time u so I wanted to like test you but I mean so I wanted to like test you but I mean so I wanted to like test you but I mean the results are already here in this the results are already here in this the results are already here in this case. Uh so in in who understand or who case. Uh so in in who understand or who case. Uh so in in who understand or who can recognize what the left uh like can recognize what the left uh like can recognize what the left uh like there's a icon for that vulnerability? there's a icon for that vulnerability? there's a icon for that vulnerability? Uh that was in 2014 like anybody Uh that was in 2014 like anybody Uh that was in 2014 like anybody remembers that hardle. Yes. So hard was remembers that hardle. Yes. So hard was remembers that hardle. Yes. So hard was actually there in the code for about two actually there in the code for about two actually there in the code for about two years before it got discovered. Same uh years before it got discovered. Same uh years before it got discovered. Same uh the second one log for text for shell the second one log for text for shell the second one log for text for shell that was in the source code for about that was in the source code for about that was in the source code for about four years before it got four years before it got four years before it got discovered. In case of log for shell the discovered. In case of log for shell the discovered. In case of log for shell the actual vulnerability was a feature that actual vulnerability was a feature that actual vulnerability was a feature that was introduced in 2013 and then uh was introduced in 2013 and then uh was introduced in 2013 and then uh reported in 2021 only because somebody reported in 2021 only because somebody reported in 2021 only because somebody in Alibaba find out that there's been an in Alibaba find out that there's been an in Alibaba find out that there's been an active exploitation going on uh for that active exploitation going on uh for that active exploitation going on uh for that uh that thing. And then there's Windows uh that thing. And then there's Windows uh that thing. And then there's Windows printy one which has been there for a printy one which has been there for a printy one which has been there for a long time. Uh and it was like identified long time. Uh and it was like identified long time. Uh and it was like identified uh it was there in the source code since uh it was there in the source code since uh it was there in the source code since 1996. It was eventually fixed in 2020. 1996. It was eventually fixed in 2020. 1996. It was eventually fixed in 2020. So about 24 years uh it was there in So about 24 years uh it was there in So about 24 years uh it was there in your source code. So for the log for your source code. So for the log for your source code. So for the log for shell specifically we don't know how shell specifically we don't know how shell specifically we don't know how many times or whether the vulnerability many times or whether the vulnerability many times or whether the vulnerability was exploited in those eight years where was exploited in those eight years where was exploited in those eight years where the vulnerability where the bug was the vulnerability where the bug was the vulnerability where the bug was latent in the source code. So that's the latent in the source code. So that's the latent in the source code. So that's the main problem that the actual bug that we main problem that the actual bug that we main problem that the actual bug that we are worried about right now. That's the are worried about right now. That's the are worried about right now. That's the bug that has already happened. We know bug that has already happened. We know bug that has already happened. We know about it. Yes, we have to deal with it. about it. Yes, we have to deal with it. about it. Yes, we have to deal with it. But there may be also a lot of latent But there may be also a lot of latent But there may be also a lot of latent stuff that is going on in your code that stuff that is going on in your code that stuff that is going on in your code that has been there. So what if we have an approach where we So what if we have an approach where we So what if we have an approach where we proactively look for the for your in proactively look for the for your in proactively look for the for your in your supply chain and look for those your supply chain and look for those your supply chain and look for those vulnerabilities in in in those supply vulnerabilities in in in those supply vulnerabilities in in in those supply chain to supply chain artifacts in the chain to supply chain artifacts in the chain to supply chain artifacts in the first place and some of these bugs that first place and some of these bugs that first place and some of these bugs that we find they become vulnerabilities and we find they become vulnerabilities and we find they become vulnerabilities and then eventually the the SA tools pick up then eventually the the SA tools pick up then eventually the the SA tools pick up the signals but the time that we gain the signals but the time that we gain the signals but the time that we gain between here and there could be years between here and there could be years between here and there could be years because uh like if you go ahead and because uh like if you go ahead and because uh like if you go ahead and proactively uh look for the proactively uh look for the proactively uh look for the vulnerabilities but then the question is vulnerabilities but then the question is vulnerabilities but then the question is how do we look for that? As an industry how do we look for that? As an industry how do we look for that? As an industry we struggle looking for bugs in our we struggle looking for bugs in our we struggle looking for bugs in our proprietary code with static analysis proprietary code with static analysis proprietary code with static analysis tools or dynamic analysis tools in the tools or dynamic analysis tools in the tools or dynamic analysis tools in the first place and now we're talking about first place and now we're talking about first place and now we're talking about a thousand dependencies underneath as a thousand dependencies underneath as a thousand dependencies underneath as well. So that's something that we wanted well. So that's something that we wanted well. So that's something that we wanted to do. It was an ambitious project that to do. It was an ambitious project that to do. It was an ambitious project that we wanted to do. U and this is where we wanted to do. U and this is where we wanted to do. U and this is where Alpha Omega came and they funded us u to Alpha Omega came and they funded us u to Alpha Omega came and they funded us u to uh to look into the top projects um and uh to look into the top projects um and uh to look into the top projects um and we looked into the top 2,000 Python we looked into the top 2,000 Python we looked into the top 2,000 Python projects and their dependencies um and projects and their dependencies um and projects and their dependencies um and try to find whatever we can find try to find whatever we can find try to find whatever we can find there. So here's a scorecard uh of that there. So here's a scorecard uh of that there. So here's a scorecard uh of that bath finding bath finding bath finding activity. So in about 2,000 projects in activity. So in about 2,000 projects in activity. So in about 2,000 projects in Pippi uh the top 2,000 projects this is Pippi uh the top 2,000 projects this is Pippi uh the top 2,000 projects this is based on the number of downloads from based on the number of downloads from based on the number of downloads from the PPI repository in the last one year the PPI repository in the last one year the PPI repository in the last one year um top 2,000 projects and their um top 2,000 projects and their um top 2,000 projects and their dependencies there's about 14,000 of dependencies there's about 14,000 of dependencies there's about 14,000 of them uh we identified about 350 bugs them uh we identified about 350 bugs them uh we identified about 350 bugs about 150 security bugs 55 of them high about 150 security bugs 55 of them high about 150 security bugs 55 of them high severity security bugs and then all the severity security bugs and then all the severity security bugs and then all the bugs that we have reported uh right now bugs that we have reported uh right now bugs that we have reported uh right now I think about 65% have been fixed so I think about 65% have been fixed so I think about 65% have been fixed so it's a it's an ongoing process and so it's a it's an ongoing process and so it's a it's an ongoing process and so on. Um what also we have done is we have on. Um what also we have done is we have on. Um what also we have done is we have demonstrated the capability that we can demonstrated the capability that we can demonstrated the capability that we can not only look at your supply chain not only look at your supply chain not only look at your supply chain dependencies and find previously dependencies and find previously dependencies and find previously undiscovered bugs but we can do that at undiscovered bugs but we can do that at undiscovered bugs but we can do that at scale as well. Uh right now we can scan scale as well. Uh right now we can scan scale as well. Uh right now we can scan about 1500 packages and provide you a about 1500 packages and provide you a about 1500 packages and provide you a data feed about previously undetected data feed about previously undetected data feed about previously undetected bugs in your supply chain dependencies bugs in your supply chain dependencies bugs in your supply chain dependencies at scale. So there's been some previous work So there's been some previous work So there's been some previous work that's done on u on doing these buck that's done on u on doing these buck that's done on u on doing these buck finding u in your supply chain finding u in your supply chain finding u in your supply chain dependencies or in open source code in dependencies or in open source code in dependencies or in open source code in general and reporting at scale but most general and reporting at scale but most general and reporting at scale but most of them uh like had a similar approach of them uh like had a similar approach of them uh like had a similar approach where there's a single kind of bug that where there's a single kind of bug that where there's a single kind of bug that is applicable to many different kinds is applicable to many different kinds is applicable to many different kinds of kinds of applications that is there of kinds of applications that is there of kinds of applications that is there in any applications and you can find in any applications and you can find in any applications and you can find that single bug and look for instances that single bug and look for instances that single bug and look for instances of that in GitHub, find that and then of that in GitHub, find that and then of that in GitHub, find that and then report everywhere what is what we call a report everywhere what is what we call a report everywhere what is what we call a bulk pull request uh that you generate bulk pull request uh that you generate bulk pull request uh that you generate everywhere and ask everybody to fix everywhere and ask everybody to fix everywhere and ask everybody to fix that. So in 2019 to 2021 my friend that. So in 2019 to 2021 my friend that. So in 2019 to 2021 my friend Jonathan Lechu who is around here um he Jonathan Lechu who is around here um he Jonathan Lechu who is around here um he uh did some u basically this bul pull uh did some u basically this bul pull uh did some u basically this bul pull request generation and we had he had request generation and we had he had request generation and we had he had some few campaigns about reporting this some few campaigns about reporting this some few campaigns about reporting this to uh many GitHub to uh many GitHub to uh many GitHub repositories and and then uh then fixed repositories and and then uh then fixed repositories and and then uh then fixed a few of of uh fix the same instance of a few of of uh fix the same instance of a few of of uh fix the same instance of that bug across the uh community and or that bug across the uh community and or that bug across the uh community and or attempted to do that. Um in 2022 the attempted to do that. Um in 2022 the attempted to do that. Um in 2022 the researchers from Trellis took it to a researchers from Trellis took it to a researchers from Trellis took it to a different level. They fixed uh they different level. They fixed uh they different level. They fixed uh they attempted to create 61,000 patches uh to attempted to create 61,000 patches uh to attempted to create 61,000 patches uh to fix a CVE that was from 2007 by the way fix a CVE that was from 2007 by the way fix a CVE that was from 2007 by the way but still not uh not fixed in 2022 and but still not uh not fixed in 2022 and but still not uh not fixed in 2022 and it created a lot of press and so on but it created a lot of press and so on but it created a lot of press and so on but it also created a lot of anger from the it also created a lot of anger from the it also created a lot of anger from the maintainers. U so from the maintainers maintainers. U so from the maintainers maintainers. U so from the maintainers perspective this is this is very real. perspective this is this is very real. perspective this is this is very real. This is a um uh this is an image that I This is a um uh this is an image that I This is a um uh this is an image that I am stealing from Vincent Dan's am stealing from Vincent Dan's am stealing from Vincent Dan's presentation u that he has done on vex presentation u that he has done on vex presentation u that he has done on vex and and stuff and and stuff and and stuff where we there's a fundamental where we there's a fundamental where we there's a fundamental disconnect between the security disconnect between the security disconnect between the security researchers and the um and the open researchers and the um and the open researchers and the um and the open source maintainers where the open source source maintainers where the open source source maintainers where the open source maintainers get overwhelmed by uh by the maintainers get overwhelmed by uh by the maintainers get overwhelmed by uh by the uh lack of empathy from security uh lack of empathy from security uh lack of empathy from security researchers because they just like researchers because they just like researchers because they just like report a bug and they go go away and not report a bug and they go go away and not report a bug and they go go away and not necessarily so all the time understand necessarily so all the time understand necessarily so all the time understand the they understand the context under the they understand the context under the they understand the context under which the bug applies and and therefore which the bug applies and and therefore which the bug applies and and therefore the bug may not be real. Uh but this the bug may not be real. Uh but this the bug may not be real. Uh but this this just creates a lot of work and the this just creates a lot of work and the this just creates a lot of work and the poor open source maintainer they get uh poor open source maintainer they get uh poor open source maintainer they get uh the the love that is coming from open the the love that is coming from open the the love that is coming from open source from the security uh researchers source from the security uh researchers source from the security uh researchers doesn't necessarily translate to the doesn't necessarily translate to the doesn't necessarily translate to the other side and that's very real. I I other side and that's very real. I I other side and that's very real. I I hear about these things um a lot when I hear about these things um a lot when I hear about these things um a lot when I speak with open source maintainers. Um speak with open source maintainers. Um speak with open source maintainers. Um so what we wanted to do is wanted to so what we wanted to do is wanted to so what we wanted to do is wanted to remove from that and and try to do remove from that and and try to do remove from that and and try to do something that is more humane and work something that is more humane and work something that is more humane and work for both sides. So one of the things was for both sides. So one of the things was for both sides. So one of the things was like coming from not a handle that is like coming from not a handle that is like coming from not a handle that is not human but coming from an actual so not human but coming from an actual so not human but coming from an actual so the reporting is done from an actual the reporting is done from an actual the reporting is done from an actual human handle and that human handle is human handle and that human handle is human handle and that human handle is also there for back and forth also there for back and forth also there for back and forth communication after the bug. So just communication after the bug. So just communication after the bug. So just reporting there and going away that's reporting there and going away that's reporting there and going away that's the classic drive by PR u and that's not the classic drive by PR u and that's not the classic drive by PR u and that's not something that works. So one of the something that works. So one of the something that works. So one of the things that we have done is uh while we things that we have done is uh while we things that we have done is uh while we are reporting the bugs and finding new are reporting the bugs and finding new are reporting the bugs and finding new bugs, we are also working with the bugs, we are also working with the bugs, we are also working with the maintainers very closely in order to fix maintainers very closely in order to fix maintainers very closely in order to fix the problem and and help them even uh the problem and and help them even uh the problem and and help them even uh write the exploit code to demonstrate write the exploit code to demonstrate write the exploit code to demonstrate the the realism that the bug is real and the the realism that the bug is real and the the realism that the bug is real and it's impactful uh to create fixes with it's impactful uh to create fixes with it's impactful uh to create fixes with them for them on their behalf. So all of them for them on their behalf. So all of them for them on their behalf. So all of this created a created that high this created a created that high this created a created that high adoption rate that I was mentioning. adoption rate that I was mentioning. adoption rate that I was mentioning. That's about like all the bugs that we That's about like all the bugs that we That's about like all the bugs that we have reported about 65% of them already have reported about 65% of them already have reported about 65% of them already been fixed and and been fixed and and been fixed and and counting. So here's an example of a path counting. So here's an example of a path counting. So here's an example of a path manipulation in open ss open mss. In manipulation in open ss open mss. In manipulation in open ss open mss. In this case we uh created a patch and we this case we uh created a patch and we this case we uh created a patch and we uh and and this was accepted. Uh this is uh and and this was accepted. Uh this is uh and and this was accepted. Uh this is a sensitive data leak in Anaconda. again a sensitive data leak in Anaconda. again a sensitive data leak in Anaconda. again uh I think this in this case they uh I think this in this case they uh I think this in this case they created the patch but uh but again like created the patch but uh but again like created the patch but uh but again like we had back and forth communications we had back and forth communications we had back and forth communications with them. There's a cross-hat scripting with them. There's a cross-hat scripting with them. There's a cross-hat scripting that was averted in Red Hat's code. Uh that was averted in Red Hat's code. Uh that was averted in Red Hat's code. Uh there's a data race in Kubernetes code. there's a data race in Kubernetes code. there's a data race in Kubernetes code. Uh what is interesting here is there's a Uh what is interesting here is there's a Uh what is interesting here is there's a lot of bugs. There's no point going lot of bugs. There's no point going lot of bugs. There's no point going through each one of the bugs. Uh but through each one of the bugs. Uh but through each one of the bugs. Uh but what is interest uh what uh what is what is interest uh what uh what is what is interest uh what uh what is interesting here is to look at the interesting here is to look at the interesting here is to look at the overall aspects. Like one of the overall aspects. Like one of the overall aspects. Like one of the questions that we have is uh did we find questions that we have is uh did we find questions that we have is uh did we find more interesting bugs compared to other more interesting bugs compared to other more interesting bugs compared to other uh solutions like if we had applied uh solutions like if we had applied uh solutions like if we had applied others and why why aren't others also others and why why aren't others also others and why why aren't others also applying this technology and and looking applying this technology and and looking applying this technology and and looking for bugs in your in like hundreds of for bugs in your in like hundreds of for bugs in your in like hundreds of hundreds of thousands of your supply hundreds of thousands of your supply hundreds of thousands of your supply chain dependencies. One problem is the chain dependencies. One problem is the chain dependencies. One problem is the static analysis tools they have been uh static analysis tools they have been uh static analysis tools they have been uh very like they're they're full of false very like they're they're full of false very like they're they're full of false positives. So their their reports are positives. So their their reports are positives. So their their reports are full of false positives. So because of full of false positives. So because of full of false positives. So because of that u you struggle when when you are that u you struggle when when you are that u you struggle when when you are consuming the static analysis report consuming the static analysis report consuming the static analysis report even for your proprietary tool. Now even for your proprietary tool. Now even for your proprietary tool. Now multiply that by a thousand for your multiply that by a thousand for your multiply that by a thousand for your thousand dependencies. It just becomes thousand dependencies. It just becomes thousand dependencies. It just becomes untenable for people to look uh for look untenable for people to look uh for look untenable for people to look uh for look for uh bugs using static analysis tools. for uh bugs using static analysis tools. for uh bugs using static analysis tools. So here's an example of that. So we So here's an example of that. So we So here's an example of that. So we looked into Kubernetes. Everybody knows looked into Kubernetes. Everybody knows looked into Kubernetes. Everybody knows Kubernetes. Uh we compared like five Kubernetes. Uh we compared like five Kubernetes. Uh we compared like five different static analysis tools. We different static analysis tools. We different static analysis tools. We wanted to find out uh what our approach wanted to find out uh what our approach wanted to find out uh what our approach which is ICR intelligent code repair at which is ICR intelligent code repair at which is ICR intelligent code repair at the top. uh they they found what kind of the top. uh they they found what kind of the top. uh they they found what kind of bugs they find in in Kubernetes, how bugs they find in in Kubernetes, how bugs they find in in Kubernetes, how many of them were true positive, how many of them were true positive, how many of them were true positive, how many of them were false positives u and many of them were false positives u and many of them were false positives u and also we looked at a specific Kubernetes also we looked at a specific Kubernetes also we looked at a specific Kubernetes version which had a seeded bug in that version which had a seeded bug in that version which had a seeded bug in that like a known bug in in that. So we were like a known bug in in that. So we were like a known bug in in that. So we were also interested in whether that tool also interested in whether that tool also interested in whether that tool finds that bug or not. And in this case finds that bug or not. And in this case finds that bug or not. And in this case we uh we found that like we compared it we uh we found that like we compared it we uh we found that like we compared it with codeql, sam grab, sneak and son with codeql, sam grab, sneak and son with codeql, sam grab, sneak and son cloud. Uh none of those tools were able cloud. Uh none of those tools were able cloud. Uh none of those tools were able to find that seeded bug there. Uh but at to find that seeded bug there. Uh but at to find that seeded bug there. Uh but at the same time they're generating tons of the same time they're generating tons of the same time they're generating tons of false positive like in occasionally false positive like in occasionally false positive like in occasionally there were like 16,244 reports and all there were like 16,244 reports and all there were like 16,244 reports and all of them were false positives. uh like of them were false positives. uh like of them were false positives. uh like doing that with uh with u like using doing that with uh with u like using doing that with uh with u like using that kind of uh like results for a bulk that kind of uh like results for a bulk that kind of uh like results for a bulk or a scalability problem. It just does or a scalability problem. It just does or a scalability problem. It just does not work. uh but what the uh intelligent not work. uh but what the uh intelligent not work. uh but what the uh intelligent code repair and and its uh lack of false code repair and and its uh lack of false code repair and and its uh lack of false positives what it allowed us is to look positives what it allowed us is to look positives what it allowed us is to look at these at scale and also had time uh at these at scale and also had time uh at these at scale and also had time uh to help with the PRs to help with to help with the PRs to help with to help with the PRs to help with creating the PC exploit codes and creating the PC exploit codes and creating the PC exploit codes and following the norms in um in general following the norms in um in general following the norms in um in general like one of the issues of bulk like one of the issues of bulk like one of the issues of bulk generation was when you submit a PR you generation was when you submit a PR you generation was when you submit a PR you have to also sign u you have to like do have to also sign u you have to like do have to also sign u you have to like do some sign off and and that's something some sign off and and that's something some sign off and and that's something that the researchers did not a that the researchers did not a that the researchers did not a researcher who's like submitting 62 thou researcher who's like submitting 62 thou researcher who's like submitting 62 thou thousand reports uh they're not doing thousand reports uh they're not doing thousand reports uh they're not doing and and that just creates a lot of and and that just creates a lot of and and that just creates a lot of problem uh or a lot of noise uh in this problem uh or a lot of noise uh in this problem uh or a lot of noise uh in this particular case so this is a slide that particular case so this is a slide that particular case so this is a slide that I stole from Michael Windsor of Alpha I stole from Michael Windsor of Alpha I stole from Michael Windsor of Alpha Omega uh this is this was his charact Omega uh this is this was his charact Omega uh this is this was his charact all of this was good like we were all of this was good like we were all of this was good like we were finding bugs it's it's okay but what is finding bugs it's it's okay but what is finding bugs it's it's okay but what is the impact of that um the impact of that um the impact of that um and so one of and so one of and so one of uh the ways that uh that he looked at uh the ways that uh that he looked at uh the ways that uh that he looked at things or or we looked at things uh is things or or we looked at things uh is things or or we looked at things uh is like we were we were like a tug board like we were we were like a tug board like we were we were like a tug board that went into the Pacific garbage patch that went into the Pacific garbage patch that went into the Pacific garbage patch and just found a lot of garbage and just and just found a lot of garbage and just and just found a lot of garbage and just brought in here. So we looked into top brought in here. So we looked into top brought in here. So we looked into top 2000 found a bunch of bugs big deal. How 2000 found a bunch of bugs big deal. How 2000 found a bunch of bugs big deal. How does it impact me? Uh but the Pacific does it impact me? Uh but the Pacific does it impact me? Uh but the Pacific garbage patch is huge. It's like one garbage patch is huge. It's like one garbage patch is huge. It's like one fifth of the size of the United States. fifth of the size of the United States. fifth of the size of the United States. Having a tugboat, a simple single Having a tugboat, a simple single Having a tugboat, a simple single tugboat like us go and try to find any tugboat like us go and try to find any tugboat like us go and try to find any amount of garbage from there is also not amount of garbage from there is also not amount of garbage from there is also not going to be possible. So what what can going to be possible. So what what can going to be possible. So what what can we do with that? So that's when the idea we do with that? So that's when the idea we do with that? So that's when the idea of the project clean beach was formed. of the project clean beach was formed. of the project clean beach was formed. So the project clean beach is using the So the project clean beach is using the So the project clean beach is using the metaphor that open-source software just metaphor that open-source software just metaphor that open-source software just like your public beaches. It's messy. like your public beaches. It's messy. like your public beaches. It's messy. people just come and use and abuse, people just come and use and abuse, people just come and use and abuse, misuse. Uh so it needs some cleaning. misuse. Uh so it needs some cleaning. misuse. Uh so it needs some cleaning. But as an organization, as a downstream But as an organization, as a downstream But as an organization, as a downstream consumer, what you are interested in is consumer, what you are interested in is consumer, what you are interested in is not necessarily all the beaches in not necessarily all the beaches in not necessarily all the beaches in general, but your section of the beach. general, but your section of the beach. general, but your section of the beach. This is the underly this is the supply This is the underly this is the supply This is the underly this is the supply chain dependencies that I am depending chain dependencies that I am depending chain dependencies that I am depending on. And can I get a good intel or get a on. And can I get a good intel or get a on. And can I get a good intel or get a good good data about known good good data about known good good data about known vulnerabilities? How do we mitigate vulnerabilities? How do we mitigate vulnerabilities? How do we mitigate those vulnerabilities as well as unknown those vulnerabilities as well as unknown those vulnerabilities as well as unknown vulnerabilities in that u uh in that vulnerabilities in that u uh in that vulnerabilities in that u uh in that uh uh set of dependencies. So the uh uh set of dependencies. So the uh uh set of dependencies. So the project in beach it's a data feed uh project in beach it's a data feed uh project in beach it's a data feed uh that gets your software bill of that gets your software bill of that gets your software bill of materials and it generates a materials and it generates a materials and it generates a riskmanagement signal and the signal is riskmanagement signal and the signal is riskmanagement signal and the signal is unique from the signal that is provided unique from the signal that is provided unique from the signal that is provided by the others from from that perspective by the others from from that perspective by the others from from that perspective that we also we provide you information that we also we provide you information that we also we provide you information about known bugs uh in your supply chain about known bugs uh in your supply chain about known bugs uh in your supply chain as well as risk that is coming from as well as risk that is coming from as well as risk that is coming from human factors. But what we uniquely human factors. But what we uniquely human factors. But what we uniquely provide is is the risk that is coming provide is is the risk that is coming provide is is the risk that is coming from previously undetected bugs in your from previously undetected bugs in your from previously undetected bugs in your supply chain dependencies that may come supply chain dependencies that may come supply chain dependencies that may come and bite you sometime bite you or and bite you sometime bite you or and bite you sometime bite you or everybody else who's using that open everybody else who's using that open everybody else who's using that open source application in source application in source application in future. So that's a uh that's we we call future. So that's a uh that's we we call future. So that's a uh that's we we call it it's you can call it like software it it's you can call it like software it it's you can call it like software composition analysis plus uh we it gives composition analysis plus uh we it gives composition analysis plus uh we it gives you better incident response. um you you you better incident response. um you you you better incident response. um you you get benefit because you get ahead of get benefit because you get ahead of get benefit because you get ahead of time intel and therefore you can react time intel and therefore you can react time intel and therefore you can react to a bug uh better. Uh there's fewer to a bug uh better. Uh there's fewer to a bug uh better. Uh there's fewer bugs shipped like imagine you get this bugs shipped like imagine you get this bugs shipped like imagine you get this information and and that uh that uh fix information and and that uh that uh fix information and and that uh that uh fix of a particular vulnerability does not of a particular vulnerability does not of a particular vulnerability does not end up being in an application that is end up being in an application that is end up being in an application that is being released that saves millions of being released that saves millions of being released that saves millions of dollars. U there's also like code dollars. U there's also like code dollars. U there's also like code provenence that people are interested in provenence that people are interested in provenence that people are interested in where am I consuming code. It looks into where am I consuming code. It looks into where am I consuming code. It looks into these aspects as well. So one of the these aspects as well. So one of the these aspects as well. So one of the things that we did as a followup of that things that we did as a followup of that things that we did as a followup of that Pacific garbage patch u exploration is Pacific garbage patch u exploration is Pacific garbage patch u exploration is now look into this from this beach now look into this from this beach now look into this from this beach perspective this beach metaphor that we perspective this beach metaphor that we perspective this beach metaphor that we are looking. So we work with Apache are looking. So we work with Apache are looking. So we work with Apache Airflow and Apache Airflow and it had Airflow and Apache Airflow and it had Airflow and Apache Airflow and it had 719 dependencies. Sorry the top part of 719 dependencies. Sorry the top part of 719 dependencies. Sorry the top part of that is wrong. I've fixed that in in the that is wrong. I've fixed that in in the that is wrong. I've fixed that in in the latest version but that uh that is not latest version but that uh that is not latest version but that uh that is not uh translated here but anyway so there's uh translated here but anyway so there's uh translated here but anyway so there's 719 dependencies u in u in Apache 719 dependencies u in u in Apache 719 dependencies u in u in Apache airflow uh so we work with the airflow uh so we work with the airflow uh so we work with the maintainer of Apache airflow u and u we maintainer of Apache airflow u and u we maintainer of Apache airflow u and u we identified risky identified risky identified risky artifacts in in Apache airflow as well artifacts in in Apache airflow as well artifacts in in Apache airflow as well as also previously undetected bugs so as also previously undetected bugs so as also previously undetected bugs so there are 16 bugs it's not a lot u four there are 16 bugs it's not a lot u four there are 16 bugs it's not a lot u four high severity bugs most of them UI high severity bugs most of them UI high severity bugs most of them UI cryptography related issues. Uh they cryptography related issues. Uh they cryptography related issues. Uh they reported using uh private vulnerability reported using uh private vulnerability reported using uh private vulnerability reporting so that we're doing in a reporting so that we're doing in a reporting so that we're doing in a coordinated disclosure. Um coordinated disclosure. Um coordinated disclosure. Um and what what it did uh what it impacted and what what it did uh what it impacted and what what it did uh what it impacted was and it did not take us a lot of time was and it did not take us a lot of time was and it did not take us a lot of time like it took us a couple of months to like it took us a couple of months to like it took us a couple of months to look into 719 dependencies and uh and look into 719 dependencies and uh and look into 719 dependencies and uh and report these bugs, identify these risky report these bugs, identify these risky report these bugs, identify these risky artifacts but and there were some artifacts but and there were some artifacts but and there were some byproducts of this uh exploration. One byproducts of this uh exploration. One byproducts of this uh exploration. One of the byproducts was that we also were of the byproducts was that we also were of the byproducts was that we also were finding some dependencies that were not finding some dependencies that were not finding some dependencies that were not used. They're in the manifest or in the used. They're in the manifest or in the used. They're in the manifest or in the dependency list, but they're not dependency list, but they're not dependency list, but they're not necessarily used anymore. So, it helped necessarily used anymore. So, it helped necessarily used anymore. So, it helped remove those those things that helps in remove those those things that helps in remove those those things that helps in cleanup. But I don't want to talk more cleanup. But I don't want to talk more cleanup. But I don't want to talk more about that. There is a specific talk about that. There is a specific talk about that. There is a specific talk that is happening right after this. So, that is happening right after this. So, that is happening right after this. So, it's just a teaser for that. You can it's just a teaser for that. You can it's just a teaser for that. You can learn about that more. uh where Michael learn about that more. uh where Michael learn about that more. uh where Michael Winsor from Alpha Omega and Yar Patuk Winsor from Alpha Omega and Yar Patuk Winsor from Alpha Omega and Yar Patuk from uh from Apache Airflow they are from uh from Apache Airflow they are from uh from Apache Airflow they are talking about this specific project and talking about this specific project and talking about this specific project and what did they find in general as well as what did they find in general as well as what did they find in general as well as like what are the the challenges that like what are the the challenges that like what are the the challenges that they're u mitigating with and how they're u mitigating with and how they're u mitigating with and how they're dealing with uh with the supply they're dealing with uh with the supply they're dealing with uh with the supply chain security of Apache Airflow. So chain security of Apache Airflow. So chain security of Apache Airflow. So that's a fascinating story which uh that's a fascinating story which uh that's a fascinating story which uh which is coming next uh like I think in which is coming next uh like I think in which is coming next uh like I think in the next hour. So that is something that the next hour. So that is something that the next hour. So that is something that you should not miss. you should not miss. you should not miss. about missing. There's this question about missing. There's this question about missing. There's this question that we also get like did we miss any that we also get like did we miss any that we also get like did we miss any high severity bugs when when we found high severity bugs when when we found high severity bugs when when we found like analyze something and found some like analyze something and found some like analyze something and found some new bugs? How many of them are we new bugs? How many of them are we new bugs? How many of them are we finding or there's obviously like no way finding or there's obviously like no way finding or there's obviously like no way you can quantify false negatives as in you can quantify false negatives as in you can quantify false negatives as in like how many of them are the actual like how many of them are the actual like how many of them are the actual bugs are out there unless there's a bugs are out there unless there's a bugs are out there unless there's a benchmark but in real realistic cases benchmark but in real realistic cases benchmark but in real realistic cases did we miss high severity bugs and we did we miss high severity bugs and we did we miss high severity bugs and we asked that question ourselves u how can asked that question ourselves u how can asked that question ourselves u how can we measure that so one way of measuring we measure that so one way of measuring we measure that so one way of measuring that is even though we are looking for that is even though we are looking for that is even though we are looking for broad scale of bugs we can classify them broad scale of bugs we can classify them broad scale of bugs we can classify them as it it also like boils down to a few as it it also like boils down to a few as it it also like boils down to a few CWE we that we focus on in particular CWE we that we focus on in particular CWE we that we focus on in particular when we do our analysis we look into when we do our analysis we look into when we do our analysis we look into about 60 CWEs. So if we have re scanned about 60 CWEs. So if we have re scanned about 60 CWEs. So if we have re scanned a project we have found some uh bugs in a project we have found some uh bugs in a project we have found some uh bugs in that and in future another same bug or a that and in future another same bug or a that and in future another same bug or a vulnerability of that same CWE is vulnerability of that same CWE is vulnerability of that same CWE is reported that means that when we scan reported that means that when we scan reported that means that when we scan that we missed that particular bug and that we missed that particular bug and that we missed that particular bug and it's a general uh it's an obvious it's a general uh it's an obvious it's a general uh it's an obvious question and we could have and we built question and we could have and we built question and we could have and we built a tool in order for us to give a live a tool in order for us to give a live a tool in order for us to give a live tracker as in how How many bugs are we tracker as in how How many bugs are we tracker as in how How many bugs are we missing in the projects that we're missing in the projects that we're missing in the projects that we're already scanning? So in this case it it already scanning? So in this case it it already scanning? So in this case it it does not mean that there is there are no does not mean that there is there are no does not mean that there is there are no bugs there. What it means that since we bugs there. What it means that since we bugs there. What it means that since we have scanned and we have reported have scanned and we have reported have scanned and we have reported something no new bugs of that kind have something no new bugs of that kind have something no new bugs of that kind have been found in that particular project. been found in that particular project. been found in that particular project. And we have a very proud record to show And we have a very proud record to show And we have a very proud record to show here uh that we missed only one high here uh that we missed only one high here uh that we missed only one high severity bug in all of those like the severity bug in all of those like the severity bug in all of those like the previous 2000 and the Apache Airflow and previous 2000 and the Apache Airflow and previous 2000 and the Apache Airflow and the other projects that we are uh we are the other projects that we are uh we are the other projects that we are uh we are monitoring and there there's like monitoring and there there's like monitoring and there there's like there's this one bug in 2024. It was a there's this one bug in 2024. It was a there's this one bug in 2024. It was a cross-sight scripting and we were cross-sight scripting and we were cross-sight scripting and we were wondering like why did we miss that? And wondering like why did we miss that? And wondering like why did we miss that? And apparently it was a Python project. It apparently it was a Python project. It apparently it was a Python project. It was getting data from a request but it was getting data from a request but it was getting data from a request but it was not the request that's HTTP request. was not the request that's HTTP request. was not the request that's HTTP request. It's a custom request that they have It's a custom request that they have It's a custom request that they have built which we did not identify and built which we did not identify and built which we did not identify and therefore we were not able to follow the therefore we were not able to follow the therefore we were not able to follow the taint that is coming from external users taint that is coming from external users taint that is coming from external users but once we provided extra meta but once we provided extra meta but once we provided extra meta information about that taint being information about that taint being information about that taint being coming from that HTTP request yes we are coming from that HTTP request yes we are coming from that HTTP request yes we are able to detect that as well. So that's able to detect that as well. So that's able to detect that as well. So that's that's something that uh we are very that's something that uh we are very that's something that uh we are very proud of and and and I just want to show proud of and and and I just want to show proud of and and and I just want to show that that when we are doing the scans we that that when we are doing the scans we that that when we are doing the scans we are also providing some soft assurance are also providing some soft assurance are also providing some soft assurance that there's been it has been scanned that there's been it has been scanned that there's been it has been scanned pretty thoroughly and no new bugs of pretty thoroughly and no new bugs of pretty thoroughly and no new bugs of that those particular kinds could be that those particular kinds could be that those particular kinds could be found in the in that software um found in the in that software um found in the in that software um there. So now let's move move on to the there. So now let's move move on to the there. So now let's move move on to the second wild second wild second wild things which is the the this reactive things which is the the this reactive things which is the the this reactive nature of SCA and finding bugs that have nature of SCA and finding bugs that have nature of SCA and finding bugs that have not been found. It's a it's a great goal not been found. It's a it's a great goal not been found. It's a it's a great goal but it's something that is also not an but it's something that is also not an but it's something that is also not an immediate threat for most of us. uh like immediate threat for most of us. uh like immediate threat for most of us. uh like we are submerged with already many many we are submerged with already many many we are submerged with already many many alerts that are coming from known CVEs alerts that are coming from known CVEs alerts that are coming from known CVEs and we just don't know how to deal with and we just don't know how to deal with and we just don't know how to deal with that. So let's look into something that that. So let's look into something that that. So let's look into something that drives close uh closer to home. Yes. Yes. Yes. These are new vulnerabilities. Yes. Yes. These are new vulnerabilities. Yes. Yes. These are new vulnerabilities. Yes. Or bugs. Yes. to the speaker or those in Or bugs. Yes. to the speaker or those in Or bugs. Yes. to the speaker or those in the room uh we can't hear you if you the room uh we can't hear you if you the room uh we can't hear you if you don't have a microphone. So for the don't have a microphone. So for the don't have a microphone. So for the speaker so I will repeat the question. speaker so I will repeat the question. speaker so I will repeat the question. Yeah. So I'll repeat the question. The Yeah. So I'll repeat the question. The Yeah. So I'll repeat the question. The question was when we were finding question was when we were finding question was when we were finding unknown bugs are these bugs that we are unknown bugs are these bugs that we are unknown bugs are these bugs that we are finding with some static analysis tools finding with some static analysis tools finding with some static analysis tools and are these new bugs? The answer is and are these new bugs? The answer is and are these new bugs? The answer is yes. Uh they are uh previously yes. Uh they are uh previously yes. Uh they are uh previously undetected bugs that were not there undetected bugs that were not there undetected bugs that were not there before but now they have been found and before but now they have been found and before but now they have been found and many cases they were mitigated. many cases they were mitigated. many cases they were mitigated. But uh so coming back like what drives But uh so coming back like what drives But uh so coming back like what drives close to our problems is the current close to our problems is the current close to our problems is the current pain that we have which is the lack of pain that we have which is the lack of pain that we have which is the lack of actionable advice uh of what we do uh actionable advice uh of what we do uh actionable advice uh of what we do uh when when there is a bug that is found. when when there is a bug that is found. when when there is a bug that is found. And the second uh the the third problem And the second uh the the third problem And the second uh the the third problem which is the reachability like there's which is the reachability like there's which is the reachability like there's too many stuff and too many actionable too many stuff and too many actionable too many stuff and too many actionable advices. What do we do to minimize that? advices. What do we do to minimize that? advices. What do we do to minimize that? That's going to be the third one. But That's going to be the third one. But That's going to be the third one. But now let's talk about just in general now let's talk about just in general now let's talk about just in general what kind of actionable advice we can what kind of actionable advice we can what kind of actionable advice we can provide from this information that's provide from this information that's provide from this information that's coming. So here's another report card. coming. So here's another report card. coming. So here's another report card. Uh this is another beach cleaning Uh this is another beach cleaning Uh this is another beach cleaning exercise that we have done. Uh again exercise that we have done. Uh again exercise that we have done. Uh again also from uh from an engagement with also from uh from an engagement with also from uh from an engagement with alpha omega that uh we looked into alpha omega that uh we looked into alpha omega that uh we looked into genkins and we looked into 300 something genkins and we looked into 300 something genkins and we looked into 300 something of its dependencies. Again we wanted to of its dependencies. Again we wanted to of its dependencies. Again we wanted to find previously undetected bugs but we find previously undetected bugs but we find previously undetected bugs but we were also looking into what are the uh were also looking into what are the uh were also looking into what are the uh detected uh what are the CVEes that are detected uh what are the CVEes that are detected uh what are the CVEes that are there? How can we fi create actionable there? How can we fi create actionable there? How can we fi create actionable advice from these um for these artifacts advice from these um for these artifacts advice from these um for these artifacts that are the the dependencies of that are the the dependencies of that are the the dependencies of genkins. So specifically as far as genkins. So specifically as far as genkins. So specifically as far as unknown bugs, we found new 18 new high unknown bugs, we found new 18 new high unknown bugs, we found new 18 new high severity bugs in 12 risky and and 12 severity bugs in 12 risky and and 12 severity bugs in 12 risky and and 12 risky artifacts in Genkins that harbor risky artifacts in Genkins that harbor risky artifacts in Genkins that harbor those bugs. Uh that's two times more those bugs. Uh that's two times more those bugs. Uh that's two times more high severity unknown bugs uh than other high severity unknown bugs uh than other high severity unknown bugs uh than other static analysis tools can find. We also static analysis tools can find. We also static analysis tools can find. We also identified two times more risky identified two times more risky identified two times more risky artifacts than other stat uh SCA tools. artifacts than other stat uh SCA tools. artifacts than other stat uh SCA tools. So whatever the SCA tools identify as So whatever the SCA tools identify as So whatever the SCA tools identify as risky artifacts in Genkins, risky artifacts in Genkins, risky artifacts in Genkins, uh we found there's about nine artifacts uh we found there's about nine artifacts uh we found there's about nine artifacts that like if you go ahead and in Genkins that like if you go ahead and in Genkins that like if you go ahead and in Genkins it it identifies those as risky it it identifies those as risky it it identifies those as risky artifacts. We found 12 more there's one artifacts. We found 12 more there's one artifacts. We found 12 more there's one overlap. So we found two times more overlap. So we found two times more overlap. So we found two times more risky artifacts stuff that you need to risky artifacts stuff that you need to risky artifacts stuff that you need to look into uh for current problem and look into uh for current problem and look into uh for current problem and future problems. And we also provide an future problems. And we also provide an future problems. And we also provide an actionable advice in following another actionable advice in following another actionable advice in following another uh following some framework that we have uh following some framework that we have uh following some framework that we have created again through our work with created again through our work with created again through our work with alpha omega. alpha omega. alpha omega. Uh this this is something that we call Uh this this is something that we call Uh this this is something that we call the six fs and and I'm going to come uh the six fs and and I'm going to come uh the six fs and and I'm going to come uh I'll be describing what those are soon. I'll be describing what those are soon. I'll be describing what those are soon. So again coming back to the project So again coming back to the project So again coming back to the project beach like we got from genkins uh we beach like we got from genkins uh we beach like we got from genkins uh we analyzed uh version 2.47 476 of Genkins analyzed uh version 2.47 476 of Genkins analyzed uh version 2.47 476 of Genkins there were 172 artifacts. Uh we found 61 there were 172 artifacts. Uh we found 61 there were 172 artifacts. Uh we found 61 artifacts with 88 new bugs. Of them we artifacts with 88 new bugs. Of them we artifacts with 88 new bugs. Of them we are only concentrating on the 18 high are only concentrating on the 18 high are only concentrating on the 18 high severity bugs. That's what we're going severity bugs. That's what we're going severity bugs. That's what we're going to concentrate on. But there's a few to concentrate on. But there's a few to concentrate on. But there's a few medium and low severity bugs that were medium and low severity bugs that were medium and low severity bugs that were uh also there. 107 projects uh or uh also there. 107 projects uh or uh also there. 107 projects uh or artifacts were identified as clean. artifacts were identified as clean. artifacts were identified as clean. There's no problem that we were able to There's no problem that we were able to There's no problem that we were able to find there. Four of them were not find there. Four of them were not find there. Four of them were not checked for various reasons. uh but what checked for various reasons. uh but what checked for various reasons. uh but what we'll concentrate on right now is the 12 we'll concentrate on right now is the 12 we'll concentrate on right now is the 12 artifacts with the 18 high severity bugs artifacts with the 18 high severity bugs artifacts with the 18 high severity bugs that we have found in them and and the that we have found in them and and the that we have found in them and and the effort that that is needed in order to effort that that is needed in order to effort that that is needed in order to mitigate those mitigate those mitigate those bugs. So in order to mitigate those bugs bugs. So in order to mitigate those bugs bugs. So in order to mitigate those bugs we are categorizing them under six we are categorizing them under six we are categorizing them under six different actions that you can take different actions that you can take different actions that you can take which we call the six Fs. Um one of them which we call the six Fs. Um one of them which we call the six Fs. Um one of them is fix you which requires moderate is fix you which requires moderate is fix you which requires moderate effort. you basically upgrade to a newer effort. you basically upgrade to a newer effort. you basically upgrade to a newer version. Uh so there is a bug that is in version. Uh so there is a bug that is in version. Uh so there is a bug that is in a direct or an indirect dependency in a direct or an indirect dependency in a direct or an indirect dependency in your supply chain. Um but the bug that your supply chain. Um but the bug that your supply chain. Um but the bug that has been found this this has already has been found this this has already has been found this this has already been fixed in a newer release. It's just been fixed in a newer release. It's just been fixed in a newer release. It's just that there were no previous CVS or etc that there were no previous CVS or etc that there were no previous CVS or etc that was there before. So that would that was there before. So that would that was there before. So that would have prompted you from mo making that have prompted you from mo making that have prompted you from mo making that switch. Now that that information is switch. Now that that information is switch. Now that that information is available, you can do that switch uh at available, you can do that switch uh at available, you can do that switch uh at uh for the direct dependency or the uh for the direct dependency or the uh for the direct dependency or the indirect dependency and then you upgrade indirect dependency and then you upgrade indirect dependency and then you upgrade to a newer version. That's fixing your to a newer version. That's fixing your to a newer version. That's fixing your supply chain dependency directly. It supply chain dependency directly. It supply chain dependency directly. It requires moderate amount of effort but requires moderate amount of effort but requires moderate amount of effort but it's not the hardest thing to do. it's not the hardest thing to do. it's not the hardest thing to do. Um there's another thing that you can do Um there's another thing that you can do Um there's another thing that you can do is flip where that particular package is flip where that particular package is flip where that particular package has no fixes or it has become riddled has no fixes or it has become riddled has no fixes or it has become riddled with uh with problems. So therefore you with uh with problems. So therefore you with uh with problems. So therefore you might require uh moving to a different might require uh moving to a different might require uh moving to a different package. So find an equivalent package package. So find an equivalent package package. So find an equivalent package that provides you uh information provide that provides you uh information provide that provides you uh information provide you similar kind of functionality and you similar kind of functionality and you similar kind of functionality and you flip which which is more pain but you flip which which is more pain but you flip which which is more pain but nevertheless um it it gives you a way to nevertheless um it it gives you a way to nevertheless um it it gives you a way to to deal with the uh with the supply to deal with the uh with the supply to deal with the uh with the supply chain issues. There's also like when chain issues. There's also like when chain issues. There's also like when there is a problem in your supply chain there is a problem in your supply chain there is a problem in your supply chain but there are no fixes that are but there are no fixes that are but there are no fixes that are available. So in that case you have to available. So in that case you have to available. So in that case you have to work with the open source maintainers to work with the open source maintainers to work with the open source maintainers to get that fix available and then a new get that fix available and then a new get that fix available and then a new release is done and then you can move to release is done and then you can move to release is done and then you can move to that. That's a high amount of effort that. That's a high amount of effort that. That's a high amount of effort that is required. This is what we call that is required. This is what we call that is required. This is what we call forge. You forge a relationship with the forge. You forge a relationship with the forge. You forge a relationship with the uh community and you uh you go back and uh community and you uh you go back and uh community and you uh you go back and contribute to uh to their uh to the open contribute to uh to their uh to the open contribute to uh to their uh to the open source project. Eventually it gets uh it source project. Eventually it gets uh it source project. Eventually it gets uh it comes back and helps you as well. Uh you comes back and helps you as well. Uh you comes back and helps you as well. Uh you can also do fork like okay uh instead of can also do fork like okay uh instead of can also do fork like okay uh instead of uh going and and trying to fix there uh going and and trying to fix there uh going and and trying to fix there create a p private fork and just hope create a p private fork and just hope create a p private fork and just hope that this gets fixed uh upstream later that this gets fixed uh upstream later that this gets fixed uh upstream later so that you can go back to fix which is so that you can go back to fix which is so that you can go back to fix which is always a desirable thing to do um in the always a desirable thing to do um in the always a desirable thing to do um in the first place. You can also forget uh low first place. You can also forget uh low first place. You can also forget uh low or no effort is required and in many or no effort is required and in many or no effort is required and in many cases you you forget because there's no cases you you forget because there's no cases you you forget because there's no options that are available. uh but then options that are available. uh but then options that are available. uh but then there are other cases where you can like there are other cases where you can like there are other cases where you can like forego and and you abandon the package forego and and you abandon the package forego and and you abandon the package and build inhouse and then create some and build inhouse and then create some and build inhouse and then create some pro some detailed solutions uh that that pro some detailed solutions uh that that pro some detailed solutions uh that that are that require a high amount of effort are that require a high amount of effort are that require a high amount of effort but u it is sometimes necessary. So but u it is sometimes necessary. So but u it is sometimes necessary. So essentially these capture the different essentially these capture the different essentially these capture the different kinds of approaches that you might go kinds of approaches that you might go kinds of approaches that you might go ahead and do uh in order to fix the ahead and do uh in order to fix the ahead and do uh in order to fix the problems that uh you are encountering. problems that uh you are encountering. problems that uh you are encountering. So let's go back to the genkins the 18 So let's go back to the genkins the 18 So let's go back to the genkins the 18 high severity bugs and what were the high severity bugs and what were the high severity bugs and what were the different how can we categorize them different how can we categorize them different how can we categorize them under the different under the different under the different approaches. So um out of the 18 there approaches. So um out of the 18 there approaches. So um out of the 18 there were some insecure protocols. There are were some insecure protocols. There are were some insecure protocols. There are some data races which are reliability some data races which are reliability some data races which are reliability bugs not necessarily security. There's bugs not necessarily security. There's bugs not necessarily security. There's also one about insecure also one about insecure also one about insecure decentralization. There's a path decentralization. There's a path decentralization. There's a path traversal uh some weak cryptography. Um traversal uh some weak cryptography. Um traversal uh some weak cryptography. Um and I I just put some like one fire two and I I just put some like one fire two and I I just put some like one fire two fire uh to like these are all high fire uh to like these are all high fire uh to like these are all high severity bugs. Some but some of them are severity bugs. Some but some of them are severity bugs. Some but some of them are more severe than the others. Uh like the more severe than the others. Uh like the more severe than the others. Uh like the insecure dialization you can do remote insecure dialization you can do remote insecure dialization you can do remote code execution in there potentially. So code execution in there potentially. So code execution in there potentially. So that's that's more problematic than uh that's that's more problematic than uh that's that's more problematic than uh as compared to the others. Um so that's as compared to the others. Um so that's as compared to the others. Um so that's uh that's kind of a categor uh that's kind of a categor uh that's kind of a categor categorization of the 18 high severity categorization of the 18 high severity categorization of the 18 high severity bugs that are there. Now if you're bugs that are there. Now if you're bugs that are there. Now if you're looking at the 12 risky artifacts and looking at the 12 risky artifacts and looking at the 12 risky artifacts and try to categorize on how to mitigate try to categorize on how to mitigate try to categorize on how to mitigate with those bugs. uh two of those with those bugs. uh two of those with those bugs. uh two of those artifacts they are uh exposed in the artifacts they are uh exposed in the artifacts they are uh exposed in the sense that there are the the the bug sense that there are the the the bug sense that there are the the the bug that we have found there's no fix in the that we have found there's no fix in the that we have found there's no fix in the latest version. So therefore the forge latest version. So therefore the forge latest version. So therefore the forge is the option there where uh like you is the option there where uh like you is the option there where uh like you have to work with open source have to work with open source have to work with open source maintainers in order to get those uh maintainers in order to get those uh maintainers in order to get those uh things fixed. Um there's seven artifacts things fixed. Um there's seven artifacts things fixed. Um there's seven artifacts that uh what is interesting that is that that uh what is interesting that is that that uh what is interesting that is that the seven seven artifacts or about 60% the seven seven artifacts or about 60% the seven seven artifacts or about 60% of the cases of the 12 there's already a of the cases of the 12 there's already a of the cases of the 12 there's already a fix that has been done in a future fix that has been done in a future fix that has been done in a future version but it was not marked as as CV version but it was not marked as as CV version but it was not marked as as CV for whatever reason in some cases that for whatever reason in some cases that for whatever reason in some cases that code was removed so uh and new feature code was removed so uh and new feature code was removed so uh and new feature was built so therefore uh there was no was built so therefore uh there was no was built so therefore uh there was no need for for raising a CV uh So there is need for for raising a CV uh So there is need for for raising a CV uh So there is already solution available and so you already solution available and so you already solution available and so you can just move to that. So there's the can just move to that. So there's the can just move to that. So there's the five fixes uh you can just move to that five fixes uh you can just move to that five fixes uh you can just move to that uh and in some other cases there's also uh and in some other cases there's also uh and in some other cases there's also u stuff that you need need to do what uh u stuff that you need need to do what uh u stuff that you need need to do what uh you have to work with the community in you have to work with the community in you have to work with the community in order to do that. But what this gives order to do that. But what this gives order to do that. But what this gives you is it gives you some advice on what you is it gives you some advice on what you is it gives you some advice on what what you can do as well as patches that what you can do as well as patches that what you can do as well as patches that can f help you follow that particular can f help you follow that particular can f help you follow that particular route. So whenever we're providing you route. So whenever we're providing you route. So whenever we're providing you fix information like something that can fix information like something that can fix information like something that can be fixed, we're also providing you a be fixed, we're also providing you a be fixed, we're also providing you a patch that you that or a path that you patch that you that or a path that you patch that you that or a path that you can use in order to fix that dependency. can use in order to fix that dependency. can use in order to fix that dependency. Um and and and that problem would be Um and and and that problem would be Um and and and that problem would be gone. Now in some cases the artifacts gone. Now in some cases the artifacts gone. Now in some cases the artifacts are archived so you can't do really are archived so you can't do really are archived so you can't do really anything about that. Uh so fixing or anything about that. Uh so fixing or anything about that. Uh so fixing or forking are uh are the are the options forking are uh are the are the options forking are uh are the are the options there actually this should be flipping there actually this should be flipping there actually this should be flipping and forking uh that should be the action and forking uh that should be the action and forking uh that should be the action here. So here's an example of a fix. So here. So here's an example of a fix. So here. So here's an example of a fix. So if you if you have a direct dependency if you if you have a direct dependency if you if you have a direct dependency that is problematic. So here's an that is problematic. So here's an that is problematic. So here's an insecure protocol that we have found in insecure protocol that we have found in insecure protocol that we have found in org fus source jc version 111 uh and org fus source jc version 111 uh and org fus source jc version 111 uh and it's fixed in a new uh version in 2.4.1 it's fixed in a new uh version in 2.4.1 it's fixed in a new uh version in 2.4.1 it's already uh fixed so uh you can just it's already uh fixed so uh you can just it's already uh fixed so uh you can just move and this is a direct dependency so move and this is a direct dependency so move and this is a direct dependency so moving from one to another is not moving from one to another is not moving from one to another is not necessarily very problematic. Um so you necessarily very problematic. Um so you necessarily very problematic. Um so you can do that that upgrade and and that's can do that that upgrade and and that's can do that that upgrade and and that's that's an example of a fix. Uh there's that's an example of a fix. Uh there's that's an example of a fix. Uh there's another one where it can be in your uh another one where it can be in your uh another one where it can be in your uh in your indirect dependency or in your in your indirect dependency or in your in your indirect dependency or in your transitive dependency that makes it transitive dependency that makes it transitive dependency that makes it harder. Uh so here's an insecure harder. Uh so here's an insecure harder. Uh so here's an insecure dialization that happens in testNG uh dialization that happens in testNG uh dialization that happens in testNG uh version version version 6813. Uh that that's the insecure 6813. Uh that that's the insecure 6813. Uh that that's the insecure dialization that I was me mentioning. dialization that I was me mentioning. dialization that I was me mentioning. This has been fixed in new version uh in This has been fixed in new version uh in This has been fixed in new version uh in like for example the latest version is like for example the latest version is like for example the latest version is 7.10.2 uh that has this problem fixed. 7.10.2 uh that has this problem fixed. 7.10.2 uh that has this problem fixed. What is interesting is so this this What is interesting is so this this What is interesting is so this this comes from u a d so this indirect comes from u a d so this indirect comes from u a d so this indirect dependency is coming from a direct dependency is coming from a direct dependency is coming from a direct dependency from groovy uh which has also dependency from groovy uh which has also dependency from groovy uh which has also moved on and if you upgrade it through moved on and if you upgrade it through moved on and if you upgrade it through groovy you'll also get the upgrade from groovy you'll also get the upgrade from groovy you'll also get the upgrade from testNG so you do that upgrade and that testNG so you do that upgrade and that testNG so you do that upgrade and that particular problem uh should be gone uh particular problem uh should be gone uh particular problem uh should be gone uh for for your supply chain here's an for for your supply chain here's an for for your supply chain here's an example of a forge uh where there's a example of a forge uh where there's a example of a forge uh where there's a path traversal that was found uh the path traversal that was found uh the path traversal that was found uh the latest version also has that particular latest version also has that particular latest version also has that particular bug. So it has not been fixed. So you bug. So it has not been fixed. So you bug. So it has not been fixed. So you have to work with the maintainers. So we have to work with the maintainers. So we have to work with the maintainers. So we filed this and then once the fix is filed this and then once the fix is filed this and then once the fix is available, you have to work with the available, you have to work with the available, you have to work with the maintainers to get that uh that problem maintainers to get that uh that problem maintainers to get that uh that problem fixed. So these are the stuff that were fixed. So these are the stuff that were fixed. So these are the stuff that were about the unknown bugs in in the supply about the unknown bugs in in the supply about the unknown bugs in in the supply chain of Genkins. There's also the known chain of Genkins. There's also the known chain of Genkins. There's also the known bugs and uh so there's 29 high severity bugs and uh so there's 29 high severity bugs and uh so there's 29 high severity bugs that have been identified in nine bugs that have been identified in nine bugs that have been identified in nine artifacts of genkins. That's what like artifacts of genkins. That's what like artifacts of genkins. That's what like traditional tools like u sonotype or traditional tools like u sonotype or traditional tools like u sonotype or endor or others they're going to tell endor or others they're going to tell endor or others they're going to tell you. Uh and there's only one overlap you. Uh and there's only one overlap you. Uh and there's only one overlap between these risky artifacts and the between these risky artifacts and the between these risky artifacts and the ones about the unknown bugs that I was ones about the unknown bugs that I was ones about the unknown bugs that I was describing before. But nevertheless, describing before. But nevertheless, describing before. But nevertheless, these also follow into these fixing these also follow into these fixing these also follow into these fixing paradigms like the actionable advice paradigms like the actionable advice paradigms like the actionable advice paradigms where some of the many of them paradigms where some of the many of them paradigms where some of the many of them can be fixed. There's a few forge can be fixed. There's a few forge can be fixed. There's a few forge relationships, there's some fork relationships, there's some fork relationships, there's some fork relationships. But there's a recipe relationships. But there's a recipe relationships. But there's a recipe there's some actionable advice recipe there's some actionable advice recipe there's some actionable advice recipe that can be taken u in order to take uh that can be taken u in order to take uh that can be taken u in order to take uh in order to uh fix this particular in order to uh fix this particular in order to uh fix this particular supply chain dependency problems. supply chain dependency problems. supply chain dependency problems. What is also related but not necessarily What is also related but not necessarily What is also related but not necessarily described here is is another problem described here is is another problem described here is is another problem that we encounter which that we encounter which that we encounter which is when we are pre so this comes before is when we are pre so this comes before is when we are pre so this comes before ingesting the open source package u like ingesting the open source package u like ingesting the open source package u like when we have already ingested an open when we have already ingested an open when we have already ingested an open source package and there are problems source package and there are problems source package and there are problems we're managing the risk at that we're managing the risk at that we're managing the risk at that particular point but when when we are particular point but when when we are particular point but when when we are about to decide upon a new open source about to decide upon a new open source about to decide upon a new open source package is this open source package safe package is this open source package safe package is this open source package safe or not And having those kind of data u or not And having those kind of data u or not And having those kind of data u specifically about the known bugs or specifically about the known bugs or specifically about the known bugs or even unknown bugs that also can be even unknown bugs that also can be even unknown bugs that also can be useful like you can do some proactive useful like you can do some proactive useful like you can do some proactive assessment on whether this is a good assessment on whether this is a good assessment on whether this is a good package to consume in the first place. package to consume in the first place. package to consume in the first place. At the same time there are other signals At the same time there are other signals At the same time there are other signals that you can take like there are signals that you can take like there are signals that you can take like there are signals from human factors about how active that from human factors about how active that from human factors about how active that project is in general about bug uh project is in general about bug uh project is in general about bug uh detection and fixing capabilities. And detection and fixing capabilities. And detection and fixing capabilities. And so one of the things that uh that we so one of the things that uh that we so one of the things that uh that we have also uh done and we provide is so have also uh done and we provide is so have also uh done and we provide is so this is a graph of some of the this is a graph of some of the this is a graph of some of the dependencies in uh Apache Airflow uh dependencies in uh Apache Airflow uh dependencies in uh Apache Airflow uh that talks about outstanding CVEes in that talks about outstanding CVEes in that talks about outstanding CVEes in Apache Airflow um over the over the Apache Airflow um over the over the Apache Airflow um over the over the course of time and what you really want course of time and what you really want course of time and what you really want to look for is something there there's to look for is something there there's to look for is something there there's like a downward slope that you want to like a downward slope that you want to like a downward slope that you want to look for and that downward slope tells look for and that downward slope tells look for and that downward slope tells you that there's an active involvement you that there's an active involvement you that there's an active involvement about uh about bug fixing that has been about uh about bug fixing that has been about uh about bug fixing that has been going on. So that gives you some going on. So that gives you some going on. So that gives you some assurance that in future uh whenever new assurance that in future uh whenever new assurance that in future uh whenever new bugs or new CVS are going to come back bugs or new CVS are going to come back bugs or new CVS are going to come back that open source package in particular that open source package in particular that open source package in particular is going to cover your back and and help is going to cover your back and and help is going to cover your back and and help you there. So having this kind of you there. So having this kind of you there. So having this kind of information also allows you to visualize information also allows you to visualize information also allows you to visualize what is the longitudinal security effort what is the longitudinal security effort what is the longitudinal security effort that is going on in these projects that that is going on in these projects that that is going on in these projects that gives you some assurance about whether gives you some assurance about whether gives you some assurance about whether the it is okay or not risky to consume the it is okay or not risky to consume the it is okay or not risky to consume that uh that that particular artifact in that uh that that particular artifact in that uh that that particular artifact in the first place. And this kind of data the first place. And this kind of data the first place. And this kind of data it can be correlated with actual it can be correlated with actual it can be correlated with actual activities like this is something that I activities like this is something that I activities like this is something that I heard from uh from uh Yaric uh that is heard from uh from uh Yaric uh that is heard from uh from uh Yaric uh that is so this is Apache airflow uh like so this is Apache airflow uh like so this is Apache airflow uh like historically how many CVS were remaining historically how many CVS were remaining historically how many CVS were remaining and how how they were fixed and clearly and how how they were fixed and clearly and how how they were fixed and clearly there's a downward trend which is great there's a downward trend which is great there's a downward trend which is great there was an even sharper slope when there was an even sharper slope when there was an even sharper slope when there was a new security team of Apache there was a new security team of Apache there was a new security team of Apache airflow was formed so it it actually airflow was formed so it it actually airflow was formed so it it actually correlates with the real data or the correlates with the real data or the correlates with the real data or the real activities that is happening at the real activities that is happening at the real activities that is happening at the project side. So having information like project side. So having information like project side. So having information like this uh about like what what has the this uh about like what what has the this uh about like what what has the project historically been doing about project historically been doing about project historically been doing about fixing vulnerabilities that also has fixing vulnerabilities that also has fixing vulnerabilities that also has impact on good impact that can provide impact on good impact that can provide impact on good impact that can provide good intel for you when you're taking good intel for you when you're taking good intel for you when you're taking decision about ingesting a new decision about ingesting a new decision about ingesting a new u new uh open source artifact as your u new uh open source artifact as your u new uh open source artifact as your supply chain dependency. So now let's supply chain dependency. So now let's supply chain dependency. So now let's look into the reachability problem. this look into the reachability problem. this look into the reachability problem. this alert fatigue that we hear about all the alert fatigue that we hear about all the alert fatigue that we hear about all the time which is there's just too many open time which is there's just too many open time which is there's just too many open source uh too many CVEes that are being source uh too many CVEes that are being source uh too many CVEes that are being reported and the question is is that CV reported and the question is is that CV reported and the question is is that CV impacting me in the first place? Yes. Uh impacting me in the first place? Yes. Uh impacting me in the first place? Yes. Uh can I ask a quick question before you can I ask a quick question before you can I ask a quick question before you move on to the third wild thing? Those move on to the third wild thing? Those move on to the third wild thing? Those graphs that were showing the CVES on a graphs that were showing the CVES on a graphs that were showing the CVES on a downward trend. Uh where is that downward trend. Uh where is that downward trend. Uh where is that information available? Is that a a tool information available? Is that a a tool information available? Is that a a tool or a service that's provided? So we are or a service that's provided? So we are or a service that's provided? So we are providing a service called the project providing a service called the project providing a service called the project clean beach which is a data feed that clean beach which is a data feed that clean beach which is a data feed that we're providing. It's it's available we're providing. It's it's available we're providing. It's it's available through that. So it's uh it can be through that. So it's uh it can be through that. So it's uh it can be accessed through our dashboard. It can accessed through our dashboard. It can accessed through our dashboard. It can be accessed through an API but yes we're be accessed through an API but yes we're be accessed through an API but yes we're providing a data feed that uh has providing a data feed that uh has providing a data feed that uh has information like this. U so now let's information like this. U so now let's information like this. U so now let's look into this reachability problem and look into this reachability problem and look into this reachability problem and uh so this vex document generation. So uh so this vex document generation. So uh so this vex document generation. So here's a real uh supply chain case where here's a real uh supply chain case where here's a real uh supply chain case where Apache Kafka this is a downstream Apache Kafka this is a downstream Apache Kafka this is a downstream application it's using lock 4j and application it's using lock 4j and application it's using lock 4j and that's using Jackson data bind uh which that's using Jackson data bind uh which that's using Jackson data bind uh which is using snake ML and snake ML has a is using snake ML and snake ML has a is using snake ML and snake ML has a pretty colorful past regarding CVEes uh pretty colorful past regarding CVEes uh pretty colorful past regarding CVEes uh so there were there were eight CVEes and so there were there were eight CVEes and so there were there were eight CVEes and often times there's a recent discussion often times there's a recent discussion often times there's a recent discussion in Apache Kafka last year in November in Apache Kafka last year in November in Apache Kafka last year in November where okay there's been so many snake ML where okay there's been so many snake ML where okay there's been so many snake ML CVES is that impact ing us or do we need CVES is that impact ing us or do we need CVES is that impact ing us or do we need to do something about it? And if you do to do something about it? And if you do to do something about it? And if you do reachability analysis, so what we did reachability analysis, so what we did reachability analysis, so what we did was we did some manual reachability was we did some manual reachability was we did some manual reachability analysis uh that one of the core analysis uh that one of the core analysis uh that one of the core researchers that we're working with who researchers that we're working with who researchers that we're working with who is one of the PMC members of LO 4J with is one of the PMC members of LO 4J with is one of the PMC members of LO 4J with him. We we did an manual research and we him. We we did an manual research and we him. We we did an manual research and we identified like out of the eight CVEes identified like out of the eight CVEes identified like out of the eight CVEes of snakel seven reached Jackson data of snakel seven reached Jackson data of snakel seven reached Jackson data bind then zero reached log 4j and then bind then zero reached log 4j and then bind then zero reached log 4j and then zero reach kafka. So if you have that zero reach kafka. So if you have that zero reach kafka. So if you have that information that's also very valuable if information that's also very valuable if information that's also very valuable if you have that information then as Kafka you have that information then as Kafka you have that information then as Kafka you don't necessarily need to do you don't necessarily need to do you don't necessarily need to do anything about that is that etched on anything about that is that etched on anything about that is that etched on stone like there like so that's that's stone like there like so that's that's stone like there like so that's that's the vex do what what the vex document the vex do what what the vex document the vex do what what the vex document provides you but it it does not provide provides you but it it does not provide provides you but it it does not provide you like a blank check or a total you like a blank check or a total you like a blank check or a total guarantee that nothing is going to guarantee that nothing is going to guarantee that nothing is going to happen it just provides you that based happen it just provides you that based happen it just provides you that based on the evidence uh that is like let's on the evidence uh that is like let's on the evidence uh that is like let's say through reachability analysis say through reachability analysis say through reachability analysis through call graph uh the the part of through call graph uh the the part of through call graph uh the the part of the code that is vulnerable in snake ML the code that is vulnerable in snake ML the code that is vulnerable in snake ML your code which is calling snakel is your code which is calling snakel is your code which is calling snakel is just not touching that particular code just not touching that particular code just not touching that particular code so you can lay you can be safe or you so you can lay you can be safe or you so you can lay you can be safe or you can feel safe about using that can feel safe about using that can feel safe about using that particular thing so that's uh one of the particular thing so that's uh one of the particular thing so that's uh one of the things that we are looking at right now things that we are looking at right now things that we are looking at right now where we will be looking into vex where we will be looking into vex where we will be looking into vex document generation and doing that thing document generation and doing that thing document generation and doing that thing so looking at this process creating so looking at this process creating so looking at this process creating these CV uh these vex documents in each these CV uh these vex documents in each these CV uh these vex documents in each of these uh hops and providing that of these uh hops and providing that of these uh hops and providing that information. It's a massive information. It's a massive information. It's a massive decentralized effort and let's try to decentralized effort and let's try to decentralized effort and let's try to characterize that particular effort. So characterize that particular effort. So characterize that particular effort. So this is Apache solar. It has 522 this is Apache solar. It has 522 this is Apache solar. It has 522 dependencies. Uh let's assume that dependencies. Uh let's assume that dependencies. Uh let's assume that there's one dependency per artifact. I there's one dependency per artifact. I there's one dependency per artifact. I don't have the specific number but we don't have the specific number but we don't have the specific number but we have an assumption that there's about have an assumption that there's about have an assumption that there's about 300 CVES uh in Apache Solar uh in the 300 CVES uh in Apache Solar uh in the 300 CVES uh in Apache Solar uh in the dependencies of Apache Solar. Um so and dependencies of Apache Solar. Um so and dependencies of Apache Solar. Um so and on average these dependencies there's on average these dependencies there's on average these dependencies there's three hops of dependencies. So the the three hops of dependencies. So the the three hops of dependencies. So the the the chain that we were showing that the chain that we were showing that the chain that we were showing that there's three hops in that. So that there's three hops in that. So that there's three hops in that. So that means that there's 900 vex documents means that there's 900 vex documents means that there's 900 vex documents that need to be created on average that need to be created on average that need to be created on average manual analysis takes time. If it takes manual analysis takes time. If it takes manual analysis takes time. If it takes 2 hours which is pretty reasonable uh 2 hours which is pretty reasonable uh 2 hours which is pretty reasonable uh for this that this is going to take.9 for this that this is going to take.9 for this that this is going to take.9 person years. Uh for just Apache Solar's person years. Uh for just Apache Solar's person years. Uh for just Apache Solar's dependencies that's one project that's dependencies that's one project that's dependencies that's one project that's that's impossible to scale for any that's impossible to scale for any that's impossible to scale for any enterprise level where there's like enterprise level where there's like enterprise level where there's like thousands of different projects. So as a thousands of different projects. So as a thousands of different projects. So as a consequence there's low adoption of vex consequence there's low adoption of vex consequence there's low adoption of vex because the vex documents are not there because the vex documents are not there because the vex documents are not there uh not there in time also because the uh not there in time also because the uh not there in time also because the the vex documents they also have a the vex documents they also have a the vex documents they also have a timeliness factor they are very timeliness factor they are very timeliness factor they are very impactful right after the CV is there as impactful right after the CV is there as impactful right after the CV is there as time goes by people already patch the time goes by people already patch the time goes by people already patch the necessity of the vex documents go away necessity of the vex documents go away necessity of the vex documents go away but when the CV is there there's that but when the CV is there there's that but when the CV is there there's that immediate need of whether I need to do immediate need of whether I need to do immediate need of whether I need to do something at that point the vex document something at that point the vex document something at that point the vex document is is very uh it's needed And what has is is very uh it's needed And what has is is very uh it's needed And what has been also found out that if it is done been also found out that if it is done been also found out that if it is done correctly 97% of noise can be removed. correctly 97% of noise can be removed. correctly 97% of noise can be removed. So if there are 100 SCA reports 97% of So if there are 100 SCA reports 97% of So if there are 100 SCA reports 97% of them 97 of them are wrong. They don't them 97 of them are wrong. They don't them 97 of them are wrong. They don't necessarily reach you. You don't necessarily reach you. You don't necessarily reach you. You don't necessarily need to do anything about necessarily need to do anything about necessarily need to do anything about it. This is not done by us. This is done it. This is not done by us. This is done it. This is not done by us. This is done by simg I'm just quoting research from by simg I'm just quoting research from by simg I'm just quoting research from them. them. them. Uh so there's a lot of u unnecessary Uh so there's a lot of u unnecessary Uh so there's a lot of u unnecessary toil that you can remove by generating toil that you can remove by generating toil that you can remove by generating vex documents but it takes months to vex documents but it takes months to vex documents but it takes months to generate it. It is very hard. So for the generate it. It is very hard. So for the generate it. It is very hard. So for the case of Apache solar typically the open case of Apache solar typically the open case of Apache solar typically the open source maintainers they cannot do this. source maintainers they cannot do this. source maintainers they cannot do this. They just don't have the resources to do They just don't have the resources to do They just don't have the resources to do this. Apache Solar is one project where this. Apache Solar is one project where this. Apache Solar is one project where they actually tried to do it but they they actually tried to do it but they they actually tried to do it but they failed uh because like they they have failed uh because like they they have failed uh because like they they have this VEX information but that has only this VEX information but that has only this VEX information but that has only been updated you know like twice in the been updated you know like twice in the been updated you know like twice in the last 3 years. So they started doing it last 3 years. So they started doing it last 3 years. So they started doing it but they just did not have the effort or but they just did not have the effort or but they just did not have the effort or or the or the tooling behind it in order or the or the tooling behind it in order or the or the tooling behind it in order to do these things at scale. So this is to do these things at scale. So this is to do these things at scale. So this is where uh we are coming in. This is some where uh we are coming in. This is some where uh we are coming in. This is some work that we are planning in in we we're work that we are planning in in we we're work that we are planning in in we we're doing right now we have some prototypes doing right now we have some prototypes doing right now we have some prototypes going but we'll be doing soon where going but we'll be doing soon where going but we'll be doing soon where we'll be doing this reachability we'll be doing this reachability we'll be doing this reachability analysis for your supply chain analysis for your supply chain analysis for your supply chain dependencies to reduce the toil and and dependencies to reduce the toil and and dependencies to reduce the toil and and cost. This is going to eliminate a lot cost. This is going to eliminate a lot cost. This is going to eliminate a lot of the false uh uh false warnings that of the false uh uh false warnings that of the false uh uh false warnings that are there. And what we are aiming for is are there. And what we are aiming for is are there. And what we are aiming for is that whenever a CV is coming out, we can that whenever a CV is coming out, we can that whenever a CV is coming out, we can generate a vex document throughout that generate a vex document throughout that generate a vex document throughout that supply chain uh or throughout that chain supply chain uh or throughout that chain supply chain uh or throughout that chain uh within 72 hours and that provides you uh within 72 hours and that provides you uh within 72 hours and that provides you actionable intel u in order to get that actionable intel u in order to get that actionable intel u in order to get that pressing question. Do I need to do pressing question. Do I need to do pressing question. Do I need to do anything about this new CVE that has anything about this new CVE that has anything about this new CVE that has just come out? So how we are going so we just come out? So how we are going so we just come out? So how we are going so we also want to integrate with the also want to integrate with the also want to integrate with the maintainers to have this thing. So right maintainers to have this thing. So right maintainers to have this thing. So right now the delivery mechanism that we are now the delivery mechanism that we are now the delivery mechanism that we are looking at and this is this may change looking at and this is this may change looking at and this is this may change but the delivery mechanism that we're but the delivery mechanism that we're but the delivery mechanism that we're looking at is that we'll have some looking at is that we'll have some looking at is that we'll have some GitHub actions uh where whenever there's GitHub actions uh where whenever there's GitHub actions uh where whenever there's new CV alerts that are coming from new CV alerts that are coming from new CV alerts that are coming from dependabot for any of these open source dependabot for any of these open source dependabot for any of these open source projects there'll be request that is projects there'll be request that is projects there'll be request that is going to this API which is going to be going to this API which is going to be going to this API which is going to be provided by us uh for the vex document. provided by us uh for the vex document. provided by us uh for the vex document. Once the vex document is available, Once the vex document is available, Once the vex document is available, there'll be private email that will be there'll be private email that will be there'll be private email that will be disclosed. disclosed. disclosed. Uh there'll be private emails that will Uh there'll be private emails that will Uh there'll be private emails that will be sent to the maintainers to disclose be sent to the maintainers to disclose be sent to the maintainers to disclose the vulnerability. Uh and this is also the vulnerability. Uh and this is also the vulnerability. Uh and this is also something that we are um exploring like something that we are um exploring like something that we are um exploring like talking about a vex document also in in talking about a vex document also in in talking about a vex document also in in public. This might create problems. This public. This might create problems. This public. This might create problems. This might create side channel information might create side channel information might create side channel information for an attacker once a CV is has come for an attacker once a CV is has come for an attacker once a CV is has come out. And once all of these thing is out. And once all of these thing is out. And once all of these thing is done, it's been mitigated. There's some done, it's been mitigated. There's some done, it's been mitigated. There's some embargo period that is gone. At that embargo period that is gone. At that embargo period that is gone. At that point the PRs for the vex documents are point the PRs for the vex documents are point the PRs for the vex documents are are actually generated and they're are actually generated and they're are actually generated and they're available for consumption for the rest available for consumption for the rest available for consumption for the rest of the community. So what what the API of the community. So what what the API of the community. So what what the API service that we're talking about that is service that we're talking about that is service that we're talking about that is going to do is it's going to look into going to do is it's going to look into going to do is it's going to look into your CVs is going to solve one your CVs is going to solve one your CVs is going to solve one interesting but hard problem which is interesting but hard problem which is interesting but hard problem which is this uh the the the CV from the CV to this uh the the the CV from the CV to this uh the the the CV from the CV to the root cause of the problem. which the root cause of the problem. which the root cause of the problem. which part or which function in your code is part or which function in your code is part or which function in your code is the pro harbors that the root cause for the pro harbors that the root cause for the pro harbors that the root cause for that particular CVE and when you get that particular CVE and when you get that particular CVE and when you get that information you also can have the that information you also can have the that information you also can have the call graphs in this case we have our call graphs in this case we have our call graphs in this case we have our tool ICR which is a static analysis tool tool ICR which is a static analysis tool tool ICR which is a static analysis tool which generates the call graphs for this which generates the call graphs for this which generates the call graphs for this anyway so you generate the call graphs anyway so you generate the call graphs anyway so you generate the call graphs for your supply chain then you do a for your supply chain then you do a for your supply chain then you do a reachability analysis for each of the reachability analysis for each of the reachability analysis for each of the hops that are there so we look into hops that are there so we look into hops that are there so we look into let's say we have a supply chain of A to let's say we have a supply chain of A to let's say we have a supply chain of A to B to C to D and so we look into whether B to C to D and so we look into whether B to C to D and so we look into whether it is reaching B, whether it is reaching it is reaching B, whether it is reaching it is reaching B, whether it is reaching C, whether it is and eventually whether C, whether it is and eventually whether C, whether it is and eventually whether it is reaching D and we provide vex it is reaching D and we provide vex it is reaching D and we provide vex documents for each of the each steps of documents for each of the each steps of documents for each of the each steps of the way and and uh and and and do that. the way and and uh and and and do that. the way and and uh and and and do that. This is something like we have initial This is something like we have initial This is something like we have initial capability of of doing this thing but uh capability of of doing this thing but uh capability of of doing this thing but uh we are exploring more of these things in we are exploring more of these things in we are exploring more of these things in in future. in future. in future. So one interesting outcome of that that So one interesting outcome of that that So one interesting outcome of that that is immediate is we looked into that this is immediate is we looked into that this is immediate is we looked into that this particular supply chain and when we had particular supply chain and when we had particular supply chain and when we had the tooling there apparently like the the tooling there apparently like the the tooling there apparently like the tooling trumped over the manual analysis tooling trumped over the manual analysis tooling trumped over the manual analysis even though it took time but the tool even though it took time but the tool even though it took time but the tool actually proved that there's actually actually proved that there's actually actually proved that there's actually not seven CVS that are reaching data not seven CVS that are reaching data not seven CVS that are reaching data actually there's no CVs that is reaching actually there's no CVs that is reaching actually there's no CVs that is reaching there so the tool provides you like the there so the tool provides you like the there so the tool provides you like the the manual analysis that does not scale the manual analysis that does not scale the manual analysis that does not scale that's already problematic because it it that's already problematic because it it that's already problematic because it it it does not help you in your large it does not help you in your large it does not help you in your large projects but a tool can help you think projects but a tool can help you think projects but a tool can help you think or help get you to that particular point or help get you to that particular point or help get you to that particular point even faster because it can find out even faster because it can find out even faster because it can find out evidence of whether something is evidence of whether something is evidence of whether something is reachable or not in the first place. So reachable or not in the first place. So reachable or not in the first place. So this is an immediate result that uh that this is an immediate result that uh that this is an immediate result that uh that we have right now. So we are reach we have right now. So we are reach we have right now. So we are reach reaching the end. What are the key reaching the end. What are the key reaching the end. What are the key takeaways? There's one key takeaway that takeaways? There's one key takeaway that takeaways? There's one key takeaway that there are wild things in your there are wild things in your there are wild things in your dependencies and in order to uh and this dependencies and in order to uh and this dependencies and in order to uh and this is something that is not necessarily is something that is not necessarily is something that is not necessarily mine. I was talking with people in the mine. I was talking with people in the mine. I was talking with people in the last two days and trying to get feedback last two days and trying to get feedback last two days and trying to get feedback from them about like what do you think from them about like what do you think from them about like what do you think we should do as a community and uh we we should do as a community and uh we we should do as a community and uh we need to be more proactive need to be more proactive need to be more proactive uh in in uh in in uh in in finding doing something. It's it's it's finding doing something. It's it's it's finding doing something. It's it's it's a small hill that we have to climb and a small hill that we have to climb and a small hill that we have to climb and that requires some toil that would that requires some toil that would that requires some toil that would reduce further toil down the line. Uh reduce further toil down the line. Uh reduce further toil down the line. Uh like the generating these vex documents like the generating these vex documents like the generating these vex documents these do do not come for free. uh these do do not come for free. uh these do do not come for free. uh there's effort money u u that that needs there's effort money u u that that needs there's effort money u u that that needs to be spent in order to do the uh to get to be spent in order to do the uh to get to be spent in order to do the uh to get to a particular point but once we get to to a particular point but once we get to to a particular point but once we get to a particular point you can reduce a particular point you can reduce a particular point you can reduce further toil as was shown like uh for further toil as was shown like uh for further toil as was shown like uh for the eight CVEes of snake ML none of them the eight CVEes of snake ML none of them the eight CVEes of snake ML none of them reach Kafka and if Kafka people do not reach Kafka and if Kafka people do not reach Kafka and if Kafka people do not have to do anything for that that's a have to do anything for that that's a have to do anything for that that's a major saving in the in the industry we major saving in the in the industry we major saving in the in the industry we need more data and not more dashboards need more data and not more dashboards need more data and not more dashboards the data can be then used by you and uh the data can be then used by you and uh the data can be then used by you and uh and provided.
