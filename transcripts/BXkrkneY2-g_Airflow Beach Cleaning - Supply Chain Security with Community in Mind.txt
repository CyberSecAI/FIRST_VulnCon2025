Kind: captions Language: en Hi everyone. Uh, I'm Michael Windsor. Hi everyone. Uh, I'm Michael Windsor. Hi everyone. Uh, I'm Michael Windsor. Wait, that's slides. Next slide. Wait, that's slides. Next slide. Wait, that's slides. Next slide. Excellent. Uh, I'm Michael Winsor. This Excellent. Uh, I'm Michael Winsor. This Excellent. Uh, I'm Michael Winsor. This is Jarrick. Uh, we've had the pleasure is Jarrick. Uh, we've had the pleasure is Jarrick. Uh, we've had the pleasure of working together now for feels like a of working together now for feels like a of working together now for feels like a year. Feels like about a year. Um, we year. Feels like about a year. Um, we year. Feels like about a year. Um, we actually met at Pyon when I was giving a actually met at Pyon when I was giving a actually met at Pyon when I was giving a talk about some of our work at Alpha talk about some of our work at Alpha talk about some of our work at Alpha Omega. Uh, and so I start by introducing Omega. Uh, and so I start by introducing Omega. Uh, and so I start by introducing Alpha Omega. Uh, Alphome Omega is a fund Alpha Omega. Uh, Alphome Omega is a fund Alpha Omega. Uh, Alphome Omega is a fund that was co-founded by myself and that was co-founded by myself and that was co-founded by myself and Michael Skaveta right here somewhere in Michael Skaveta right here somewhere in Michael Skaveta right here somewhere in 2122 time frame. Uh, and our goal was to 2122 time frame. Uh, and our goal was to 2122 time frame. Uh, and our goal was to start turning money into security in start turning money into security in start turning money into security in open source. And our mission has evolved open source. And our mission has evolved open source. And our mission has evolved over the years. It's kind of become over the years. It's kind of become over the years. It's kind of become refined now. We've learned a lot about refined now. We've learned a lot about refined now. We've learned a lot about the problem. Uh we managed to raise the problem. Uh we managed to raise the problem. Uh we managed to raise about $23 million mo the majority of it about $23 million mo the majority of it about $23 million mo the majority of it coming from Microsoft, Amazon, and coming from Microsoft, Amazon, and coming from Microsoft, Amazon, and Google who find it in their long-term Google who find it in their long-term Google who find it in their long-term best interest that open source be more best interest that open source be more best interest that open source be more secure. Uh and so that's been a very secure. Uh and so that's been a very secure. Uh and so that's been a very productive partnership. There's a productive partnership. There's a productive partnership. There's a problem with the slides. Okay, great. While you're doing that, Okay, great. While you're doing that, Okay, great. While you're doing that, I'm gonna keep going. Yes. Perfect. I'm gonna keep going. Yes. Perfect. I'm gonna keep going. Yes. Perfect. Okay. Um originally when we sort of Okay. Um originally when we sort of Okay. Um originally when we sort of coined the name Alpha Omega and it was coined the name Alpha Omega and it was coined the name Alpha Omega and it was Michael's fault. That was brilliant. Um, Michael's fault. That was brilliant. Um, Michael's fault. That was brilliant. Um, oh, I didn't advance yet. One more oh, I didn't advance yet. One more oh, I didn't advance yet. One more time. I'm not advancing anymore. Oh, time. I'm not advancing anymore. Oh, time. I'm not advancing anymore. Oh, because because because you Okay, great. Uh, Alpha represented you Okay, great. Uh, Alpha represented you Okay, great. Uh, Alpha represented sort of the hundred most critical open sort of the hundred most critical open sort of the hundred most critical open source projects and Omega was for the source projects and Omega was for the source projects and Omega was for the long tail, the scale of everything else. long tail, the scale of everything else. long tail, the scale of everything else. As we started working in the space, we As we started working in the space, we As we started working in the space, we realized that first of all, nobody could realized that first of all, nobody could realized that first of all, nobody could agree on what the most critical projects agree on what the most critical projects agree on what the most critical projects were. Second, the ones that we should were. Second, the ones that we should were. Second, the ones that we should have could agree had lots of eyes and have could agree had lots of eyes and have could agree had lots of eyes and lots of energy and lots of attention on lots of energy and lots of attention on lots of energy and lots of attention on them. There's always work to be done, them. There's always work to be done, them. There's always work to be done, but we could pour money in there and it but we could pour money in there and it but we could pour money in there and it wouldn't necessarily make a wouldn't necessarily make a wouldn't necessarily make a difference. And we switched our approach difference. And we switched our approach difference. And we switched our approach and thought about, well, how can we have and thought about, well, how can we have and thought about, well, how can we have the most leverage? How can we do things the most leverage? How can we do things the most leverage? How can we do things that are highly leveraged activities? that are highly leveraged activities? that are highly leveraged activities? And then the omega is about the scale And then the omega is about the scale And then the omega is about the scale where we're doing things that are where we're doing things that are where we're doing things that are working to the hundreds of thousands of working to the hundreds of thousands of working to the hundreds of thousands of smaller projects where you can't just go smaller projects where you can't just go smaller projects where you can't just go off and influence them directly or have off and influence them directly or have off and influence them directly or have a conversation with them in some way. a conversation with them in some way. a conversation with them in some way. And so that really has influenced our And so that really has influenced our And so that really has influenced our approach. Um my next slide talks about approach. Um my next slide talks about approach. Um my next slide talks about that really failing on this. Give up on that. Great. Uh it influenced our that. Great. Uh it influenced our that. Great. Uh it influenced our approach a lot in terms of working with approach a lot in terms of working with approach a lot in terms of working with foundations, working with package foundations, working with package foundations, working with package ecosystems. Uh I'm giving a talk in ecosystems. Uh I'm giving a talk in ecosystems. Uh I'm giving a talk in about an hour's time in room six where I about an hour's time in room six where I about an hour's time in room six where I will go into all the gory details and will go into all the gory details and will go into all the gory details and everything we've learned along the way. everything we've learned along the way. everything we've learned along the way. So we're doing all these things and of So we're doing all these things and of So we're doing all these things and of course XZ utils happens and we all sort course XZ utils happens and we all sort course XZ utils happens and we all sort of go hm and a lot of interesting things of go hm and a lot of interesting things of go hm and a lot of interesting things came out of that uh that we were like came out of that uh that we were like came out of that uh that we were like okay maybe we're doing things wrong and okay maybe we're doing things wrong and okay maybe we're doing things wrong and one of the things was when we think one of the things was when we think one of the things was when we think about supply chain risk you know you about supply chain risk you know you about supply chain risk you know you have these things of like it's all these have these things of like it's all these have these things of like it's all these different problems like you know the different problems like you know the different problems like you know the size is not really a representation of size is not really a representation of size is not really a representation of your risk right so XC is a small little your risk right so XC is a small little your risk right so XC is a small little thing not very sort obvious attack thing not very sort obvious attack thing not very sort obvious attack vector for anything but turned out to be vector for anything but turned out to be vector for anything but turned out to be a very fragile project from a social and a very fragile project from a social and a very fragile project from a social and ecosystem point of view. Um you know and ecosystem point of view. Um you know and ecosystem point of view. Um you know and then this just really painful lesson. So then this just really painful lesson. So then this just really painful lesson. So open source people love to complain open source people love to complain open source people love to complain about how about how about how corporations bleed them dry. They use corporations bleed them dry. They use corporations bleed them dry. They use their source for free, take it without their source for free, take it without their source for free, take it without giving back, yada yada yada. Well, guess giving back, yada yada yada. Well, guess giving back, yada yada yada. Well, guess what? All the open- source projects that what? All the open- source projects that what? All the open- source projects that were dependent of exuttils were treating were dependent of exuttils were treating were dependent of exuttils were treating exuttils exactly the same way that they exuttils exactly the same way that they exuttils exactly the same way that they complained about being treated as well. complained about being treated as well. complained about being treated as well. They were treating this source code as They were treating this source code as They were treating this source code as if it was coming down from the sky on if it was coming down from the sky on if it was coming down from the sky on the back of a unicorn with rainbows the back of a unicorn with rainbows the back of a unicorn with rainbows coming out of every pore, right? And coming out of every pore, right? And coming out of every pore, right? And paying no attention to it paying no attention to it paying no attention to it whatsoever. And here's the truth. Your whatsoever. And here's the truth. Your whatsoever. And here's the truth. Your software, right, is that shiny sports software, right, is that shiny sports software, right, is that shiny sports car on car on car on top. And that's how much we're treating top. And that's how much we're treating top. And that's how much we're treating the stuff underneath it, right? It's the stuff underneath it, right? It's the stuff underneath it, right? It's your code by the way. Every ping you, your code by the way. Every ping you, your code by the way. Every ping you, every dependence you bring in, it's not every dependence you bring in, it's not every dependence you bring in, it's not their code. It's not someone else's their code. It's not someone else's their code. It's not someone else's code. It's not someone else's problem. code. It's not someone else's problem. code. It's not someone else's problem. It's your It's your It's your problem. From a compliance, from a problem. From a compliance, from a problem. From a compliance, from a security, from a correctness, from your security, from a correctness, from your security, from a correctness, from your applications, from your business, it's applications, from your business, it's applications, from your business, it's all your all your all your problem. So when we were looking at the problem. So when we were looking at the problem. So when we were looking at the scaled problem, we tried some various scaled problem, we tried some various scaled problem, we tried some various automation techniques to go off and just automation techniques to go off and just automation techniques to go off and just fix or discover, fix, and push up fix or discover, fix, and push up fix or discover, fix, and push up changes to open source projects to fix changes to open source projects to fix changes to open source projects to fix them at scale. them at scale. them at scale. And it it kind of worked, but it was a And it it kind of worked, but it was a And it it kind of worked, but it was a little frustrating because, you know, little frustrating because, you know, little frustrating because, you know, team went off and did some work and they team went off and did some work and they team went off and did some work and they came back and said, "Look, we found all came back and said, "Look, we found all came back and said, "Look, we found all these vulnerabilities and we fixed these vulnerabilities and we fixed these vulnerabilities and we fixed them." And it was like going out to the them." And it was like going out to the them." And it was like going out to the Pacific garbage patch with a rowboat and Pacific garbage patch with a rowboat and Pacific garbage patch with a rowboat and coming back with some plastic. And it coming back with some plastic. And it coming back with some plastic. And it we're like, "Well, the Pacific Architect we're like, "Well, the Pacific Architect we're like, "Well, the Pacific Architect is probably smaller than it would have is probably smaller than it would have is probably smaller than it would have been if we hadn't done that, but what been if we hadn't done that, but what been if we hadn't done that, but what can anybody do about that? Can we use can anybody do about that? Can we use can anybody do about that? Can we use that information to be more safe or more that information to be more safe or more that information to be more safe or more secure in any particular way?" And the secure in any particular way?" And the secure in any particular way?" And the answer was a a disastrous no. answer was a a disastrous no. answer was a a disastrous no. And so we came across the idea of like And so we came across the idea of like And so we came across the idea of like narrowing our focus, thinking about what narrowing our focus, thinking about what narrowing our focus, thinking about what we can do to instead of trying to pick we can do to instead of trying to pick we can do to instead of trying to pick up the whole garbage patch, which might up the whole garbage patch, which might up the whole garbage patch, which might work eventually, but it's going to take work eventually, but it's going to take work eventually, but it's going to take a hell of a long time and nobody be able a hell of a long time and nobody be able a hell of a long time and nobody be able to do anything along the way. We shifted to do anything along the way. We shifted to do anything along the way. We shifted our focus to think about what can we do our focus to think about what can we do our focus to think about what can we do to clean up one beach at a to clean up one beach at a to clean up one beach at a time. And this is where a partnership time. And this is where a partnership time. And this is where a partnership was began, right? And there are was began, right? And there are was began, right? And there are interesting characteristics about a good interesting characteristics about a good interesting characteristics about a good beach to clean up. It's one where there beach to clean up. It's one where there beach to clean up. It's one where there is a community that cares about the is a community that cares about the is a community that cares about the beach and right now they're not using beach and right now they're not using beach and right now they're not using the beach because it's dirty or they're the beach because it's dirty or they're the beach because it's dirty or they're using it and they know it's dirty but using it and they know it's dirty but using it and they know it's dirty but they're not super happy about they're not super happy about they're not super happy about that. And that. And that. And so these are the attributes, right? And so these are the attributes, right? And so these are the attributes, right? And by happy coincidence when I started by happy coincidence when I started by happy coincidence when I started talking to Eric he had all these things. talking to Eric he had all these things. talking to Eric he had all these things. I started talking about supply chain and I started talking about supply chain and I started talking about supply chain and upstream and pay dependencies. He's upstream and pay dependencies. He's upstream and pay dependencies. He's like, "Oh, I've got a list. I know all like, "Oh, I've got a list. I know all like, "Oh, I've got a list. I know all my dependencies. Here's my spreadsheet." my dependencies. Here's my spreadsheet." my dependencies. Here's my spreadsheet." Like this is great. I'm like, "Does your Like this is great. I'm like, "Does your Like this is great. I'm like, "Does your team care about culture?" He's like, team care about culture?" He's like, team care about culture?" He's like, "I'm on the head. I'm the head of the "I'm on the head. I'm the head of the "I'm on the head. I'm the head of the committee. We're driving security. It's committee. We're driving security. It's committee. We're driving security. It's becoming important. becoming important. becoming important. you know, you know, you know, and they knew what they had opportunity and they knew what they had opportunity and they knew what they had opportunity knocked. And so, Alpha Omega funded an knocked. And so, Alpha Omega funded an knocked. And so, Alpha Omega funded an audit. Instead of auditing the source audit. Instead of auditing the source audit. Instead of auditing the source code of code of code of Airflow, we asked them to go and audit Airflow, we asked them to go and audit Airflow, we asked them to go and audit 719 dependencies. Now, not to read all 719 dependencies. Now, not to read all 719 dependencies. Now, not to read all the source code, but to understand how the source code, but to understand how the source code, but to understand how those dependencies represented risk to those dependencies represented risk to those dependencies represented risk to them from a supply chain point of view. them from a supply chain point of view. them from a supply chain point of view. And so, now I'm going to hand it off to And so, now I'm going to hand it off to And so, now I'm going to hand it off to Yaric, who's done all the actual hard Yaric, who's done all the actual hard Yaric, who's done all the actual hard work. I get to just sort of sit around work. I get to just sort of sit around work. I get to just sort of sit around checks and make noise. But this is where checks and make noise. But this is where checks and make noise. But this is where thing interesting things happen. So here thing interesting things happen. So here thing interesting things happen. So here you go. Thanks Michael. So I'm the you go. Thanks Michael. So I'm the you go. Thanks Michael. So I'm the Apache Airflow maintainer and committer Apache Airflow maintainer and committer Apache Airflow maintainer and committer PMC member. Uh and let's talk about PMC member. Uh and let's talk about PMC member. Uh and let's talk about Airflow security. Who knows Airflow here Airflow security. Who knows Airflow here Airflow security. Who knows Airflow here from people who work here? Not many. So from people who work here? Not many. So from people who work here? Not many. So Airflow is a basically an orchestration Airflow is a basically an orchestration Airflow is a basically an orchestration engine and we have a lot a lot of engine and we have a lot a lot of engine and we have a lot a lot of integrations with a number of other integrations with a number of other integrations with a number of other services external services we talk to. services external services we talk to. services external services we talk to. Um, Airflow is pretty huge. If you look Um, Airflow is pretty huge. If you look Um, Airflow is pretty huge. If you look at the numbers, those are the numbers at the numbers, those are the numbers at the numbers, those are the numbers from last week. We are working on a new from last week. We are working on a new from last week. We are working on a new version of uh of Airflow release. It's version of uh of Airflow release. It's version of uh of Airflow release. It's uh like we have like 256 active pull uh like we have like 256 active pull uh like we have like 256 active pull requests in one week. Uh 62 outdoors uh requests in one week. Uh 62 outdoors uh requests in one week. Uh 62 outdoors uh uh 129 active issues uh during that uh 129 active issues uh during that uh 129 active issues uh during that week. Uh it's pretty uh pretty active week. Uh it's pretty uh pretty active week. Uh it's pretty uh pretty active project, very active project. We have we project, very active project. We have we project, very active project. We have we are used by more than 16,000 are used by more than 16,000 are used by more than 16,000 um other projects in GitHub uh or they um other projects in GitHub uh or they um other projects in GitHub uh or they are forking and and and starring us and are forking and and and starring us and are forking and and and starring us and we have more than 3,200 contributors. So we have more than 3,200 contributors. So we have more than 3,200 contributors. So we are pretty huge and this slide you we are pretty huge and this slide you we are pretty huge and this slide you maybe already saw from Munawar's earlier maybe already saw from Munawar's earlier maybe already saw from Munawar's earlier presentation. So this is the uh this is presentation. So this is the uh this is presentation. So this is the uh this is how Airflow uh vulnerabilities looked how Airflow uh vulnerabilities looked how Airflow uh vulnerabilities looked like over time. So this is like from like over time. So this is like from like over time. So this is like from 2015 to 2024. You see this is the 2015 to 2024. You see this is the 2015 to 2024. You see this is the activity the blue one is the activity activity the blue one is the activity activity the blue one is the activity that happened on the project and on the that happened on the project and on the that happened on the project and on the uh at the at the at the top you'll see uh at the at the at the top you'll see uh at the at the at the top you'll see that these are these are the that these are these are the that these are these are the vulnerabilities that were discovered and vulnerabilities that were discovered and vulnerabilities that were discovered and uh published in airflow and you can see uh published in airflow and you can see uh published in airflow and you can see something happened here in 2023 that something happened here in 2023 that something happened here in 2023 that this kind of flow of those this kind of flow of those this kind of flow of those vulnerabilities or the number of vulnerabilities or the number of vulnerabilities or the number of resolved vulnerabilities suddenly went resolved vulnerabilities suddenly went resolved vulnerabilities suddenly went down and this is because uh we've done down and this is because uh we've done down and this is because uh we've done quite a lot of security improvements so quite a lot of security improvements so quite a lot of security improvements so that just just just to show you the kind that just just just to show you the kind that just just just to show you the kind of work that you we we've already done of work that you we we've already done of work that you we we've already done that. So we've built a dedicated that. So we've built a dedicated that. So we've built a dedicated security team. We created and documented security team. We created and documented security team. We created and documented dedicate detailed process. We we dedicate detailed process. We we dedicate detailed process. We we introduced the security model. We had introduced the security model. We had introduced the security model. We had some kind response to issues to security some kind response to issues to security some kind response to issues to security reporters so that communication with reporters so that communication with reporters so that communication with them can be improved. Uh we disabled them can be improved. Uh we disabled them can be improved. Uh we disabled some inherently secure insecure some inherently secure insecure some inherently secure insecure features. We hardened out CI workflows. features. We hardened out CI workflows. features. We hardened out CI workflows. We've done all the stuff that uh all We've done all the stuff that uh all We've done all the stuff that uh all good open source projects should do. and good open source projects should do. and good open source projects should do. and uh and also like introduced reproducible uh and also like introduced reproducible uh and also like introduced reproducible build. Um we have like 15 people in the build. Um we have like 15 people in the build. Um we have like 15 people in the security team, five people are more or security team, five people are more or security team, five people are more or less active. We have like 66 committ 66 less active. We have like 66 committ 66 less active. We have like 66 committ 66 committer, 33 PMC members, 3,200 committer, 33 PMC members, 3,200 committer, 33 PMC members, 3,200 committers and the thing is like the so committers and the thing is like the so committers and the thing is like the so we are big enough to attract uh good we are big enough to attract uh good we are big enough to attract uh good stakeholders. We have really good like stakeholders. We have really good like stakeholders. We have really good like attract attention and funding. So we attract attention and funding. So we attract attention and funding. So we have a very good stakeholders Amazon, have a very good stakeholders Amazon, have a very good stakeholders Amazon, Google, uh, astronomer, Microsoft they Google, uh, astronomer, Microsoft they Google, uh, astronomer, Microsoft they are all uh providing airflow as a are all uh providing airflow as a are all uh providing airflow as a service and they are contributing back service and they are contributing back service and they are contributing back to the project. Uh we also attracted to the project. Uh we also attracted to the project. Uh we also attracted funding from sovereign tech fund and funding from sovereign tech fund and funding from sovereign tech fund and this is the money that funded all the this is the money that funded all the this is the money that funded all the security effort that I discussed before. security effort that I discussed before. security effort that I discussed before. Uh, and as of 2024 we work with with Uh, and as of 2024 we work with with Uh, and as of 2024 we work with with Michael. Um and the thing here so this Michael. Um and the thing here so this Michael. Um and the thing here so this is our dependency tree and you if you is our dependency tree and you if you is our dependency tree and you if you see it's like 579 this is kind of just see it's like 579 this is kind of just see it's like 579 this is kind of just basic security by basic dependency graph basic security by basic dependency graph basic security by basic dependency graph without all the external optional without all the external optional without all the external optional dependencies. So we have a lot of those dependencies. So we have a lot of those dependencies. So we have a lot of those dependencies altogether we have more dependencies altogether we have more dependencies altogether we have more than 700 as Michael mentioned. So we than 700 as Michael mentioned. So we than 700 as Michael mentioned. So we were a very good candidate because like were a very good candidate because like were a very good candidate because like we can attract funding and attention and we can attract funding and attention and we can attract funding and attention and we know that many of our dependencies we know that many of our dependencies we know that many of our dependencies cannot um and how the how the so so we cannot um and how the how the so so we cannot um and how the how the so so we we looked at the how we can work we looked at the how we can work we looked at the how we can work together with like Apache software together with like Apache software together with like Apache software foundation the PMC members of our foundation the PMC members of our foundation the PMC members of our airflow Python software foundation airflow Python software foundation airflow Python software foundation Michael Lararsson was involved uh whom Michael Lararsson was involved uh whom Michael Lararsson was involved uh whom Alpha Omega is uh uh is funding his Alpha Omega is uh uh is funding his Alpha Omega is uh uh is funding his position in in Python uh world and Alpha position in in Python uh world and Alpha position in in Python uh world and Alpha Omega fund uh uh came in and we Omega fund uh uh came in and we Omega fund uh uh came in and we discussed okay what we can do to discussed okay what we can do to discussed okay what we can do to actually um know which of our which our actually um know which of our which our actually um know which of our which our dependencies are are potentially dependencies are are potentially dependencies are are potentially problematic and what we should do with problematic and what we should do with problematic and what we should do with them. So we didn't want to do the full them. So we didn't want to do the full them. So we didn't want to do the full audit on like you know going into audit on like you know going into audit on like you know going into looking how many CVS they have looking looking how many CVS they have looking looking how many CVS they have looking at their code and reviewing that but at their code and reviewing that but at their code and reviewing that but basically we think that we should know basically we think that we should know basically we think that we should know our dependencies maybe not all of them our dependencies maybe not all of them our dependencies maybe not all of them uh in person directly to talk to all the uh in person directly to talk to all the uh in person directly to talk to all the 700 maintainers uh or teams of 700 maintainers uh or teams of 700 maintainers uh or teams of maintainers but for sure to our direct maintainers but for sure to our direct maintainers but for sure to our direct dependencies we can talk and know and dependencies we can talk and know and dependencies we can talk and know and know who who who the who those who those know who who who the who those who those know who who who the who those who those people are. We know how what is their people are. We know how what is their people are. We know how what is their security posture whether they are uh security posture whether they are uh security posture whether they are uh secure enough for us and more secure enough for us and more secure enough for us and more importantly uh we want to go to them and importantly uh we want to go to them and importantly uh we want to go to them and ask them to help them to improve their ask them to help them to improve their ask them to help them to improve their security because we now our security is security because we now our security is security because we now our security is pretty like it's not good but like well pretty like it's not good but like well pretty like it's not good but like well I wouldn't say it's like we well it's I wouldn't say it's like we well it's I wouldn't say it's like we well it's good it's not like we are secure we we good it's not like we are secure we we good it's not like we are secure we we work and we are actively working on our work and we are actively working on our work and we are actively working on our security but we are only as secure as security but we are only as secure as security but we are only as secure as our dependencies so we uh eventually we our dependencies so we uh eventually we our dependencies so we uh eventually we want to review all the dependencies want to review all the dependencies want to review all the dependencies maybe not directly maybe transitively maybe not directly maybe transitively maybe not directly maybe transitively through others but generally we want to through others but generally we want to through others but generally we want to know who they are and what they do and know who they are and what they do and know who they are and what they do and whether they are secure or not. Uh we whether they are secure or not. Uh we whether they are secure or not. Uh we are continuously learning and trying to are continuously learning and trying to are continuously learning and trying to uh figure out better ways of doing that. uh figure out better ways of doing that. uh figure out better ways of doing that. Uh eventually we want to automate that Uh eventually we want to automate that Uh eventually we want to automate that to scale and we want to look at the like to scale and we want to look at the like to scale and we want to look at the like when we look at our dependencies when we when we look at our dependencies when we when we look at our dependencies when we talk to them we want to understand how talk to them we want to understand how talk to them we want to understand how the their security impacts us. is like the their security impacts us. is like the their security impacts us. is like not like some vanity metrics that can be not like some vanity metrics that can be not like some vanity metrics that can be assigned to the project, but like what assigned to the project, but like what assigned to the project, but like what does it mean for um our dep like this does it mean for um our dep like this does it mean for um our dep like this dependency for example can bring a lot dependency for example can bring a lot dependency for example can bring a lot of other dependencies to us and we uh we of other dependencies to us and we uh we of other dependencies to us and we uh we know that this particular dependency is know that this particular dependency is know that this particular dependency is problematic for us as a project because problematic for us as a project because problematic for us as a project because it brings us a lot more other it brings us a lot more other it brings us a lot more other dependencies that can bring more dependencies that can bring more dependencies that can bring more vulnerabilities. So we look at those vulnerabilities. So we look at those vulnerabilities. So we look at those dependencies from the perspective of of dependencies from the perspective of of dependencies from the perspective of of Apache Airflow. uh and we always Apache Airflow. uh and we always Apache Airflow. uh and we always remember the people. So we want to talk remember the people. So we want to talk remember the people. So we want to talk to people. This is the important part. to people. This is the important part. to people. This is the important part. This is like most important part what This is like most important part what This is like most important part what we've learned that numbers and we had a we've learned that numbers and we had a we've learned that numbers and we had a lot of talks here today and the last few lot of talks here today and the last few lot of talks here today and the last few days about producing numbers, producing days about producing numbers, producing days about producing numbers, producing statistics, producing sbonds, producing statistics, producing sbonds, producing statistics, producing sbonds, producing information. This is really cool and information. This is really cool and information. This is really cool and fantastic for as a tool. But eventually fantastic for as a tool. But eventually fantastic for as a tool. But eventually we want to make sure not that numbers we want to make sure not that numbers we want to make sure not that numbers are right but the the people that we are right but the the people that we are right but the the people that we talk to and the maintainers and the talk to and the maintainers and the talk to and the maintainers and the projects we talk to they also understand projects we talk to they also understand projects we talk to they also understand that there is someone interested in sec that there is someone interested in sec that there is someone interested in sec in their security that can help them in their security that can help them in their security that can help them that can reach out to them and that they that can reach out to them and that they that can reach out to them and that they can talk to uh and that they care about can talk to uh and that they care about can talk to uh and that they care about their their their security. Uh so what what it started security. Uh so what what it started security. Uh so what what it started with so from the sbombs so we use the with so from the sbombs so we use the with so from the sbombs so we use the sbombs generated by cyclon the x uh of sbombs generated by cyclon the x uh of sbombs generated by cyclon the x uh of airflow we produce them regularly. So we airflow we produce them regularly. So we airflow we produce them regularly. So we generated the list of uh kind of prime generated the list of uh kind of prime generated the list of uh kind of prime candidates to talk to. We start small. candidates to talk to. We start small. candidates to talk to. We start small. We started with like 16 uh dependencies We started with like 16 uh dependencies We started with like 16 uh dependencies uh initially uh and we produce some uh initially uh and we produce some uh initially uh and we produce some automated assessment and this can later automated assessment and this can later automated assessment and this can later in the future be improved to you know we in the future be improved to you know we in the future be improved to you know we we talk we heard about all the AI tools we talk we heard about all the AI tools we talk we heard about all the AI tools and Michael is uh and and the other and Michael is uh and and the other and Michael is uh and and the other Michael they are exploring different Michael they are exploring different Michael they are exploring different ways how similar numbers can be ways how similar numbers can be ways how similar numbers can be retrieved more easily. Uh but those are retrieved more easily. Uh but those are retrieved more easily. Uh but those are the numbers that tell us not only those the numbers that tell us not only those the numbers that tell us not only those are open PSF scorecards. Uh some are open PSF scorecards. Uh some are open PSF scorecards. Uh some analysis that I added additionally to analysis that I added additionally to analysis that I added additionally to that uh trying to figure out which that uh trying to figure out which that uh trying to figure out which dependencies are important to us and dependencies are important to us and dependencies are important to us and which which are like uh important for which which are like uh important for which which are like uh important for the industry as well. uh and from that the industry as well. uh and from that the industry as well. uh and from that this spreadsheet automatically generates this spreadsheet automatically generates this spreadsheet automatically generates also the actions that I can go and talk also the actions that I can go and talk also the actions that I can go and talk and propose to those uh uh those those and propose to those uh uh those those and propose to those uh uh those those maintainers and those projects in terms maintainers and those projects in terms maintainers and those projects in terms of what can be improved in their of what can be improved in their of what can be improved in their security and uh so those actions here uh security and uh so those actions here uh security and uh so those actions here uh this is like this is how we like this is like this is how we like this is like this is how we like generated the initial list of projects generated the initial list of projects generated the initial list of projects we talked to we had like the emails we we talked to we had like the emails we we talked to we had like the emails we have the contacts I I reached out to the have the contacts I I reached out to the have the contacts I I reached out to the maintainers and the things that I want maintainers and the things that I want maintainers and the things that I want to talk to them about and that's how it to talk to them about and that's how it to talk to them about and that's how it started. uh the human component in started. uh the human component in started. uh the human component in security bug reporting is important and security bug reporting is important and security bug reporting is important and that's uh that's something that also that's uh that's something that also that's uh that's something that also Monaw mentioned before at the Monaw mentioned before at the Monaw mentioned before at the presentation when they reported issues presentation when they reported issues presentation when they reported issues to our maintainers to to to to our to to our maintainers to to to to our to to our maintainers to to to to our to our to our dependencies there was very our to our dependencies there was very our to our dependencies there was very little reaction uh and eventually where little reaction uh and eventually where little reaction uh and eventually where uh I reached out as a maintainer of uh I reached out as a maintainer of uh I reached out as a maintainer of airflow who is their dependency their airflow who is their dependency their airflow who is their dependency their user it was like the fix in like few user it was like the fix in like few user it was like the fix in like few days or few hours there a quick days or few hours there a quick days or few hours there a quick reaction. We have we received it this reaction. We have we received it this reaction. We have we received it this report from you. We we see that your report from you. We we see that your report from you. We we see that your issue uh there is there's a particular issue uh there is there's a particular issue uh there is there's a particular vulner vulnerability or particular vulner vulnerability or particular vulner vulnerability or particular problem in your code. We got that report problem in your code. We got that report problem in your code. We got that report but we ignored it because it looked like but we ignored it because it looked like but we ignored it because it looked like an automated report but when a person an automated report but when a person an automated report but when a person like me came to them as a maintainer uh like me came to them as a maintainer uh like me came to them as a maintainer uh they reacted and they did uh uh they they reacted and they did uh uh they they reacted and they did uh uh they actually fixed the problem. So like this actually fixed the problem. So like this actually fixed the problem. So like this is like a very small font but uh the the is like a very small font but uh the the is like a very small font but uh the the message is like yeah we fixed. So message is like yeah we fixed. So message is like yeah we fixed. So experiment was in progress. Uh we have experiment was in progress. Uh we have experiment was in progress. Uh we have 16 projects. We added security. We 16 projects. We added security. We 16 projects. We added security. We proposed them adding security policies. proposed them adding security policies. proposed them adding security policies. F follow up on unsecure workflows. F follow up on unsecure workflows. F follow up on unsecure workflows. Proposed them to implement trusted Proposed them to implement trusted Proposed them to implement trusted publishing. Following up on unpatched publishing. Following up on unpatched publishing. Following up on unpatched vulnerabilities they have and some vulnerabilities they have and some vulnerabilities they have and some propose some mandatory code review. So propose some mandatory code review. So propose some mandatory code review. So these are the actions that we started to these are the actions that we started to these are the actions that we started to talk to those projects that they should talk to those projects that they should talk to those projects that they should do that if they didn't have them. And do that if they didn't have them. And do that if they didn't have them. And then we talked to them from the position then we talked to them from the position then we talked to them from the position of the of other maintainers who are of the of other maintainers who are of the of other maintainers who are doing the same things. So it's not like doing the same things. So it's not like doing the same things. So it's not like we like somebody random comes to them we like somebody random comes to them we like somebody random comes to them and say like fix it. It's just a and say like fix it. It's just a and say like fix it. It's just a maintainer of another project comes to maintainer of another project comes to maintainer of another project comes to them and also says okay and I want to them and also says okay and I want to them and also says okay and I want to help you and I want to want to make a PR help you and I want to want to make a PR help you and I want to want to make a PR and submit a PR to you and and help you and submit a PR to you and and help you and submit a PR to you and and help you to improve your security which actually to improve your security which actually to improve your security which actually the was the important the most important the was the important the most important the was the important the most important part of the project was to start the part of the project was to start the part of the project was to start the conversation between us and our vulner conversation between us and our vulner conversation between us and our vulner our our our dependencies. Uh so we had a different dependencies. Uh so we had a different dependencies. Uh so we had a different kinds of responses. Uh one is like uh no kinds of responses. Uh one is like uh no kinds of responses. Uh one is like uh no response at all of course and we will response at all of course and we will response at all of course and we will follow up later. It was like happy to follow up later. It was like happy to follow up later. It was like happy to get help or great to get help. I'm I get help or great to get help. I'm I get help or great to get help. I'm I will be happy to get those PRs and help. will be happy to get those PRs and help. will be happy to get those PRs and help. Uh another one I will also uh a security Uh another one I will also uh a security Uh another one I will also uh a security freak somebody uh almost as security freak somebody uh almost as security freak somebody uh almost as security freak as I was uh and I will in yeah I freak as I was uh and I will in yeah I freak as I was uh and I will in yeah I will involve him later in in in lots of will involve him later in in in lots of will involve him later in in in lots of other act things that I do about other act things that I do about other act things that I do about security. But there was also one case security. But there was also one case security. But there was also one case about chroner uh which uh which I want about chroner uh which uh which I want about chroner uh which uh which I want to talk later before and now my so when to talk later before and now my so when to talk later before and now my so when we now go to the next we now go to the next we now go to the next slide one of the really great things slide one of the really great things slide one of the really great things that came out of this whole experiment that came out of this whole experiment that came out of this whole experiment was understanding about both the was understanding about both the was understanding about both the economics and the social aspects of how economics and the social aspects of how economics and the social aspects of how to deal with your upstream supply. So to deal with your upstream supply. So to deal with your upstream supply. So let's say you're a corporation and let's say you're a corporation and let's say you're a corporation and magically is using some software from magically is using some software from magically is using some software from some open source unlike every other some open source unlike every other some open source unlike every other competitor you have. You're the only competitor you have. You're the only competitor you have. You're the only ones doing it and it's just your ones doing it and it's just your ones doing it and it's just your problem, right? Not so much. In fact, problem, right? Not so much. In fact, problem, right? Not so much. In fact, most companies like, well, I'll let most companies like, well, I'll let most companies like, well, I'll let somebody else fix that. We'll just wait somebody else fix that. We'll just wait somebody else fix that. We'll just wait for the fix come up and it's not our for the fix come up and it's not our for the fix come up and it's not our problem until it becomes something we problem until it becomes something we problem until it becomes something we have to deal with. And then you have have to deal with. And then you have have to deal with. And then you have absolutely no muscle to deal with it. So absolutely no muscle to deal with it. So absolutely no muscle to deal with it. So here's the really hard truth. If you're here's the really hard truth. If you're here's the really hard truth. If you're using some external software, whether using some external software, whether using some external software, whether it's from a vendor or from an open it's from a vendor or from an open it's from a vendor or from an open source play thing, there's no source play thing, there's no source play thing, there's no difference. It's your code. It's your difference. It's your code. It's your difference. It's your code. It's your problem. And you have exactly three problem. And you have exactly three problem. And you have exactly three choices. You're either going to be part choices. You're either going to be part choices. You're either going to be part of fixing the problems because there's of fixing the problems because there's of fixing the problems because there's always problems. You're going to fork it always problems. You're going to fork it always problems. You're going to fork it and start maintaining your own copy, and start maintaining your own copy, and start maintaining your own copy, which by the way, if you do nothing, which by the way, if you do nothing, which by the way, if you do nothing, you're now maintaining an unsanctioned, you're now maintaining an unsanctioned, you're now maintaining an unsanctioned, unmanaged, and unsupported fork of some unmanaged, and unsupported fork of some unmanaged, and unsupported fork of some upstream thing that you don't upstream thing that you don't upstream thing that you don't understand, right? That's not a good understand, right? That's not a good understand, right? That's not a good one. But if you want to fork it to start one. But if you want to fork it to start one. But if you want to fork it to start making patches to yourself. So you can making patches to yourself. So you can making patches to yourself. So you can say they're not patching it. We can. say they're not patching it. We can. say they're not patching it. We can. That's a great thing. It requires time That's a great thing. It requires time That's a great thing. It requires time and energy. Or you can f forget it. stop and energy. Or you can f forget it. stop and energy. Or you can f forget it. stop using it. Right? That's actually one of using it. Right? That's actually one of using it. Right? That's actually one of the most effective things. Like, stop the most effective things. Like, stop the most effective things. Like, stop using this crap. It's not making your using this crap. It's not making your using this crap. It's not making your life safe. It's making it worse. If you life safe. It's making it worse. If you life safe. It's making it worse. If you can get rid of it from your supply, can get rid of it from your supply, can get rid of it from your supply, great. But that gets harder and harder great. But that gets harder and harder great. But that gets harder and harder as the problem child is deeper in your as the problem child is deeper in your as the problem child is deeper in your dependency graph. And so, you don't have dependency graph. And so, you don't have dependency graph. And so, you don't have actionability. So, your actionability. So, your actionability. So, your imperative is to start thinking across imperative is to start thinking across imperative is to start thinking across those dimensions and then actually those dimensions and then actually those dimensions and then actually making those human connections. How many making those human connections. How many making those human connections. How many of you are commercial software builders of you are commercial software builders of you are commercial software builders and have commercial vendors that provide and have commercial vendors that provide and have commercial vendors that provide pieces of software to you or a service pieces of software to you or a service pieces of software to you or a service something like that? Only one a few something like that? Only one a few something like that? Only one a few more. Do you have any kind of vendor more. Do you have any kind of vendor more. Do you have any kind of vendor relationship management? Do you have a relationship management? Do you have a relationship management? Do you have a contract? You have you have something in contract? You have you have something in contract? You have you have something in touch with them. Right now we'll ask the touch with them. Right now we'll ask the touch with them. Right now we'll ask the same question. How many of you use open same question. How many of you use open same question. How many of you use open source software? How many of you are in source software? How many of you are in source software? How many of you are in contact with any of your upstream contact with any of your upstream contact with any of your upstream suppliers? A couple. Right. Grudgingly, suppliers? A couple. Right. Grudgingly, suppliers? A couple. Right. Grudgingly, right? Need to change that. Right? If right? Need to change that. Right? If right? Need to change that. Right? If you ask your risk management people, you ask your risk management people, you ask your risk management people, should we be okay and not having knowing should we be okay and not having knowing should we be okay and not having knowing who this vendor is and having no contact who this vendor is and having no contact who this vendor is and having no contact with them, they would tell you you're with them, they would tell you you're with them, they would tell you you're out of your freaking mind. And yet out of your freaking mind. And yet out of your freaking mind. And yet you're doing exactly that. So this you're doing exactly that. So this you're doing exactly that. So this framework has turned out to be really framework has turned out to be really framework has turned out to be really powerful as a way to reason about it and powerful as a way to reason about it and powerful as a way to reason about it and it's shaping how that organization works it's shaping how that organization works it's shaping how that organization works and other organizations works. It works and other organizations works. It works and other organizations works. It works for commercial vendors. It works for for commercial vendors. It works for for commercial vendors. It works for open source projects. It helps us open source projects. It helps us open source projects. It helps us prioritize work and we learn a lot along prioritize work and we learn a lot along prioritize work and we learn a lot along the way. Get to the next slide. So that the way. Get to the next slide. So that the way. Get to the next slide. So that there are some concrete things that I there are some concrete things that I there are some concrete things that I want to talk about. uh uh the very want to talk about. uh uh the very want to talk about. uh uh the very interesting case uh resulting from this interesting case uh resulting from this interesting case uh resulting from this like one of like one of like one of the quite known cases there was there the quite known cases there was there the quite known cases there was there were chroner project a very small were chroner project a very small were chroner project a very small dependency of ours which uh uh but very dependency of ours which uh uh but very dependency of ours which uh uh but very important because like all our versions important because like all our versions important because like all our versions of our software dependent on that and of our software dependent on that and of our software dependent on that and maintainer threatened to remove the the maintainer threatened to remove the the maintainer threatened to remove the the project because of CRA. So like they project because of CRA. So like they project because of CRA. So like they said CRA is coming I have no time to said CRA is coming I have no time to said CRA is coming I have no time to maintain it. I will not take the risk maintain it. I will not take the risk maintain it. I will not take the risk and I will remove it and we started and I will remove it and we started and I will remove it and we started discussion and the the whole thing was discussion and the the whole thing was discussion and the the whole thing was like okay we discuss as a user with them like okay we discuss as a user with them like okay we discuss as a user with them uh we started like GitHub issue and uh we started like GitHub issue and uh we started like GitHub issue and discussing uh in the public issue and discussing uh in the public issue and discussing uh in the public issue and there were a number of people who there were a number of people who there were a number of people who volunteered to fork it. So it was volunteered to fork it. So it was volunteered to fork it. So it was already like this was like a fork kind already like this was like a fork kind already like this was like a fork kind of case. Uh we almost did it like it was of case. Uh we almost did it like it was of case. Uh we almost did it like it was like we almost did the fork but like we almost did the fork but like we almost did the fork but eventually what happened uh the way eventually what happened uh the way eventually what happened uh the way better the whole project moved to uh better the whole project moved to uh better the whole project moved to uh pallet echo and me and the other pallet echo and me and the other pallet echo and me and the other maintainer of airflow became the maintainer of airflow became the maintainer of airflow became the maintainer of this project because we maintainer of this project because we maintainer of this project because we decided we want to keep it running under decided we want to keep it running under decided we want to keep it running under the uh uh pallet echo which is a small the uh uh pallet echo which is a small the uh uh pallet echo which is a small kind of steward open source steward in kind of steward open source steward in kind of steward open source steward in the future. uh and we saved the project. the future. uh and we saved the project. the future. uh and we saved the project. Um uh the second one uh the second case Um uh the second one uh the second case Um uh the second one uh the second case with a fix uh so we had a transitive with a fix uh so we had a transitive with a fix uh so we had a transitive dependency which is like vortake very uh dependency which is like vortake very uh dependency which is like vortake very uh difficult for us to to handle any difficult for us to to handle any difficult for us to to handle any security issues there because it's held security issues there because it's held security issues there because it's held by other dependencies and uh eventually by other dependencies and uh eventually by other dependencies and uh eventually what happened we discussed what we can what happened we discussed what we can what happened we discussed what we can do and we involved our stakeholders we do and we involved our stakeholders we do and we involved our stakeholders we discussed okay this is this is something discussed okay this is this is something discussed okay this is this is something we know we have to fix and eventually we know we have to fix and eventually we know we have to fix and eventually right now Google team is working on a right now Google team is working on a right now Google team is working on a security on a security team from Google security on a security team from Google security on a security team from Google from one one of our stakeholders is from one one of our stakeholders is from one one of our stakeholders is working on patching it. It's so fixing working on patching it. It's so fixing working on patching it. It's so fixing it for us patching the old version so it for us patching the old version so it for us patching the old version so that we can actually use it. So that was that we can actually use it. So that was that we can actually use it. So that was the also the result of this discussion. the also the result of this discussion. the also the result of this discussion. The the third one was like the for for The the third one was like the for for The the third one was like the for for go um and so we had another dependency go um and so we had another dependency go um and so we had another dependency which was somewhat connected to uh to which was somewhat connected to uh to which was somewhat connected to uh to verte uh and flask. It was very verte uh and flask. It was very verte uh and flask. It was very difficult to upgrade. We couldn't do it. difficult to upgrade. We couldn't do it. difficult to upgrade. We couldn't do it. We tried it uh and failed uh and uh we We tried it uh and failed uh and uh we We tried it uh and failed uh and uh we Google security team also started Google security team also started Google security team also started working on patching it but that didn't working on patching it but that didn't working on patching it but that didn't really work and eventually we switched really work and eventually we switched really work and eventually we switched to a fast API we just removed the to a fast API we just removed the to a fast API we just removed the dependency from our tree because we dependency from our tree because we dependency from our tree because we decided okay we and we talked to the decided okay we and we talked to the decided okay we and we talked to the maintainers of course we we tried to maintainers of course we we tried to maintainers of course we we tried to figure out how we can work with them and figure out how we can work with them and figure out how we can work with them and we decided no it's not going to work for we decided no it's not going to work for we decided no it's not going to work for us. So this is kind of like this is a us. So this is kind of like this is a us. So this is kind of like this is a way for us like just to actively look at way for us like just to actively look at way for us like just to actively look at our dependencies and all of them our dependencies and all of them our dependencies and all of them eventually and decide what to do with eventually and decide what to do with eventually and decide what to do with them based on this 3F framework and them based on this 3F framework and them based on this 3F framework and long-term targets like full automation long-term targets like full automation long-term targets like full automation and better coverage and maybe AI will and better coverage and maybe AI will and better coverage and maybe AI will help us with that. We are discussing all help us with that. We are discussing all help us with that. We are discussing all things about uh target all the projects things about uh target all the projects things about uh target all the projects all the dependencies. We want to make it all the dependencies. We want to make it all the dependencies. We want to make it into a regular incremental process that into a regular incremental process that into a regular incremental process that not only we but also others can follow not only we but also others can follow not only we but also others can follow by spreading the methodology in findings by spreading the methodology in findings by spreading the methodology in findings and we're talking about that uh and and we're talking about that uh and and we're talking about that uh and maybe contributed to other efforts like maybe contributed to other efforts like maybe contributed to other efforts like PSF can make it into some kind of PSF can make it into some kind of PSF can make it into some kind of standard thing learnings. So, one of the most interesting insights So, one of the most interesting insights So, one of the most interesting insights from this was what makes for a good from this was what makes for a good from this was what makes for a good project like this for us to go and for project like this for us to go and for project like this for us to go and for us to fund something where we spent a us to fund something where we spent a us to fund something where we spent a remarkably small amount of money and remarkably small amount of money and remarkably small amount of money and then change the direction of a then change the direction of a then change the direction of a well-unded project and what well-unded project and what well-unded project and what characterizes airflow is that it is characterizes airflow is that it is characterizes airflow is that it is close to revenue for a bunch of close to revenue for a bunch of close to revenue for a bunch of businesses. So Amazon, Microsoft, Google businesses. So Amazon, Microsoft, Google businesses. So Amazon, Microsoft, Google and Air and Astronomer are all able to and Air and Astronomer are all able to and Air and Astronomer are all able to monetize Airflow as a service. And so monetize Airflow as a service. And so monetize Airflow as a service. And so for them, putting engineers on that for them, putting engineers on that for them, putting engineers on that project is very easy to justify. The ROI project is very easy to justify. The ROI project is very easy to justify. The ROI is clear and the risk is also very is clear and the risk is also very is clear and the risk is also very clear. And so by starting this small clear. And so by starting this small clear. And so by starting this small project, we change the perspective of project, we change the perspective of project, we change the perspective of the entire airflow organization and the entire airflow organization and the entire airflow organization and prioritize a set of security fixes. And prioritize a set of security fixes. And prioritize a set of security fixes. And now they are putting energy upstream. I now they are putting energy upstream. I now they are putting energy upstream. I draw it this way because it's the tree draw it this way because it's the tree draw it this way because it's the tree is hard to represent, but they're going is hard to represent, but they're going is hard to represent, but they're going up to their supply chain and working on up to their supply chain and working on up to their supply chain and working on fixing it. And so where there is money, fixing it. And so where there is money, fixing it. And so where there is money, engineering resources can happen, right? engineering resources can happen, right? engineering resources can happen, right? A lot of these smaller projects, you A lot of these smaller projects, you A lot of these smaller projects, you can't give them money. They don't have can't give them money. They don't have can't give them money. They don't have any more nights and weekends to work on any more nights and weekends to work on any more nights and weekends to work on this or they're not an entity that you this or they're not an entity that you this or they're not an entity that you could really comfortably give money. So could really comfortably give money. So could really comfortably give money. So that's one of the key learnings about that's one of the key learnings about that's one of the key learnings about the economics of this. the economics of this. the economics of this. Oh, that's you. That's me. Okay. Yeah. Oh, that's you. That's me. Okay. Yeah. Oh, that's you. That's me. Okay. Yeah. So this is fundamentally a human So this is fundamentally a human So this is fundamentally a human problem, right? problem, right? problem, right? All crossorganizational problems are All crossorganizational problems are All crossorganizational problems are human first and technical second. Right? human first and technical second. Right? human first and technical second. Right? That is true for vendors. That is true That is true for vendors. That is true That is true for vendors. That is true for open source. You have to deal with for open source. You have to deal with for open source. You have to deal with that. that. that. Right? The transitive problem is much Right? The transitive problem is much Right? The transitive problem is much bigger than we understand. It's bigger than we understand. It's bigger than we understand. It's exponential and it creates it doesn't exponential and it creates it doesn't exponential and it creates it doesn't sort of coales down to a small number sort of coales down to a small number sort of coales down to a small number very quickly. Eventually does because very quickly. Eventually does because very quickly. Eventually does because they all sort of use the same they all sort of use the same they all sort of use the same dependencies, but it gets big fast and dependencies, but it gets big fast and dependencies, but it gets big fast and that creates risk fast. And there are no that creates risk fast. And there are no that creates risk fast. And there are no small dependencies. You could look at small dependencies. You could look at small dependencies. You could look at whatever scorecard thing you want. It whatever scorecard thing you want. It whatever scorecard thing you want. It doesn't matter. Every dependency in your doesn't matter. Every dependency in your doesn't matter. Every dependency in your tree has total access to your build tree has total access to your build tree has total access to your build environment. Exfiltration of a build environment. Exfiltration of a build environment. Exfiltration of a build secrets because you're all really good secrets because you're all really good secrets because you're all really good at that. And total access to your at that. And total access to your at that. And total access to your production environment. What could production environment. What could production environment. What could possibly go wrong? Right? And you could possibly go wrong? Right? And you could possibly go wrong? Right? And you could say, well, we sandbox things. We do say, well, we sandbox things. We do say, well, we sandbox things. We do callraph. I'm like, You do callraph. I'm like, You do callraph. I'm like, You do not. And you're nowhere good at it. And not. And you're nowhere good at it. And not. And you're nowhere good at it. And nobody's close to that, right? Is a it's nobody's close to that, right? Is a it's nobody's close to that, right? Is a it's a science project. Um, so that's it, I a science project. Um, so that's it, I a science project. Um, so that's it, I think. Uh, thank you very much for your think. Uh, thank you very much for your think. Uh, thank you very much for your time. really thank you to Yaric and the time. really thank you to Yaric and the time. really thank you to Yaric and the team at team at team at Airflow. What we're able to do with with Airflow. What we're able to do with with Airflow. What we're able to do with with uh with this project has actually uh with this project has actually uh with this project has actually transformed our approach to funding transformed our approach to funding transformed our approach to funding security and we hope it's leaking into security and we hope it's leaking into security and we hope it's leaking into other parts of the industry as well. other parts of the industry as well. other parts of the industry as well. Again, thank you. Thank you all for Again, thank you. Thank you all for Again, thank you. Thank you all for coming today. We we can take questions for a today. We we can take questions for a today. We we can take questions for a bit. Um if you have questions about bit. Um if you have questions about bit. Um if you have questions about Alpha Omega, just come to my talk at Alpha Omega, just come to my talk at Alpha Omega, just come to my talk at 1:00 in room six. Be talking for an hour 1:00 in room six. Be talking for an hour 1:00 in room six. Be talking for an hour on tons two two o'clock. All right, on tons two two o'clock. All right, on tons two two o'clock. All right, 2:00. Lots of lessons to discuss there, 2:00. Lots of lessons to discuss there, 2:00. Lots of lessons to discuss there, but happy to take questions for this but happy to take questions for this but happy to take questions for this right right right now. I'll repeat a question rather than now. I'll repeat a question rather than now. I'll repeat a question rather than jugging the mic. Just say it. Oh, here. jugging the mic. Just say it. Oh, here. jugging the mic. Just say it. Oh, here. Yeah, thank you so much for the work Yeah, thank you so much for the work Yeah, thank you so much for the work that you're doing there. I think it's um that you're doing there. I think it's um that you're doing there. I think it's um really amazing and a strong sign and really amazing and a strong sign and really amazing and a strong sign and signal to the community. Um do you have signal to the community. Um do you have signal to the community. Um do you have any hard numbers on how much money you any hard numbers on how much money you any hard numbers on how much money you have saved Amazon, Microsoft and Google have saved Amazon, Microsoft and Google have saved Amazon, Microsoft and Google from this whole project initiative in in from this whole project initiative in in from this whole project initiative in in terms of internal security work they terms of internal security work they terms of internal security work they don't have to do anymore now? don't have to do anymore now? don't have to do anymore now? Uh that's a good question. I don't have Uh that's a good question. I don't have Uh that's a good question. I don't have hard numbers and I don't seek them right hard numbers and I don't seek them right hard numbers and I don't seek them right now because a lot of our work is sort of now because a lot of our work is sort of now because a lot of our work is sort of anecdotal to be honest. But anecdotal to be honest. But anecdotal to be honest. But um I can tell you that the from my um I can tell you that the from my um I can tell you that the from my perspective in terms of the return on perspective in terms of the return on perspective in terms of the return on investment for the amount we spent on investment for the amount we spent on investment for the amount we spent on the audit work uh I feel like the amount the audit work uh I feel like the amount the audit work uh I feel like the amount of energy that is flowing in and will of energy that is flowing in and will of energy that is flowing in and will continue to flow is at least 10x uh continue to flow is at least 10x uh continue to flow is at least 10x uh probably more than that overall. Um I probably more than that overall. Um I probably more than that overall. Um I think that measuring security R is very think that measuring security R is very think that measuring security R is very tricky because the more you put in the tricky because the more you put in the tricky because the more you put in the less obvious the need is for it. You can less obvious the need is for it. You can less obvious the need is for it. You can you asmtoic and so it's very tricky to you asmtoic and so it's very tricky to you asmtoic and so it's very tricky to measure that like we're secure now so we measure that like we're secure now so we measure that like we're secure now so we should stop spending money. Oh wait no should stop spending money. Oh wait no should stop spending money. Oh wait no we have to keep spending money. It's we have to keep spending money. It's we have to keep spending money. It's it's complicated. Next question. it's complicated. Next question. it's complicated. Next question. Question. Hey um can you give one minute Question. Hey um can you give one minute Question. Hey um can you give one minute on tamurine the tamuran case study? on tamurine the tamuran case study? on tamurine the tamuran case study? Tamarind. Yes Tamarind. Yes Tamarind. Yes which is different than this. Totally which is different than this. Totally which is different than this. Totally different. Yes. Yes. Can you give one different. Yes. Yes. Can you give one different. Yes. Yes. Can you give one minute summary to so? Hemorrh is uh if minute summary to so? Hemorrh is uh if minute summary to so? Hemorrh is uh if you think about your supply chain uh you think about your supply chain uh you think about your supply chain uh quick question how many people here run quick question how many people here run quick question how many people here run Java applications? Lots of you right? Uh Java applications? Lots of you right? Uh Java applications? Lots of you right? Uh do you use the open JDK builds that come do you use the open JDK builds that come do you use the open JDK builds that come from free you dumbass stop doing it from free you dumbass stop doing it from free you dumbass stop doing it tomorrow right? It literally comes on tomorrow right? It literally comes on tomorrow right? It literally comes on the tin with use this under pain of the tin with use this under pain of the tin with use this under pain of security death you will do that don't security death you will do that don't security death you will do that don't right do you use the Oracle one do you right do you use the Oracle one do you right do you use the Oracle one do you like the licensing terms you get would like the licensing terms you get would like the licensing terms you get would you like one that is perhaps free and you like one that is perhaps free and you like one that is perhaps free and secure and tested and has reproducible secure and tested and has reproducible secure and tested and has reproducible builds now being reproduced by Red Hat builds now being reproduced by Red Hat builds now being reproduced by Red Hat and the adoption project at the Eclipse and the adoption project at the Eclipse and the adoption project at the Eclipse Foundation right this is tempan so Foundation right this is tempan so Foundation right this is tempan so tempan is a reproducible secure tempan is a reproducible secure tempan is a reproducible secure um TCK tested and also this other test um TCK tested and also this other test um TCK tested and also this other test which provides actual functional and which provides actual functional and which provides actual functional and performance testing called AVIT performance testing called AVIT performance testing called AVIT um built. It's done by part of the um built. It's done by part of the um built. It's done by part of the Eclipse Foundation. It is a consortium Eclipse Foundation. It is a consortium Eclipse Foundation. It is a consortium of engineering companies that work on of engineering companies that work on of engineering companies that work on the project. It is a pillar of supply the project. It is a pillar of supply the project. It is a pillar of supply chain security, not just in terms of chain security, not just in terms of chain security, not just in terms of reproducibility, but all their practices reproducibility, but all their practices reproducibility, but all their practices in their code reviews and their uh repo in their code reviews and their uh repo in their code reviews and their uh repo configurations and their build configurations and their build configurations and their build environments. Uh they're doing an environments. Uh they're doing an environments. Uh they're doing an amazing job. We don't need to give them amazing job. We don't need to give them amazing job. We don't need to give them money to do audits. We actually learn money to do audits. We actually learn money to do audits. We actually learn from them more often than not. Was that from them more often than not. Was that from them more often than not. Was that what you're hoping for me to say? what you're hoping for me to say? what you're hoping for me to say? Perfect. Okay. Yep. Uh, we've got time Perfect. Okay. Yep. Uh, we've got time Perfect. Okay. Yep. Uh, we've got time for one more for one more for one more question or and I know I'm between all question or and I know I'm between all question or and I know I'm between all of you and lunch. So, I don't see any of you and lunch. So, I don't see any of you and lunch. So, I don't see any other hands raised. So, let's get one other hands raised. So, let's get one other hands raised. So, let's get one more round of applause.
