Uh we're going to Uh I'm Patrick Gity. Uh we're going to Uh I'm Patrick Gity. Uh we're going to talk about exploited CVS of 2024 talk about exploited CVS of 2024 talk about exploited CVS of 2024 uh and trying to provide some lessons in uh and trying to provide some lessons in uh and trying to provide some lessons in uh for vendors and defenders uh along uh for vendors and defenders uh along uh for vendors and defenders uh along the way. Let me move that a little bit. the way. Let me move that a little bit. the way. Let me move that a little bit. Um I work for Vone. I'm a security Um I work for Vone. I'm a security Um I work for Vone. I'm a security researcher. We're a CNA. I do not issue researcher. We're a CNA. I do not issue researcher. We're a CNA. I do not issue the CBES. Uh but I work closely with our the CBES. Uh but I work closely with our the CBES. Uh but I work closely with our team. um uh our research team um uh and team. um uh our research team um uh and team. um uh our research team um uh and we're in the security research side. So we're in the security research side. So we're in the security research side. So uh spend a lot of time with different uh spend a lot of time with different uh spend a lot of time with different intelligence uh organizations helping uh intelligence uh organizations helping uh intelligence uh organizations helping uh get uh CB assignment um and coordination get uh CB assignment um and coordination get uh CB assignment um and coordination with them. Uh specifically focus on a with them. Uh specifically focus on a with them. Uh specifically focus on a lot of initial access and exploitation lot of initial access and exploitation lot of initial access and exploitation um uh and exploitation is what I'll be um uh and exploitation is what I'll be um uh and exploitation is what I'll be talking about today. I put this up don't talking about today. I put this up don't talking about today. I put this up don't shoot the messenger. Um, shoot the messenger. Um, shoot the messenger. Um, uh, there's CNAs here, which is great. uh, there's CNAs here, which is great. uh, there's CNAs here, which is great. I'm going to be talking about vendors I'm going to be talking about vendors I'm going to be talking about vendors and and products. The intention is to and and products. The intention is to and and products. The intention is to give some examples. Um, there's no give some examples. Um, there's no give some examples. Um, there's no reason I picked any of them out. Uh, uh, reason I picked any of them out. Uh, uh, reason I picked any of them out. Uh, uh, but we're going to be looking at all the but we're going to be looking at all the but we're going to be looking at all the exploited vulnerabilities. So, um, I exploited vulnerabilities. So, um, I exploited vulnerabilities. So, um, I just want to be mindful of that, uh, just want to be mindful of that, uh, just want to be mindful of that, uh, just in general. Um, uh, I'm trying to just in general. Um, uh, I'm trying to just in general. Um, uh, I'm trying to convey and share data as far as, you convey and share data as far as, you convey and share data as far as, you know, what people need to be thinking know, what people need to be thinking know, what people need to be thinking about as it relates to exploitation about as it relates to exploitation about as it relates to exploitation specifically. specifically. specifically. um we really focus on being as um we really focus on being as um we really focus on being as transparent as possible uh when we're transparent as possible uh when we're transparent as possible uh when we're talking about exploitation um and talking about exploitation um and talking about exploitation um and exploitation evidence. So, we're going exploitation evidence. So, we're going exploitation evidence. So, we're going to hop in uh uh to defining that a to hop in uh uh to defining that a to hop in uh uh to defining that a little bit as far as um how we're little bit as far as um how we're little bit as far as um how we're defining the research itself. Um uh I defining the research itself. Um uh I defining the research itself. Um uh I will emphasize too um we offer a free will emphasize too um we offer a free will emphasize too um we offer a free service. You can download all this data. service. You can download all this data. service. You can download all this data. You can go validate our research if you You can go validate our research if you You can go validate our research if you don't believe us. There's references for don't believe us. There's references for don't believe us. There's references for everything. Um, so I encourage you to do everything. Um, so I encourage you to do everything. Um, so I encourage you to do that as well. Uh, and it's always great that as well. Uh, and it's always great that as well. Uh, and it's always great to see other people's research, uh, with to see other people's research, uh, with to see other people's research, uh, with the exploitation data. Um, as it relates the exploitation data. Um, as it relates the exploitation data. Um, as it relates to vulnerabilities, to vulnerabilities, to vulnerabilities, um, uh, this threat matrix, um, uh, um, uh, this threat matrix, um, uh, um, uh, this threat matrix, um, uh, really outlines, um, uh, a view, uh, really outlines, um, uh, a view, uh, really outlines, um, uh, a view, uh, from a threat perspective. Uh, and so if from a threat perspective. Uh, and so if from a threat perspective. Uh, and so if you look at the tip of the spear, uh, you look at the tip of the spear, uh, you look at the tip of the spear, uh, most of what we'll be talking about most of what we'll be talking about most of what we'll be talking about today is known exploited today is known exploited today is known exploited vulnerabilities. Um there's different vulnerabilities. Um there's different vulnerabilities. Um there's different ways those can get categorized. Um and ways those can get categorized. Um and ways those can get categorized. Um and specifically often you see things like specifically often you see things like specifically often you see things like ransomware, botnet, uh thread actor ransomware, botnet, uh thread actor ransomware, botnet, uh thread actor attribution um really as things to attribution um really as things to attribution um really as things to prioritize quick tip of the spear. Uh prioritize quick tip of the spear. Uh prioritize quick tip of the spear. Uh and then you have um known exploitation and then you have um known exploitation and then you have um known exploitation that doesn't necessarily have that doesn't necessarily have that doesn't necessarily have attribution attribution attribution um uh as well. So we will hop a little um uh as well. So we will hop a little um uh as well. So we will hop a little bit into ransomware, but we're going to bit into ransomware, but we're going to bit into ransomware, but we're going to look at that full dark red and uh pink look at that full dark red and uh pink look at that full dark red and uh pink triangle. Um below that when we're triangle. Um below that when we're triangle. Um below that when we're looking at a threat matrix um weaponized looking at a threat matrix um weaponized looking at a threat matrix um weaponized vulnerabilities so these are typically vulnerabilities so these are typically vulnerabilities so these are typically vulnerabilities uh in tools like vulnerabilities uh in tools like vulnerabilities uh in tools like metas-ploit um core logic uh and other metas-ploit um core logic uh and other metas-ploit um core logic uh and other uh often uh exploit kits are commercial uh often uh exploit kits are commercial uh often uh exploit kits are commercial tools and then you have proof of concept tools and then you have proof of concept tools and then you have proof of concept code right um and then a lot most code right um and then a lot most code right um and then a lot most vulnerabilities don't have any of these vulnerabilities don't have any of these vulnerabilities don't have any of these things um uh well I shouldn't say don't things um uh well I shouldn't say don't things um uh well I shouldn't say don't have any of these things but um there's have any of these things but um there's have any of these things but um there's not necessarily evidence associated with not necessarily evidence associated with not necessarily evidence associated with them uh would be the right way to to say them uh would be the right way to to say them uh would be the right way to to say that um when I'm talking about known that um when I'm talking about known that um when I'm talking about known exploited vulnerabilities I want to make exploited vulnerabilities I want to make exploited vulnerabilities I want to make this very clear I am not just talking this very clear I am not just talking this very clear I am not just talking about sysv about sysv about sysv uh everything I'm talking about is uh everything I'm talking about is uh everything I'm talking about is inclusive of sysv inclusive of sysv inclusive of sysv um and I will show some uh uh like um and I will show some uh uh like um and I will show some uh uh like comparisons around that as well um and comparisons around that as well um and comparisons around that as well um and sisa does a great job like they're like sisa does a great job like they're like sisa does a great job like they're like this year even looking like they're this year even looking like they're this year even looking like they're kicking off some real intel we're not kicking off some real intel we're not kicking off some real intel we're not you know not necessarily seeing other you know not necessarily seeing other you know not necessarily seeing other places so uh it is one of many sources places so uh it is one of many sources places so uh it is one of many sources which I'll talk about uh regarding which I'll talk about uh regarding which I'll talk about uh regarding exploitation uh exploitation uh exploitation uh evidence. So great job. How we're evidence. So great job. How we're evidence. So great job. How we're defining known exploited defining known exploited defining known exploited vulnerabilities. So uh we include any vulnerabilities. So uh we include any vulnerabilities. So uh we include any vulnerability uh that we find publicly vulnerability uh that we find publicly vulnerability uh that we find publicly reported as exploited in the wild. We do reported as exploited in the wild. We do reported as exploited in the wild. We do this as a free service um uh API access. this as a free service um uh API access. this as a free service um uh API access. Anyone can access it. We ask for Anyone can access it. We ask for Anyone can access it. We ask for attribution. Um but first off, you know, attribution. Um but first off, you know, attribution. Um but first off, you know, we identify trusted sources. We're very we identify trusted sources. We're very we identify trusted sources. We're very careful of just automating um everything careful of just automating um everything careful of just automating um everything and everything that says it's exploited and everything that says it's exploited and everything that says it's exploited or feeds. I audit feeds a lot of times. or feeds. I audit feeds a lot of times. or feeds. I audit feeds a lot of times. My team audits feeds. Large majority of My team audits feeds. Large majority of My team audits feeds. Large majority of time there's a lot of false positives. time there's a lot of false positives. time there's a lot of false positives. Um when we're talking about different Um when we're talking about different Um when we're talking about different different um uh nonexloited different um uh nonexloited different um uh nonexloited vulnerabilities, things like not vulnerabilities, things like not vulnerabilities, things like not exploited in the wild because it's based exploited in the wild because it's based exploited in the wild because it's based on text. Um and so we automate things um on text. Um and so we automate things um on text. Um and so we automate things um that are reliable uh um that we can sisv that are reliable uh um that we can sisv that are reliable uh um that we can sisv is a good example of that. Uh project is a good example of that. Uh project is a good example of that. Uh project zero um uh shadow server uh shout out to zero um uh shadow server uh shout out to zero um uh shadow server uh shout out to them. I'll talk a little bit about that. them. I'll talk a little bit about that. them. I'll talk a little bit about that. And then Microsoft MSRC discloses a lot And then Microsoft MSRC discloses a lot And then Microsoft MSRC discloses a lot of exploitation evidence on their um of exploitation evidence on their um of exploitation evidence on their um advisories and uh on especially around advisories and uh on especially around advisories and uh on especially around patch Tuesday which is great great patch Tuesday which is great great patch Tuesday which is great great example um of a vendor uh providing that example um of a vendor uh providing that example um of a vendor uh providing that and encourage others to as well. In and encourage others to as well. In and encourage others to as well. In addition to that we automate um addition to that we automate um addition to that we automate um collection uh from uh hundreds and collection uh from uh hundreds and collection uh from uh hundreds and hundreds of different sources. I will hundreds of different sources. I will hundreds of different sources. I will tell you um we get pinged daily. Like tell you um we get pinged daily. Like tell you um we get pinged daily. Like this morning I got pinged on LinkedIn this morning I got pinged on LinkedIn this morning I got pinged on LinkedIn with four different reports of with four different reports of with four different reports of exploitation. We ask that everyone exploitation. We ask that everyone exploitation. We ask that everyone discloses the exploitation publicly for discloses the exploitation publicly for discloses the exploitation publicly for a reason. Like it helps everybody. So uh a reason. Like it helps everybody. So uh a reason. Like it helps everybody. So uh it is really cool to see the impact of it is really cool to see the impact of it is really cool to see the impact of more and more organizations, researchers more and more organizations, researchers more and more organizations, researchers uh and people doing that. Um uh and I uh and people doing that. Um uh and I uh and people doing that. Um uh and I get links in my inbox all the time and get links in my inbox all the time and get links in my inbox all the time and and and uh uh you know really cool to and and uh uh you know really cool to and and uh uh you know really cool to see so we can help uh defenders get see so we can help uh defenders get see so we can help uh defenders get early visibility into early visibility into early visibility into exploitation. Um some other important exploitation. Um some other important exploitation. Um some other important details like we're really talking about details like we're really talking about details like we're really talking about emerging threat. These are things that emerging threat. These are things that emerging threat. These are things that are coming fast. Uh there's people are coming fast. Uh there's people are coming fast. Uh there's people disclosing uh known disclosing uh known disclosing uh known exploitation. Um uh so I think of them exploitation. Um uh so I think of them exploitation. Um uh so I think of them as emerging threat. Uh the evidence is as emerging threat. Uh the evidence is as emerging threat. Uh the evidence is all public records. So you don't have to all public records. So you don't have to all public records. So you don't have to trust me. Uh like you can go look for trust me. Uh like you can go look for trust me. Uh like you can go look for yourself if you want. Uh you can do yourself if you want. Uh you can do yourself if you want. Uh you can do research for yourself. Uh there's a lot research for yourself. Uh there's a lot research for yourself. Uh there's a lot of different researchers uh that have of different researchers uh that have of different researchers uh that have leveraged the data set as well. Um if leveraged the data set as well. Um if leveraged the data set as well. Um if there's no CVE, we are a CNA. Uh so we there's no CVE, we are a CNA. Uh so we there's no CVE, we are a CNA. Uh so we work the best way possible to coordinate work the best way possible to coordinate work the best way possible to coordinate getting a CVE timely. Uh many of the getting a CVE timely. Uh many of the getting a CVE timely. Uh many of the CNAs uh we have interacted with you um CNAs uh we have interacted with you um CNAs uh we have interacted with you um at times uh with coordinated disclosure. at times uh with coordinated disclosure. at times uh with coordinated disclosure. um uh and we work closely with a lot of um uh and we work closely with a lot of um uh and we work closely with a lot of different intel firms that don't want to different intel firms that don't want to different intel firms that don't want to be a CNA. Um uh uh have lots of be a CNA. Um uh uh have lots of be a CNA. Um uh uh have lots of different relationships there. And if different relationships there. And if different relationships there. And if you want to look at our security you want to look at our security you want to look at our security advisories, you can um you can probably advisories, you can um you can probably advisories, you can um you can probably derive who some of those are. Um there's derive who some of those are. Um there's derive who some of those are. Um there's many different ways people define many different ways people define many different ways people define exploitation. That's fine. Uh I think exploitation. That's fine. Uh I think exploitation. That's fine. Uh I think whole purpose of what I just said is to whole purpose of what I just said is to whole purpose of what I just said is to help provide clarity in what I'm help provide clarity in what I'm help provide clarity in what I'm referring to as it relates to known referring to as it relates to known referring to as it relates to known exploited exploited exploited vulnerabilities. So uh 2024 um from a vulnerabilities. So uh 2024 um from a vulnerabilities. So uh 2024 um from a disclosure perspective we're talking disclosure perspective we're talking disclosure perspective we're talking about vulnerabilities that had about vulnerabilities that had about vulnerabilities that had exploitation evidence publicly disclosed exploitation evidence publicly disclosed exploitation evidence publicly disclosed for the first time in 2024. Um there's for the first time in 2024. Um there's for the first time in 2024. Um there's over 800. Um I did publish a blog at the over 800. Um I did publish a blog at the over 800. Um I did publish a blog at the beginning of the year. uh we collect in beginning of the year. uh we collect in beginning of the year. uh we collect in evidence continually and sometimes evidence continually and sometimes evidence continually and sometimes there's evidence that pops up that's there's evidence that pops up that's there's evidence that pops up that's predate so that's a higher number than predate so that's a higher number than predate so that's a higher number than uh what we posted right away. Um we try uh what we posted right away. Um we try uh what we posted right away. Um we try and get research out quick. Uh so that's and get research out quick. Uh so that's and get research out quick. Uh so that's a real reality and we try and be honest a real reality and we try and be honest a real reality and we try and be honest about it. Um there's over 2,000 uh known about it. Um there's over 2,000 uh known about it. Um there's over 2,000 uh known exploited reference citations with this exploited reference citations with this exploited reference citations with this 100 plus unique sources. And uh I'm 100 plus unique sources. And uh I'm 100 plus unique sources. And uh I'm going to hop into no uh ransomware a going to hop into no uh ransomware a going to hop into no uh ransomware a little bit. There's 53 vulnerabilities little bit. There's 53 vulnerabilities little bit. There's 53 vulnerabilities with known ransomware. And the dates with known ransomware. And the dates with known ransomware. And the dates that we're using for this is when that we're using for this is when that we're using for this is when evidence was first evidence was first evidence was first published. Now um earliest reported published. Now um earliest reported published. Now um earliest reported sources there is some bias in this data sources there is some bias in this data sources there is some bias in this data as well. Like two things I will point as well. Like two things I will point as well. Like two things I will point out. Uh we onboarded shadow server um uh out. Uh we onboarded shadow server um uh out. Uh we onboarded shadow server um uh to automatically ingest uh 2023 that ran to automatically ingest uh 2023 that ran to automatically ingest uh 2023 that ran into 2024. So the bubble is a little bit into 2024. So the bubble is a little bit into 2024. So the bubble is a little bit inflated as far as the the numbers from inflated as far as the the numbers from inflated as far as the the numbers from that. The other thing is like I worked that. The other thing is like I worked that. The other thing is like I worked in coordination um on some WordPress in coordination um on some WordPress in coordination um on some WordPress plugins that had exploitation and did plugins that had exploitation and did plugins that had exploitation and did not have CVES and with that CNA. So of not have CVES and with that CNA. So of not have CVES and with that CNA. So of course when you do that that's going to course when you do that that's going to course when you do that that's going to uh increase the bubble size of some of uh increase the bubble size of some of uh increase the bubble size of some of these as well. Um and it's awesome to these as well. Um and it's awesome to these as well. Um and it's awesome to work with with uh some of those folks work with with uh some of those folks work with with uh some of those folks too. So I think there was somewhere too. So I think there was somewhere too. So I think there was somewhere around like I don't know 62 WordPress around like I don't know 62 WordPress around like I don't know 62 WordPress plugins that were being exploited um uh plugins that were being exploited um uh plugins that were being exploited um uh specifically that we worked to get CNAs specifically that we worked to get CNAs specifically that we worked to get CNAs through uh that have that scope. Um, through uh that have that scope. Um, through uh that have that scope. Um, sorry I'm going fast. The one thing I sorry I'm going fast. The one thing I sorry I'm going fast. The one thing I want to point out here is like there are want to point out here is like there are want to point out here is like there are vendors disclosing exploitation which is vendors disclosing exploitation which is vendors disclosing exploitation which is great. And I think the the sysv um great. And I think the the sysv um great. And I think the the sysv um there's kind of like a uh sometimes a there's kind of like a uh sometimes a there's kind of like a uh sometimes a little bit of maybe race condition as little bit of maybe race condition as little bit of maybe race condition as far as dates uh when you have um patch far as dates uh when you have um patch far as dates uh when you have um patch Tuesday or other things where disclosure Tuesday or other things where disclosure Tuesday or other things where disclosure happens on the same day. Um but you know happens on the same day. Um but you know happens on the same day. Um but you know Microsoft on MSRC discloses a lot. They Microsoft on MSRC discloses a lot. They Microsoft on MSRC discloses a lot. They also have security research, but the also have security research, but the also have security research, but the large majority of of these organizations large majority of of these organizations large majority of of these organizations disclosing exploitation disclosing exploitation disclosing exploitation um are security um are security um are security researchers uh um as far as where the researchers uh um as far as where the researchers uh um as far as where the evidence is coming from. Um there there evidence is coming from. Um there there evidence is coming from. Um there there there are and I'm not going to be able there are and I'm not going to be able there are and I'm not going to be able to name them all, but like uh it's great to name them all, but like uh it's great to name them all, but like uh it's great Google's uh uh disclosing exploitation, Google's uh uh disclosing exploitation, Google's uh uh disclosing exploitation, Apple, um uh Cisco, uh there's a bunch. Apple, um uh Cisco, uh there's a bunch. Apple, um uh Cisco, uh there's a bunch. Um, and so I really, one of the things I Um, and so I really, one of the things I Um, and so I really, one of the things I want to do here is like really encourage want to do here is like really encourage want to do here is like really encourage if you're a CNA or a vendor, if you're a CNA or a vendor, if you're a CNA or a vendor, uh, when there's evidence of uh, when there's evidence of uh, when there's evidence of exploitation, um, it is really helpful, exploitation, um, it is really helpful, exploitation, um, it is really helpful, really helpful for the defenders because really helpful for the defenders because really helpful for the defenders because they know it's really important. There's they know it's really important. There's they know it's really important. There's a few different ways you can do this. a few different ways you can do this. a few different ways you can do this. Um, uh, you can disclose there's Um, uh, you can disclose there's Um, uh, you can disclose there's evidence of exploitation in an your own evidence of exploitation in an your own evidence of exploitation in an your own advisories. advisories. advisories. Um you can do it on the CVE record like Um you can do it on the CVE record like Um you can do it on the CVE record like often exploited in the wild this date. often exploited in the wild this date. often exploited in the wild this date. Uh you see that on a lot of different Uh you see that on a lot of different Uh you see that on a lot of different records uh oh or sorry description and records uh oh or sorry description and records uh oh or sorry description and then um if you're using like vonogram or then um if you're using like vonogram or then um if you're using like vonogram or if you even automate this in vonogram if you even automate this in vonogram if you even automate this in vonogram there's a tag for nonexploited there's a tag for nonexploited there's a tag for nonexploited vulnerability as well. It just provides vulnerability as well. It just provides vulnerability as well. It just provides a discovery uh so anyone and everyone a discovery uh so anyone and everyone a discovery uh so anyone and everyone can find these things and have the can find these things and have the can find these things and have the information that this stuff is really information that this stuff is really information that this stuff is really important urgent to fix. Um so let's important urgent to fix. Um so let's important urgent to fix. Um so let's take a quick look. um and some examples take a quick look. um and some examples take a quick look. um and some examples of known exploited vulnerabilities. And of known exploited vulnerabilities. And of known exploited vulnerabilities. And what I want to talk a little about too what I want to talk a little about too what I want to talk a little about too is like the you know information that's is like the you know information that's is like the you know information that's flowing. Um and so I have two examples. flowing. Um and so I have two examples. flowing. Um and so I have two examples. Uh I they're ones I did last year. I Uh I they're ones I did last year. I Uh I they're ones I did last year. I just picked them out of random. Um but just picked them out of random. Um but just picked them out of random. Um but it gives you some idea as far as uh uh it gives you some idea as far as uh uh it gives you some idea as far as uh uh reporting um uh and information that's reporting um uh and information that's reporting um uh and information that's flowing. So the first one um this is a flowing. So the first one um this is a flowing. So the first one um this is a and I was like oh I'm pretty sure this and I was like oh I'm pretty sure this and I was like oh I'm pretty sure this was early 20 24 hopefully I didn't get was early 20 24 hopefully I didn't get was early 20 24 hopefully I didn't get this wrong um uh so I I grabbed this this wrong um uh so I I grabbed this this wrong um uh so I I grabbed this from uh earlier last year but uh you from uh earlier last year but uh you from uh earlier last year but uh you have an example where very quickly you have an example where very quickly you have an example where very quickly you have someone like defer report which is have someone like defer report which is have someone like defer report which is a trusted source reporting exploitation a trusted source reporting exploitation a trusted source reporting exploitation you have shadow server honeypotss now you have shadow server honeypotss now you have shadow server honeypotss now kicking off exploitation you have GitHub kicking off exploitation you have GitHub kicking off exploitation you have GitHub exploits being issued um you know SANS exploits being issued um you know SANS exploits being issued um you know SANS then comments that they're seeing then comments that they're seeing then comments that they're seeing exploitation confirmed confirmed uh uh exploitation confirmed confirmed uh uh exploitation confirmed confirmed uh uh you have Kellyn at rapid 7 on X uh you have Kellyn at rapid 7 on X uh you have Kellyn at rapid 7 on X uh posting that there's exploitation. So posting that there's exploitation. So posting that there's exploitation. So there's just a lot of different sources there's just a lot of different sources there's just a lot of different sources and and you know January 21st and then and and you know January 21st and then and and you know January 21st and then it gets added to sysv um and it's an it gets added to sysv um and it's an it gets added to sysv um and it's an example on the 24th and there's a due example on the 24th and there's a due example on the 24th and there's a due date for the 14th um so this is just date for the 14th um so this is just date for the 14th um so this is just good example of different places good example of different places good example of different places different organizations for guard very different organizations for guard very different organizations for guard very common uh with fordinet disclosing common uh with fordinet disclosing common uh with fordinet disclosing exploitation uh teneal um and perva uh exploitation uh teneal um and perva uh exploitation uh teneal um and perva uh uh you know confirming that they're uh you know confirming that they're uh you know confirming that they're seeing these things uh and publishing seeing these things uh and publishing seeing these things uh and publishing research about it. Another uh example I research about it. Another uh example I research about it. Another uh example I want to provide and and I am going to want to provide and and I am going to want to provide and and I am going to get a little bit into scoring. Um uh and get a little bit into scoring. Um uh and get a little bit into scoring. Um uh and so I I did outline this one. Um this is so I I did outline this one. Um this is so I I did outline this one. Um this is a Microsoft Windows vulnerability. a Microsoft Windows vulnerability. a Microsoft Windows vulnerability. Microsoft issued uh a vulnerability in Microsoft issued uh a vulnerability in Microsoft issued uh a vulnerability in June. Um there's some exploit June. Um there's some exploit June. Um there's some exploit availability. I kind of mentioned availability. I kind of mentioned availability. I kind of mentioned earlier uh like weaponized exploits like earlier uh like weaponized exploits like earlier uh like weaponized exploits like metas-ploit modules tend to be an metas-ploit modules tend to be an metas-ploit modules tend to be an indicator that uh there's likely to be indicator that uh there's likely to be indicator that uh there's likely to be exploitation. There's more public exploitation. There's more public exploitation. There's more public exploits in GitHub. Um, and then this exploits in GitHub. Um, and then this exploits in GitHub. Um, and then this ends up being on ends up being on ends up being on sysv. Um, I I did this one in January sysv. Um, I I did this one in January sysv. Um, I I did this one in January and and I'm going to talk about scoring and and I'm going to talk about scoring and and I'm going to talk about scoring a little bit. Um, but there's some a little bit. Um, but there's some a little bit. Um, but there's some positives here and then there's just positives here and then there's just positives here and then there's just some observations about the score some observations about the score some observations about the score itself. Um, I'm not going to get into itself. Um, I'm not going to get into itself. Um, I'm not going to get into how EPSS works, but generally speaking, how EPSS works, but generally speaking, how EPSS works, but generally speaking, it's like this is really bad indications it's like this is really bad indications it's like this is really bad indications that something should be fixed. Um uh it that something should be fixed. Um uh it that something should be fixed. Um uh it does show like with a new version that does show like with a new version that does show like with a new version that was just released a few weeks ago, it was just released a few weeks ago, it was just released a few weeks ago, it got rescored and suddenly it's high. Um got rescored and suddenly it's high. Um got rescored and suddenly it's high. Um uh and so I'll talk a little bit more uh and so I'll talk a little bit more uh and so I'll talk a little bit more about scoring, but I wanted to just about scoring, but I wanted to just about scoring, but I wanted to just highlight uh this example as far as u highlight uh this example as far as u highlight uh this example as far as u you know exploit availability, you know exploit availability, you know exploit availability, weaponization to known exploitation. Uh weaponization to known exploitation. Uh weaponization to known exploitation. Uh that's helpful for the defenders um so that's helpful for the defenders um so that's helpful for the defenders um so they can take action on also temporal they can take action on also temporal they can take action on also temporal score 7.8. So we can talk a little bit score 7.8. So we can talk a little bit score 7.8. So we can talk a little bit about scoring in a second. Um the other about scoring in a second. Um the other about scoring in a second. Um the other thing uh I want to talk about is um what thing uh I want to talk about is um what thing uh I want to talk about is um what can we learn about volume and frequency can we learn about volume and frequency can we learn about volume and frequency um and I'm doing a comparison with this um and I'm doing a comparison with this um and I'm doing a comparison with this right? So up top we see um all the known right? So up top we see um all the known right? So up top we see um all the known exploited vulnerabilities that we have exploited vulnerabilities that we have exploited vulnerabilities that we have evidence for and then we have evidence for and then we have evidence for and then we have sysv sysv is a federal scope. It was not sysv sysv is a federal scope. It was not sysv sysv is a federal scope. It was not designed for enterprises or designed for enterprises or designed for enterprises or organizations in different parts of the organizations in different parts of the organizations in different parts of the world. Um, and so just to emphasize, world. Um, and so just to emphasize, world. Um, and so just to emphasize, it's like it is a great resource. it's like it is a great resource. it's like it is a great resource. There's real intel coming off that you There's real intel coming off that you There's real intel coming off that you should fix that stuff. Um, there's often should fix that stuff. Um, there's often should fix that stuff. Um, there's often earlier indicators in other places uh earlier indicators in other places uh earlier indicators in other places uh that there's known exploitation. Um, and that there's known exploitation. Um, and that there's known exploitation. Um, and so there's different processes. Uh, but so there's different processes. Uh, but so there's different processes. Uh, but from a capacity perspective, um, I like from a capacity perspective, um, I like from a capacity perspective, um, I like to look at, hey, what you know, what are to look at, hey, what you know, what are to look at, hey, what you know, what are we seeing from a disclosure perspective we seeing from a disclosure perspective we seeing from a disclosure perspective on the exploitation side? Gives you a on the exploitation side? Gives you a on the exploitation side? Gives you a good example. It's just about every day good example. It's just about every day good example. It's just about every day you get a few breaks here and there. um you get a few breaks here and there. um you get a few breaks here and there. um there's new disclosures of exploitation there's new disclosures of exploitation there's new disclosures of exploitation happening. Um and on the defense side, happening. Um and on the defense side, happening. Um and on the defense side, that's really important because that that's really important because that that's really important because that helps you capacity plan because these helps you capacity plan because these helps you capacity plan because these are typically things you have to respond are typically things you have to respond are typically things you have to respond to quick or fast. If I break that over months, fast. If I break that over months, fast. If I break that over months, right? Um I kind of mentioned early on right? Um I kind of mentioned early on right? Um I kind of mentioned early on shadow server is is popped high. Um so shadow server is is popped high. Um so shadow server is is popped high. Um so that's more of anomaly. Um but if you're that's more of anomaly. Um but if you're that's more of anomaly. Um but if you're capacity planning, right, it's we should capacity planning, right, it's we should capacity planning, right, it's we should have some some people available. Um, have some some people available. Um, have some some people available. Um, these could be different technologies these could be different technologies these could be different technologies that run these things down to see if that run these things down to see if that run these things down to see if we're impacted and if we're patched, we're impacted and if we're patched, we're impacted and if we're patched, right? Uh, pretty simple, pretty right? Uh, pretty simple, pretty right? Uh, pretty simple, pretty straightforward. Um, uh, usually straightforward. Um, uh, usually straightforward. Um, uh, usually requires a sense of requires a sense of requires a sense of urgency. Now, the next thing I think urgency. Now, the next thing I think urgency. Now, the next thing I think about is how do we categorize these about is how do we categorize these about is how do we categorize these things to help people understand, um, things to help people understand, um, things to help people understand, um, where to focus efforts on. So, I where to focus efforts on. So, I where to focus efforts on. So, I manually categorize in an Excel manually categorize in an Excel manually categorize in an Excel spreadsheet. Uh but I I created um in spreadsheet. Uh but I I created um in spreadsheet. Uh but I I created um in this case um all the known exploited this case um all the known exploited this case um all the known exploited vulnerabilities vulnerabilities vulnerabilities uh and break them down by different uh and break them down by different uh and break them down by different categories and I I am for this categories and I I am for this categories and I I am for this discussion going to like remove some of discussion going to like remove some of discussion going to like remove some of the data to see the chart on the main the data to see the chart on the main the data to see the chart on the main stuff because content management systems stuff because content management systems stuff because content management systems particularly WordPress plugins um are particularly WordPress plugins um are particularly WordPress plugins um are really really exploited um uh uh high really really exploited um uh uh high really really exploited um uh uh high target one of the most pervasive target one of the most pervasive target one of the most pervasive technologies uh it's on on the internet technologies uh it's on on the internet technologies uh it's on on the internet you make sure you have compensating you make sure you have compensating you make sure you have compensating controls. You should make sure your controls. You should make sure your controls. You should make sure your plugins are update, you prune the plugins are update, you prune the plugins are update, you prune the plugins, all that fun stuff. But I think plugins, all that fun stuff. But I think plugins, all that fun stuff. But I think it's interesting if I take those away. it's interesting if I take those away. it's interesting if I take those away. Um get a little bit focused intimate on Um get a little bit focused intimate on Um get a little bit focused intimate on the um enterprise organization. And so the um enterprise organization. And so the um enterprise organization. And so how I think of these different how I think of these different how I think of these different categories is is these are target areas categories is is these are target areas categories is is these are target areas that you should be thinking about uh that you should be thinking about uh that you should be thinking about uh ensuring that you have quick patch ensuring that you have quick patch ensuring that you have quick patch processes. They also typically align processes. They also typically align processes. They also typically align with different teams across an with different teams across an with different teams across an enterprise organization and they might enterprise organization and they might enterprise organization and they might or might not be internet connected or or might not be internet connected or or might not be internet connected or user connected. user connected. user connected. So um that's where my mind goes is uh So um that's where my mind goes is uh So um that's where my mind goes is uh you have network edge devices many you have network edge devices many you have network edge devices many different technologies um and these different technologies um and these different technologies um and these vendors will change from year to year uh vendors will change from year to year uh vendors will change from year to year uh what we this will be a different set of what we this will be a different set of what we this will be a different set of vendors a number of CVEes um but but vendors a number of CVEes um but but vendors a number of CVEes um but but initial access devices are things you initial access devices are things you initial access devices are things you should make sure they're not end of life should make sure they're not end of life should make sure they're not end of life they get patched quickly um uh you have they get patched quickly um uh you have they get patched quickly um uh you have great mitigating controls in place you great mitigating controls in place you great mitigating controls in place you have operating systems so you you know have operating systems so you you know have operating systems so you you know patch processes there patch Tuesday is patch processes there patch Tuesday is patch processes there patch Tuesday is great helps defenders uh patch broadly. great helps defenders uh patch broadly. great helps defenders uh patch broadly. um uh mitigating controls like EDR. Um um uh mitigating controls like EDR. Um um uh mitigating controls like EDR. Um but really like yeah I think it's but really like yeah I think it's but really like yeah I think it's interesting like looking at different interesting like looking at different interesting like looking at different scopes of categories like open source scopes of categories like open source scopes of categories like open source software that's going to be your software that's going to be your software that's going to be your application developers often that really application developers often that really application developers often that really care about that and looking at the care about that and looking at the care about that and looking at the technologies that have exploitation technologies that have exploitation technologies that have exploitation within that to say do we have these within that to say do we have these within that to say do we have these types of technologies we probably should types of technologies we probably should types of technologies we probably should ensure we have some sort of process for ensure we have some sort of process for ensure we have some sort of process for emerging threat emerging threat emerging threat um ransomware uh trying to be mindful of um ransomware uh trying to be mindful of um ransomware uh trying to be mindful of time um and I'll make these all time um and I'll make these all time um and I'll make these all available afterwards but this is kind of available afterwards but this is kind of available afterwards but this is kind of the stuff that goes through my mind to the stuff that goes through my mind to the stuff that goes through my mind to help defenders um uh you know think hey help defenders um uh you know think hey help defenders um uh you know think hey where do we focus on from a technology where do we focus on from a technology where do we focus on from a technology perspective mitigating controls and such perspective mitigating controls and such perspective mitigating controls and such um uh patch processes uh on the um uh patch processes uh on the um uh patch processes uh on the ransomware side as I mentioned I think I ransomware side as I mentioned I think I ransomware side as I mentioned I think I said 52 sorry I didn't put in the notes said 52 sorry I didn't put in the notes said 52 sorry I didn't put in the notes um uh uh but um ransomware association um uh uh but um ransomware association um uh uh but um ransomware association is a small portion um and it also a lot is a small portion um and it also a lot is a small portion um and it also a lot of times happens later on in in the life of times happens later on in in the life of times happens later on in in the life cycle but generally speaking uh for cycle but generally speaking uh for cycle but generally speaking uh for enterprise organizations, ransomware is enterprise organizations, ransomware is enterprise organizations, ransomware is often a top concern to organizations often a top concern to organizations often a top concern to organizations from a target perspective. Um so from a target perspective. Um so from a target perspective. Um so similarly like different technologies um similarly like different technologies um similarly like different technologies um network edge devices, initial devices um network edge devices, initial devices um network edge devices, initial devices um uh open source technologies, uh open source technologies, uh open source technologies, virtualization technologies, uh backups, virtualization technologies, uh backups, virtualization technologies, uh backups, email um uh you see the content email um uh you see the content email um uh you see the content management bubble shrink very quickly. management bubble shrink very quickly. management bubble shrink very quickly. Um the I will say though the content Um the I will say though the content Um the I will say though the content management piece I've seen in campaigns management piece I've seen in campaigns management piece I've seen in campaigns like Blackbasta where they're targeting like Blackbasta where they're targeting like Blackbasta where they're targeting WordPress plugins that uh have email WordPress plugins that uh have email WordPress plugins that uh have email services. So then they can use that for services. So then they can use that for services. So then they can use that for fishing campaigns, right? Um so uh you fishing campaigns, right? Um so uh you fishing campaigns, right? Um so uh you know different dynamics to think about know different dynamics to think about know different dynamics to think about uh as it relates to technology in the uh as it relates to technology in the uh as it relates to technology in the defender stack. Uh if that's helpful to defender stack. Uh if that's helpful to defender stack. Uh if that's helpful to know. know. know. Um I think the last thing uh I have is Um I think the last thing uh I have is Um I think the last thing uh I have is I'm going to talk a little bit about I'm going to talk a little bit about I'm going to talk a little bit about vulnerability scoring systems. Um and I vulnerability scoring systems. Um and I vulnerability scoring systems. Um and I this is as it pertains to emerging this is as it pertains to emerging this is as it pertains to emerging threat. So keep that in mind when I'm threat. So keep that in mind when I'm threat. So keep that in mind when I'm I'm sharing this information. Um but I I'm sharing this information. Um but I I'm sharing this information. Um but I also think there's some opportunity also think there's some opportunity also think there's some opportunity uh for improvement um uh for people uh for improvement um uh for people uh for improvement um uh for people using different scoring systems. Um the using different scoring systems. Um the using different scoring systems. Um the the first thing you know if we look at the first thing you know if we look at the first thing you know if we look at known exploited vulnerabilities known exploited vulnerabilities known exploited vulnerabilities uh if we look at the severity of known uh if we look at the severity of known uh if we look at the severity of known exploited vulnerabilities exploited vulnerabilities exploited vulnerabilities um the distribution is pretty similar to um the distribution is pretty similar to um the distribution is pretty similar to what you would see when you see all what you would see when you see all what you would see when you see all vulnerabilities. What was that? Yes. Um vulnerabilities. What was that? Yes. Um vulnerabilities. What was that? Yes. Um and this is uh I say CVSSB but these are and this is uh I say CVSSB but these are and this is uh I say CVSSB but these are all exploited. Um, and so you see a all exploited. Um, and so you see a all exploited. Um, and so you see a distribution of critical, high, medium, distribution of critical, high, medium, distribution of critical, high, medium, pretty normal wheel. Uh, not many low, pretty normal wheel. Uh, not many low, pretty normal wheel. Uh, not many low, some no scored because this is all some no scored because this is all some no scored because this is all public scores that we're using. If public scores that we're using. If public scores that we're using. If someone wants to talk about what someone wants to talk about what someone wants to talk about what version, uh, most of it's 3-1, but there version, uh, most of it's 3-1, but there version, uh, most of it's 3-1, but there is some blended. Um, happy to talk is some blended. Um, happy to talk is some blended. Um, happy to talk offline after. Um, and everyone keeps on offline after. Um, and everyone keeps on offline after. Um, and everyone keeps on saying just use saying just use saying just use BT. Well, does anyone know what that BT. Well, does anyone know what that BT. Well, does anyone know what that that circle looks like when you apply that circle looks like when you apply that circle looks like when you apply CVSSBT from a a severity perspective? CVSSBT from a a severity perspective? CVSSBT from a a severity perspective? It's the same exact thing. This does not It's the same exact thing. This does not It's the same exact thing. This does not help defenders. Like they're trying to help defenders. Like they're trying to help defenders. Like they're trying to prioritize and from a CVSs perspective, prioritize and from a CVSs perspective, prioritize and from a CVSs perspective, I think there's an opportunity here to I think there's an opportunity here to I think there's an opportunity here to change what we've done for the last 25 change what we've done for the last 25 change what we've done for the last 25 years. Um, this also applies to scoring. years. Um, this also applies to scoring. years. Um, this also applies to scoring. Um, I've worked on projects on CBSSBT. Um, I've worked on projects on CBSSBT. Um, I've worked on projects on CBSSBT. it marginally moves the needle for top it marginally moves the needle for top it marginally moves the needle for top scoring vulnerabilities to prioritize scoring vulnerabilities to prioritize scoring vulnerabilities to prioritize them at the top, but not particularly them at the top, but not particularly them at the top, but not particularly helpful. So, um I just Yeah, thanks for helpful. So, um I just Yeah, thanks for helpful. So, um I just Yeah, thanks for for calling that out. I think it's an for calling that out. I think it's an for calling that out. I think it's an opportunity to improve um and change the opportunity to improve um and change the opportunity to improve um and change the way we've done it um all the time way we've done it um all the time way we've done it um all the time because it's rather silly that we're because it's rather silly that we're because it's rather silly that we're signaling defenders to use BT and it signaling defenders to use BT and it signaling defenders to use BT and it really does not change severity for really does not change severity for really does not change severity for them. It it has a marginal impact from a them. It it has a marginal impact from a them. It it has a marginal impact from a score. And there's lots of other reports score. And there's lots of other reports score. And there's lots of other reports on that, but this is real exploit on that, but this is real exploit on that, but this is real exploit exploited vulnerabilities we're talking exploited vulnerabilities we're talking exploited vulnerabilities we're talking about from a data about from a data about from a data perspective. Um the the other question I perspective. Um the the other question I perspective. Um the the other question I wanted to ask is how much EPSS scoring wanted to ask is how much EPSS scoring wanted to ask is how much EPSS scoring improved with V4 for 2024 Kevs improved with V4 for 2024 Kevs improved with V4 for 2024 Kevs um uh the exploit prediction scoring um uh the exploit prediction scoring um uh the exploit prediction scoring system. system. system. So here is the uh on the So here is the uh on the So here is the uh on the uh bottom axis x-axis CVSS right and uh bottom axis x-axis CVSS right and uh bottom axis x-axis CVSS right and then on the top axis eps and I have some then on the top axis eps and I have some then on the top axis eps and I have some other slides but I want to make sure other slides but I want to make sure other slides but I want to make sure there's Q&amp;A from me in the last year I there's Q&amp;A from me in the last year I there's Q&amp;A from me in the last year I watched all the known exploited watched all the known exploited watched all the known exploited vulnerabilities and looked at all of vulnerabilities and looked at all of vulnerabilities and looked at all of them wondering why are eps scores so low them wondering why are eps scores so low them wondering why are eps scores so low when there's com evidence of known when there's com evidence of known when there's com evidence of known exploitation. Um, and to me that's exploitation. Um, and to me that's exploitation. Um, and to me that's challenging because I've worked a long challenging because I've worked a long challenging because I've worked a long time um and and trying to understand and time um and and trying to understand and time um and and trying to understand and pointing out examples uh continually and pointing out examples uh continually and pointing out examples uh continually and what I want to know is it's like okay we what I want to know is it's like okay we what I want to know is it's like okay we went a year we're using this V3 we there went a year we're using this V3 we there went a year we're using this V3 we there was a retraining right um it is 3 to 15 was a retraining right um it is 3 to 15 was a retraining right um it is 3 to 15 months after the fact of these things months after the fact of these things months after the fact of these things actually happening keep in mind um and actually happening keep in mind um and actually happening keep in mind um and if we look at V4 what it tells us is yes if we look at V4 what it tells us is yes if we look at V4 what it tells us is yes like with a new model retraining for like with a new model retraining for like with a new model retraining for last year's vulnerabilities and made it last year's vulnerabilities and made it last year's vulnerabilities and made it better. Um, I think there's some things better. Um, I think there's some things better. Um, I think there's some things in the work to like retrain more often. in the work to like retrain more often. in the work to like retrain more often. Uh, it's really hard to see if V4 is any Uh, it's really hard to see if V4 is any Uh, it's really hard to see if V4 is any better because we need time like to see better because we need time like to see better because we need time like to see and observe to see if it's actually and observe to see if it's actually and observe to see if it's actually going to catch the stuff over the next going to catch the stuff over the next going to catch the stuff over the next year as it relates to known exploited year as it relates to known exploited year as it relates to known exploited vulnerabilities. But what this tells me vulnerabilities. But what this tells me vulnerabilities. But what this tells me is yeah, that known exploitation is yeah, that known exploitation is yeah, that known exploitation evidence was actually real and EPSS is evidence was actually real and EPSS is evidence was actually real and EPSS is now confirming that with with uh the now confirming that with with uh the now confirming that with with uh the training adjustments from a score training adjustments from a score training adjustments from a score perspective. Um and so you know really perspective. Um and so you know really perspective. Um and so you know really uh from an emerging threat perspective uh from an emerging threat perspective uh from an emerging threat perspective and known exploited vulnerabilities like and known exploited vulnerabilities like and known exploited vulnerabilities like really really important for the defender really really important for the defender really really important for the defender to use every and all evidence as to use every and all evidence as to use every and all evidence as possible. I have a few different um uh possible. I have a few different um uh possible. I have a few different um uh considerations from a defender considerations from a defender considerations from a defender perspective. perspective. perspective. um as a consumer and most consumers are um as a consumer and most consumers are um as a consumer and most consumers are not intimately knowledgeable on the not intimately knowledgeable on the not intimately knowledgeable on the limitations of scoring systems like this limitations of scoring systems like this limitations of scoring systems like this is a real reality. We keep on is a real reality. We keep on is a real reality. We keep on cheerleading scoring systems to solve cheerleading scoring systems to solve cheerleading scoring systems to solve problems for our customers. Um I think problems for our customers. Um I think problems for our customers. Um I think there is great work being done to try there is great work being done to try there is great work being done to try and improve them over time. Continue and improve them over time. Continue and improve them over time. Continue that. Hopefully this feedback is helpful that. Hopefully this feedback is helpful that. Hopefully this feedback is helpful for everyone involved in those. I think for everyone involved in those. I think for everyone involved in those. I think it's very dangerous um uh if we if we do it's very dangerous um uh if we if we do it's very dangerous um uh if we if we do not communicate properly the limitations not communicate properly the limitations not communicate properly the limitations of these scoring systems. Um I from an of these scoring systems. Um I from an of these scoring systems. Um I from an emerging threat perspective um uh I'm emerging threat perspective um uh I'm emerging threat perspective um uh I'm trying to think if there's anything else trying to think if there's anything else trying to think if there's anything else I was going to say in here. Um yeah, I I was going to say in here. Um yeah, I I was going to say in here. Um yeah, I said proceed with with caution. uh said proceed with with caution. uh said proceed with with caution. uh becoming in overly independent like if becoming in overly independent like if becoming in overly independent like if you don't have people continually you don't have people continually you don't have people continually monitoring and analyzing these things to monitoring and analyzing these things to monitoring and analyzing these things to see if they're working um uh properly uh see if they're working um uh properly uh see if they're working um uh properly uh and help prioritize things those are and help prioritize things those are and help prioritize things those are real challenges for the defenders um act real challenges for the defenders um act real challenges for the defenders um act on available exploitation evidence on available exploitation evidence on available exploitation evidence weaponization and other exploit evidence weaponization and other exploit evidence weaponization and other exploit evidence with a sense of urgency um and then I do with a sense of urgency um and then I do with a sense of urgency um and then I do highly recommend here um there are great highly recommend here um there are great highly recommend here um there are great components of CVSS EPSS has has great components of CVSS EPSS has has great components of CVSS EPSS has has great signal um there's framework works like signal um there's framework works like signal um there's framework works like SSVC uh and and risk based SSVC uh and and risk based SSVC uh and and risk based prioritization um that Chris Madden prioritization um that Chris Madden prioritization um that Chris Madden published that can help you put published that can help you put published that can help you put different components so that you can different components so that you can different components so that you can prioritize things properly. Um but prioritize things properly. Um but prioritize things properly. Um but particularly important like known particularly important like known particularly important like known exploitation, weaponization exploitation, weaponization exploitation, weaponization um really really important uh from a um really really important uh from a um really really important uh from a emerging threat perspective to emerging threat perspective to emerging threat perspective to prioritize. Um other considerations um prioritize. Um other considerations um prioritize. Um other considerations um from an emerging threat perspective uh from an emerging threat perspective uh from an emerging threat perspective uh you know I think a lot about rapid you know I think a lot about rapid you know I think a lot about rapid response internet facing and users are response internet facing and users are response internet facing and users are touching the devices and users love to touching the devices and users love to touching the devices and users love to click on links um remotely exploitable click on links um remotely exploitable click on links um remotely exploitable and then I do think that like that and then I do think that like that and then I do think that like that there's another aspect of this which is there's another aspect of this which is there's another aspect of this which is vulnerability debt right so most of the vulnerability debt right so most of the vulnerability debt right so most of the time I spent was on emerging threat but time I spent was on emerging threat but time I spent was on emerging threat but when you're talking about these large when you're talking about these large when you're talking about these large swasts of vulnerabilities ensuring that swasts of vulnerabilities ensuring that swasts of vulnerabilities ensuring that you're looking at root cause analysis you're looking at root cause analysis you're looking at root cause analysis improving patch management processes, improving patch management processes, improving patch management processes, implementing best practices. I know implementing best practices. I know implementing best practices. I know there's initiatives with a CV program, I there's initiatives with a CV program, I there's initiatives with a CV program, I think for end of life uh technology think for end of life uh technology think for end of life uh technology potentially, and making sure you're potentially, and making sure you're potentially, and making sure you're pruning and removing those um and then pruning and removing those um and then pruning and removing those um and then ensuring you're getting the right ensuring you're getting the right ensuring you're getting the right mitigating controls in place. So, mitigating controls in place. So, mitigating controls in place. So, uh with that being said, um uh you know, uh with that being said, um uh you know, uh with that being said, um uh you know, that's that's the talk uh pop up uh the that's that's the talk uh pop up uh the that's that's the talk uh pop up uh the threat matrix and uh appreciate I think threat matrix and uh appreciate I think threat matrix and uh appreciate I think we have four more minutes. Any we have four more minutes. Any we have four more minutes. Any questions? Let's go. Hi. So, I had a question about the Hi. So, I had a question about the Hi. So, I had a question about the CVSSBT. So, I am from Polter Networks. CVSSBT. So, I am from Polter Networks. CVSSBT. So, I am from Polter Networks. Um, we have started providing both CVSSB Um, we have started providing both CVSSB Um, we have started providing both CVSSB and BT scores for our CVES I think since and BT scores for our CVES I think since and BT scores for our CVES I think since Jan or Feb of this year. And we have Jan or Feb of this year. And we have Jan or Feb of this year. And we have seen that if when you know BT provides seen that if when you know BT provides seen that if when you know BT provides you different ways where it says you different ways where it says you different ways where it says unreported, PC and exploited. So we have unreported, PC and exploited. So we have unreported, PC and exploited. So we have seen like for most of the CVS that we seen like for most of the CVS that we seen like for most of the CVS that we publish there is no PC or it has not publish there is no PC or it has not publish there is no PC or it has not been exploited thankfully. Um and been exploited thankfully. Um and been exploited thankfully. Um and therefore there is a like 1.5 to two therefore there is a like 1.5 to two therefore there is a like 1.5 to two maybe even more difference between the B maybe even more difference between the B maybe even more difference between the B and the BT score. So I think what I'm and the BT score. So I think what I'm and the BT score. So I think what I'm trying to say I ask is like do you think trying to say I ask is like do you think trying to say I ask is like do you think if more providers provide the BT score if more providers provide the BT score if more providers provide the BT score when it's unreported and PO also and when it's unreported and PO also and when it's unreported and PO also and then you see a difference in the graph then you see a difference in the graph then you see a difference in the graph that you showed would that be more that you showed would that be more that you showed would that be more helpful? So what that impacts helpful? So what that impacts helpful? So what that impacts essentially from a priority essentially from a priority essentially from a priority perspective is th all those 9.8 scores. perspective is th all those 9.8 scores. perspective is th all those 9.8 scores. So it does put those usually at the tip So it does put those usually at the tip So it does put those usually at the tip of the spear. So it does have an impact, of the spear.
