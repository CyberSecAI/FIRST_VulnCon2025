Kind: captions Language: en Hey uh hello everyone. So I will just do Hey uh hello everyone. So I will just do Hey uh hello everyone. So I will just do a little bit of the starting talk and a little bit of the starting talk and a little bit of the starting talk and we'll cover like the first five slides we'll cover like the first five slides we'll cover like the first five slides and my my colleague will jump in and and my my colleague will jump in and and my my colleague will jump in and talk about the rest of the slides. So my talk about the rest of the slides. So my talk about the rest of the slides. So my name is here my name is Monen uh I'm an name is here my name is Monen uh I'm an name is here my name is Monen uh I'm an assistant professor at the VU Amsterdan assistant professor at the VU Amsterdan assistant professor at the VU Amsterdan and we fly all the way from the and we fly all the way from the and we fly all the way from the Netherlands to here. So today's topic is Netherlands to here. So today's topic is Netherlands to here. So today's topic is about inconsistency between V3.1 and V4 about inconsistency between V3.1 and V4 about inconsistency between V3.1 and V4 and what can we do about it. Uh I will and what can we do about it. Uh I will and what can we do about it. Uh I will just save like 30 seconds for my just save like 30 seconds for my just save like 30 seconds for my colleague to introduce herself before I colleague to introduce herself before I colleague to introduce herself before I start. Yeah, good afternoon everyone. My start. Yeah, good afternoon everyone. My start. Yeah, good afternoon everyone. My my name is Chisan from uh VU Amsterdam. my name is Chisan from uh VU Amsterdam. my name is Chisan from uh VU Amsterdam. I'm a this is my second PhD and I'm I'm a this is my second PhD and I'm I'm a this is my second PhD and I'm supervised by uh Muan and Fab Fabio supervised by uh Muan and Fab Fabio supervised by uh Muan and Fab Fabio Massage and our research work is uh Massage and our research work is uh Massage and our research work is uh funded by the Dutch research council funded by the Dutch research council funded by the Dutch research council NWO. Okay, great. So I think we're here NWO. Okay, great. So I think we're here NWO. Okay, great. So I think we're here and this is already the second day of and this is already the second day of and this is already the second day of the presentation and we heard a lot of the presentation and we heard a lot of the presentation and we heard a lot of issues in CPSS and in particular you can issues in CPSS and in particular you can issues in CPSS and in particular you can see that we kind of capture two blocks see that we kind of capture two blocks see that we kind of capture two blocks talking about this particular issue. Uh talking about this particular issue. Uh talking about this particular issue. Uh 2022 we look at only V3 and we see that 2022 we look at only V3 and we see that 2022 we look at only V3 and we see that Red Hat has uh low vulnerabilities and Red Hat has uh low vulnerabilities and Red Hat has uh low vulnerabilities and NVD is bit like inconsistent. What is NVD is bit like inconsistent. What is NVD is bit like inconsistent. What is going on with other CNAs? Then we go going on with other CNAs? Then we go going on with other CNAs? Then we go with speed bit later and we see that with speed bit later and we see that with speed bit later and we see that actually also uh we can see that actually also uh we can see that actually also uh we can see that vancheek did another research and seeing vancheek did another research and seeing vancheek did another research and seeing that uh CVSS v3 associate with uh lower that uh CVSS v3 associate with uh lower that uh CVSS v3 associate with uh lower scores or that they have like 20% of the scores or that they have like 20% of the scores or that they have like 20% of the difference with two different CNS difference with two different CNS difference with two different CNS something like this. So here we can see something like this. So here we can see something like this. So here we can see this is not something uh very real. Uh this is not something uh very real. Uh this is not something uh very real. Uh inconsistency has been talked and inconsistency has been talked and inconsistency has been talked and researched and also in academic works we researched and also in academic works we researched and also in academic works we see like people working on missing see like people working on missing see like people working on missing information inconsistencies and missing information inconsistencies and missing information inconsistencies and missing uh different versions and all kinds of uh different versions and all kinds of uh different versions and all kinds of problems. problems. problems. So uh scientifically we would like to So uh scientifically we would like to So uh scientifically we would like to see that what why what's the reason see that what why what's the reason see that what why what's the reason behind this kind of inconsistency and we behind this kind of inconsistency and we behind this kind of inconsistency and we research in other domains and see that research in other domains and see that research in other domains and see that okay it or mainly caused because human okay it or mainly caused because human okay it or mainly caused because human is involved in this rating rating uh is involved in this rating rating uh is involved in this rating rating uh process for example if there's an error process for example if there's an error process for example if there's an error created by human most likely it's going created by human most likely it's going created by human most likely it's going to happen or they're like subjective to happen or they're like subjective to happen or they're like subjective understandings uh people a think it's understandings uh people a think it's understandings uh people a think it's like this and people b disagrees and like this and people b disagrees and like this and people b disagrees and there's nothing wrong most most likely there's nothing wrong most most likely there's nothing wrong most most likely both version could work but it leads to both version could work but it leads to both version could work but it leads to some kind of discrepancies. Otherwise, some kind of discrepancies. Otherwise, some kind of discrepancies. Otherwise, we could consider insufficient we could consider insufficient we could consider insufficient information. For example, you consider information. For example, you consider information. For example, you consider only like couple words of the only like couple words of the only like couple words of the description and then people say, "Oh, description and then people say, "Oh, description and then people say, "Oh, that's not enough for the rating." And that's not enough for the rating." And that's not enough for the rating." And we assume this going to happen. Okay? we assume this going to happen. Okay? we assume this going to happen. Okay? So, if you assume that someone else So, if you assume that someone else So, if you assume that someone else could assume something else and we can could assume something else and we can could assume something else and we can see there isn't a real example we see there isn't a real example we see there isn't a real example we captured with the very same description captured with the very same description captured with the very same description and lead to three different values. And and lead to three different values. And and lead to three different values. And if we map to severity level, it gets if we map to severity level, it gets if we map to severity level, it gets even worse. Something is critical, high even worse. Something is critical, high even worse. Something is critical, high or median. Then we talk about the or median. Then we talk about the or median. Then we talk about the vulnerability management or vulnerability management or vulnerability management or prioritization is going to lead to prioritization is going to lead to prioritization is going to lead to completely different result. And this is completely different result. And this is completely different result. And this is already our work. We published somewhere already our work. We published somewhere already our work. We published somewhere here and we can see the footnote here. here and we can see the footnote here. here and we can see the footnote here. And we did a little bit of the root And we did a little bit of the root And we did a little bit of the root cause for this one. And actually because cause for this one. And actually because cause for this one. And actually because the sequence of the CVE ID is pretty the sequence of the CVE ID is pretty the sequence of the CVE ID is pretty close by. And we realized maybe during close by. And we realized maybe during close by. And we realized maybe during the process people just use the previous the process people just use the previous the process people just use the previous uh description to rate the later. Oh no uh description to rate the later. Oh no uh description to rate the later. Oh no actually people put the description actually people put the description actually people put the description corresponding to the CV ID but rated corresponding to the CV ID but rated corresponding to the CV ID but rated based on the real vulnerability. So when based on the real vulnerability. So when based on the real vulnerability. So when you see it it's actually the same but it you see it it's actually the same but it you see it it's actually the same but it should be a different vulnerability but should be a different vulnerability but should be a different vulnerability but no one knows what happened. But that's no one knows what happened. But that's no one knows what happened. But that's for consumers. So when they see it they for consumers. So when they see it they for consumers. So when they see it they only see something like this. Okay. So only see something like this. Okay. So only see something like this. Okay. So that's pretty bad. And let's say a that's pretty bad. And let's say a that's pretty bad. And let's say a concrete example here and there's a concrete example here and there's a concrete example here and there's a description from CV description from CV description from CV 2023 and then we see that okay uh if I 2023 and then we see that okay uh if I 2023 and then we see that okay uh if I wanted to say here there's a sentence of wanted to say here there's a sentence of wanted to say here there's a sentence of execute whenever a user access an execute whenever a user access an execute whenever a user access an injected page so everyone is familiar injected page so everyone is familiar injected page so everyone is familiar with user interaction right uh if I ask with user interaction right uh if I ask with user interaction right uh if I ask you do you think user interaction is you do you think user interaction is you do you think user interaction is required or not required required or not required required or not required here we have required we have not here we have required we have not here we have required we have not required right so okay that's both fine required right so okay that's both fine required right so okay that's both fine because NVD thinks 99% should be because NVD thinks 99% should be because NVD thinks 99% should be required and we have other person think required and we have other person think required and we have other person think completely differently right so this is completely differently right so this is completely differently right so this is a single sentence written exactly the a single sentence written exactly the a single sentence written exactly the same but even in the room we disagree same but even in the room we disagree same but even in the room we disagree with each other right but that's fine with each other right but that's fine with each other right but that's fine but that's the real reason behind and but that's the real reason behind and but that's the real reason behind and all those all those all those discrepancies. So let's talk about discrepancies. So let's talk about discrepancies. So let's talk about what's going on and what's new here. Uh what's going on and what's new here. Uh what's going on and what's new here. Uh by speaking what's new, I will just let by speaking what's new, I will just let by speaking what's new, I will just let the new presenter enter and she will the new presenter enter and she will the new presenter enter and she will cover the rest of the talk. cover the rest of the talk. cover the rest of the talk. Yes. Okay. So what's new here? Based on Yes. Okay. So what's new here? Based on Yes. Okay. So what's new here? Based on the timeline of CVs version updates, the timeline of CVs version updates, the timeline of CVs version updates, there have been five versions and CV SS there have been five versions and CV SS there have been five versions and CV SS 4.0 O was just released in November 4.0 O was just released in November 4.0 O was just released in November 2023 and each new version is generally 2023 and each new version is generally 2023 and each new version is generally built upon the previous one offering built upon the previous one offering built upon the previous one offering more refined and detailed guidance. So more refined and detailed guidance. So more refined and detailed guidance. So this raises a question for our this raises a question for our this raises a question for our study. How was V3.1 refined into V4? And study. How was V3.1 refined into V4? And study. How was V3.1 refined into V4? And more importantly, do the vulnerability more importantly, do the vulnerability more importantly, do the vulnerability ratings remain consistent across ratings remain consistent across ratings remain consistent across versions? So first of all we would like to know if So first of all we would like to know if So first of all we would like to know if uh advanced LLM such as chargept could uh advanced LLM such as chargept could uh advanced LLM such as chargept could generate v3.1 and v4 metrical vectors generate v3.1 and v4 metrical vectors generate v3.1 and v4 metrical vectors consistently. So in step one we designed consistently. So in step one we designed consistently. So in step one we designed a prompt that listed all metric names a prompt that listed all metric names a prompt that listed all metric names for both versions. This is necessary for both versions. This is necessary for both versions. This is necessary because in the preliminary experiment we because in the preliminary experiment we because in the preliminary experiment we simply asking please provide us metrics simply asking please provide us metrics simply asking please provide us metrics or base metrics for both versions often or base metrics for both versions often or base metrics for both versions often lead to um irrelevant metro groups such lead to um irrelevant metro groups such lead to um irrelevant metro groups such as environmental metrics or omitted v4 as environmental metrics or omitted v4 as environmental metrics or omitted v4 specific specific specific metrics. So by listing metric names in metrics. So by listing metric names in metrics. So by listing metric names in the prompt finally we can get uh uh CVS the prompt finally we can get uh uh CVS the prompt finally we can get uh uh CVS metric vectors in a correct format. metric vectors in a correct format. metric vectors in a correct format. And in step two, we collected the uh CV And in step two, we collected the uh CV And in step two, we collected the uh CV entries containing both versions that entries containing both versions that entries containing both versions that were provided by two companies involved were provided by two companies involved were provided by two companies involved in the CV SSC and one from public source in the CV SSC and one from public source in the CV SSC and one from public source CV.org. So you can see here we listed CV.org. So you can see here we listed CV.org. So you can see here we listed all combinations of each metric across all combinations of each metric across all combinations of each metric across versions. Um I will explain it later how versions. Um I will explain it later how versions. Um I will explain it later how and why we combine the metrics like this and why we combine the metrics like this and why we combine the metrics like this way. So the re by comparing the way. So the re by comparing the way. So the re by comparing the predicted value against our uh ground predicted value against our uh ground predicted value against our uh ground truth, the result shows that the uh truth, the result shows that the uh truth, the result shows that the uh attack vector and the uh prearage attack vector and the uh prearage attack vector and the uh prearage required and impact metrics perform required and impact metrics perform required and impact metrics perform relatively low weighted F1 score. So relatively low weighted F1 score. So relatively low weighted F1 score. So this may be because inconsistencies this may be because inconsistencies this may be because inconsistencies exist in a combined metric value across exist in a combined metric value across exist in a combined metric value across versions. versions. versions. uh let's look at an example of how may uh let's look at an example of how may uh let's look at an example of how may this inconsistency produced by judge PT. this inconsistency produced by judge PT. this inconsistency produced by judge PT. So this is an example we already So this is an example we already So this is an example we already discussed in previous slides as NVD and discussed in previous slides as NVD and discussed in previous slides as NVD and uh uh CNA do not agree with each other. uh uh CNA do not agree with each other. uh uh CNA do not agree with each other. So we are curious about how CH GPT would So we are curious about how CH GPT would So we are curious about how CH GPT would rate this value. The result shows that rate this value. The result shows that rate this value. The result shows that both agree uh uh both version rated the both agree uh uh both version rated the both agree uh uh both version rated the user interaction as uh required. required. required. So however we noticed So however we noticed So however we noticed here the scope in v3 the scope has here the scope in v3 the scope has here the scope in v3 the scope has considered as changed but in v4 which considered as changed but in v4 which considered as changed but in v4 which means which which means the uh impact means which which means the uh impact means which which means the uh impact extends beyond the vulnerable extends beyond the vulnerable extends beyond the vulnerable components. So there should be have some components. So there should be have some components. So there should be have some uh subsequent uh impact but charge has uh subsequent uh impact but charge has uh subsequent uh impact but charge has considered a V4 uh as no any impact considered a V4 uh as no any impact considered a V4 uh as no any impact matrix value uh so here what can we do so far CV uh uh so here what can we do so far CV uh uh so here what can we do so far CV uh CV SSV3.1 is still the premier uh CV SSV3.1 is still the premier uh CV SSV3.1 is still the premier uh scoring versions used by most scoring versions used by most scoring versions used by most organizations while V4 remains in its organizations while V4 remains in its organizations while V4 remains in its early adoption phase. early adoption phase. early adoption phase. Some vendors such as Bond DB has uh Some vendors such as Bond DB has uh Some vendors such as Bond DB has uh started providing CVs version 4 ratings started providing CVs version 4 ratings started providing CVs version 4 ratings usually alongside usually alongside usually alongside V3.1 and in most cases one version comes V3.1 and in most cases one version comes V3.1 and in most cases one version comes up first and then followed by another up first and then followed by another up first and then followed by another version maybe rated after uh version maybe rated after uh version maybe rated after uh sometime uh which may lead sometime uh which may lead sometime uh which may lead inconsistencies between two versions. So inconsistencies between two versions. So inconsistencies between two versions. So for example this is a CV entry uh rated for example this is a CV entry uh rated for example this is a CV entry uh rated by one DB. So you can see they have by one DB. So you can see they have by one DB. So you can see they have rated version 3.1 as uh user interaction rated version 3.1 as uh user interaction rated version 3.1 as uh user interaction required but way four is no user uh no required but way four is no user uh no required but way four is no user uh no user interaction required which is inconsistent so inconsistent so inconsistent so um so to avoid this kind of issue we um so to avoid this kind of issue we um so to avoid this kind of issue we proposing using consistency rules and proposing using consistency rules and proposing using consistency rules and rating both versions at the same time. rating both versions at the same time. rating both versions at the same time. For example, if you first read V3.1 and For example, if you first read V3.1 and For example, if you first read V3.1 and consider it is uh required, then you consider it is uh required, then you consider it is uh required, then you should consider V4 is passive or uh should consider V4 is passive or uh should consider V4 is passive or uh active. If you read V4 first, for active. If you read V4 first, for active. If you read V4 first, for example, you consider is not user example, you consider is not user example, you consider is not user interaction required, then you should interaction required, then you should interaction required, then you should also read V3.1 as not required. So in also read V3.1 as not required. So in also read V3.1 as not required. So in this way, you will save time and avoid this way, you will save time and avoid this way, you will save time and avoid inconsistency later on. And if there is inconsistency later on. And if there is inconsistency later on. And if there is an a version already available, you can an a version already available, you can an a version already available, you can also read another version. But uh well also read another version. But uh well also read another version. But uh well but if you can using our roots, you can but if you can using our roots, you can but if you can using our roots, you can uh help you you can quickly spot any uh help you you can quickly spot any uh help you you can quickly spot any inconsistencies and you can correct it inconsistencies and you can correct it inconsistencies and you can correct it if necessary. Okay. So let's start to necessary. Okay. So let's start to necessary. Okay. So let's start to introduce our knowledge based consistent introduce our knowledge based consistent introduce our knowledge based consistent rules. Um by reviewing the first rules. Um by reviewing the first rules. Um by reviewing the first official documentation we defined three official documentation we defined three official documentation we defined three types of mapping relationship between types of mapping relationship between types of mapping relationship between V3.1 and V4 V3.1 and V4 V3.1 and V4 metrics. Uh the first one is one to one metrics. Uh the first one is one to one metrics. Uh the first one is one to one mapping. It's quite straightforward. So mapping. It's quite straightforward. So mapping. It's quite straightforward. So if the definition of a metric and the if the definition of a metric and the if the definition of a metric and the metric value do not change between metric value do not change between metric value do not change between versions. So the evaluation should versions. So the evaluation should versions. So the evaluation should remain the same across versions. So here remain the same across versions. So here remain the same across versions. So here we have AV and PR fall into this category as them do not have changed uh category as them do not have changed uh category as them do not have changed uh during the version updates. And the second mapping is uh uh updates. And the second mapping is uh uh updates. And the second mapping is uh uh one to many. So here we have uh user one to many. So here we have uh user one to many. So here we have uh user interaction and attack complexity fall interaction and attack complexity fall interaction and attack complexity fall into this category. For example, when you read a For example, when you read a For example, when you read a vulnerability at the same time for both vulnerability at the same time for both vulnerability at the same time for both versions, you consider there is no user versions, you consider there is no user versions, you consider there is no user interaction record. So you just simply interaction record. So you just simply interaction record. So you just simply uh give the value not required for both uh give the value not required for both uh give the value not required for both versions. And if you think it's record, versions. And if you think it's record, versions. And if you think it's record, you assign record in V3.1 and you should you assign record in V3.1 and you should you assign record in V3.1 and you should sign possible active in V4. And for sign possible active in V4. And for sign possible active in V4. And for attack complexity. So first we look at the low complexity. So first we look at the low complexity. So first we look at the low complexity in v3.1. So it can be complexity in v3.1. So it can be complexity in v3.1. So it can be directly mapped to uh low in way 4 with directly mapped to uh low in way 4 with directly mapped to uh low in way 4 with attack uh with attack requirements attack uh with attack requirements attack uh with attack requirements needed or not needed. It depends on needed or not needed. It depends on needed or not needed. It depends on whether pre- request conditions are whether pre- request conditions are whether pre- request conditions are invoked. And similar for high attack invoked. And similar for high attack invoked. And similar for high attack complexity you can directly map to high complexity you can directly map to high complexity you can directly map to high with again with or without attack with again with or without attack with again with or without attack requirements. And there is a special requirements. And there is a special requirements. And there is a special case for high complexity in V3. And case for high complexity in V3. And case for high complexity in V3. And maybe this also is the reason why they maybe this also is the reason why they maybe this also is the reason why they have changed the attack complexity from have changed the attack complexity from have changed the attack complexity from V3 to V4 like split AC to AC and 18 V4. V3 to V4 like split AC to AC and 18 V4. V3 to V4 like split AC to AC and 18 V4. So this is because the high value in uh So this is because the high value in uh So this is because the high value in uh uh the high value of AC in uh the high value of AC in uh the high value of AC in V3.1 do not reflect the significant V3.1 do not reflect the significant V3.1 do not reflect the significant difference between conditions currently difference between conditions currently difference between conditions currently compressed in the definition of high compressed in the definition of high compressed in the definition of high complexity. So V4 M2 address this issue complexity. So V4 M2 address this issue complexity. So V4 M2 address this issue by splitting ACA into AC and A in by splitting ACA into AC and A in by splitting ACA into AC and A in before. before. before. For example, the rest condition the For example, the rest condition the For example, the rest condition the attack itself is not technically complex attack itself is not technically complex attack itself is not technically complex but it relies on like specific external but it relies on like specific external but it relies on like specific external conditions. So in this uh vulnerability conditions. So in this uh vulnerability conditions. So in this uh vulnerability the AC has been assigned high in v3.1 the AC has been assigned high in v3.1 the AC has been assigned high in v3.1 then it downgraded to low in v4 with uh then it downgraded to low in v4 with uh then it downgraded to low in v4 with uh present of attack requirements. So here present of attack requirements. So here present of attack requirements. So here we have a high mapped to low and present we have a high mapped to low and present we have a high mapped to low and present of 80. So in total we have five of 80. So in total we have five of 80. So in total we have five consistent combinations for attack complexity. The third one is many to complexity. The third one is many to complexity. The third one is many to many. So here uh as the scope property many. So here uh as the scope property many. So here uh as the scope property in v3.1 has been removed in v4. So its in v3.1 has been removed in v4. So its in v3.1 has been removed in v4. So its concept has separating into the concept has separating into the concept has separating into the vulnerable system impact and the vulnerable system impact and the vulnerable system impact and the subsequent system impact. Um so here we consider impact value Um so here we consider impact value Um so here we consider impact value assigned into these two systems depend assigned into these two systems depend assigned into these two systems depend on the value assigned to scope metric in on the value assigned to scope metric in on the value assigned to scope metric in v3.1. Here I will first uh talk about v3.1. Here I will first uh talk about v3.1. Here I will first uh talk about the scope is unchanged. It's uh uh quite the scope is unchanged. It's uh uh quite the scope is unchanged. It's uh uh quite simple because there should be the simple because there should be the simple because there should be the impact uh effect with no con constraint impact uh effect with no con constraint impact uh effect with no con constraint consequences. So like all metrics should consequences. So like all metrics should consequences. So like all metrics should be uh fully applied to vulnerable system be uh fully applied to vulnerable system be uh fully applied to vulnerable system with uh no impact on the subsequent with uh no impact on the subsequent with uh no impact on the subsequent system. For example, you have high low system. For example, you have high low system. For example, you have high low low assigned to low assigned to low assigned to V3.1 then you also should have high low V3.1 then you also should have high low V3.1 then you also should have high low assigned to vulnerable system with no assigned to vulnerable system with no assigned to vulnerable system with no impact in the subsequent system. You can impact in the subsequent system. You can impact in the subsequent system. You can also say the expression below like also say the expression below like also say the expression below like unchanged with unchanged scope unchanged with unchanged scope unchanged with unchanged scope vulnerable system equal to CIA with no vulnerable system equal to CIA with no vulnerable system equal to CIA with no impact on the subsequent system. So yeah the scope is changed is more So yeah the scope is changed is more So yeah the scope is changed is more complicated. So after our study in the complicated. So after our study in the complicated. So after our study in the data sets we have we defined the four data sets we have we defined the four data sets we have we defined the four cases. I will introduce one by one with cases. I will introduce one by one with cases. I will introduce one by one with an example and its uh expression will an example and its uh expression will an example and its uh expression will list below. list below. list below. The first one uh when the scope is The first one uh when the scope is The first one uh when the scope is changed the CIA could uh be um fully changed the CIA could uh be um fully changed the CIA could uh be um fully transferred to both systems. So here if transferred to both systems. So here if transferred to both systems. So here if you have high high low then you will you have high high low then you will you have high high low then you will also have high high low in vulnerable also have high high low in vulnerable also have high high low in vulnerable and subsequent and subsequent and subsequent system. The second one the uh vulnerable system. The second one the uh vulnerable system. The second one the uh vulnerable system could be fully impacted and the system could be fully impacted and the system could be fully impacted and the subsequent system experience some level subsequent system experience some level subsequent system experience some level of impact. So here if you have a high of impact. So here if you have a high of impact. So here if you have a high high non here you will also have high high non here you will also have high high non here you will also have high high in vulnerable system and different high in vulnerable system and different high in vulnerable system and different value assigned to subsequent system but value assigned to subsequent system but value assigned to subsequent system but I cannot equal to the vulnerable or the I cannot equal to the vulnerable or the I cannot equal to the vulnerable or the CIA otherwise it it's the same as the CIA otherwise it it's the same as the CIA otherwise it it's the same as the first rule and the third one is the subsequent rule and the third one is the subsequent rule and the third one is the subsequent system should be fully impacted well the system should be fully impacted well the system should be fully impacted well the vulnerable system may only experience vulnerable system may only experience vulnerable system may only experience partial or no impact. So here if you partial or no impact. So here if you partial or no impact. So here if you have high high non here it could be have high high non here it could be have high high non here it could be fully transferred to subsequent system fully transferred to subsequent system fully transferred to subsequent system and no impact on the vulnerable system and no impact on the vulnerable system and no impact on the vulnerable system or maybe some level of uh impact on the or maybe some level of uh impact on the or maybe some level of uh impact on the vulnerable system. And last one uh CI impact system. And last one uh CI impact system. And last one uh CI impact distribute the impact between vulnerable distribute the impact between vulnerable distribute the impact between vulnerable system and subsequent system which each system and subsequent system which each system and subsequent system which each impact value transferred to one system impact value transferred to one system impact value transferred to one system with another one has no impact. So if uh with another one has no impact. So if uh with another one has no impact. So if uh you have like low confidentiality and you have like low confidentiality and you have like low confidentiality and high integrate it has been transferred high integrate it has been transferred high integrate it has been transferred to uh it considered as subsequent system to uh it considered as subsequent system to uh it considered as subsequent system then you have no impact on the then you have no impact on the then you have no impact on the vulnerable system and also if you have a vulnerable system and also if you have a vulnerable system and also if you have a low availability here has been low availability here has been low availability here has been considered as vulnerable system so there considered as vulnerable system so there considered as vulnerable system so there will be no value in the subsequent system. So let's see how our rule could system. So let's see how our rule could system. So let's see how our rule could help the real world data set by help the real world data set by help the real world data set by um so we we have two public data set um so we we have two public data set um so we we have two public data set that collected one from cv.org from last that collected one from cv.org from last that collected one from cv.org from last year and one is from v this year and all year and one is from v this year and all year and one is from v this year and all rated by uh von db. Overall we have over rated by uh von db. Overall we have over rated by uh von db. Overall we have over 2,000 cvees. 2,000 cvees. 2,000 cvees. So by applying our rules the results um So by applying our rules the results um So by applying our rules the results um the the the result is quite good at as the the the result is quite good at as the the the result is quite good at as almost all metric remain consistent almost all metric remain consistent almost all metric remain consistent across versions except the UI. So the UI across versions except the UI. So the UI across versions except the UI. So the UI shows relatively high inconsistency shows relatively high inconsistency shows relatively high inconsistency 22.1% of CV entries that were rated as 22.1% of CV entries that were rated as 22.1% of CV entries that were rated as the required in V3.1 but as non in V4. the required in V3.1 but as non in V4. the required in V3.1 but as non in V4. So this means errors um may produce in So this means errors um may produce in So this means errors um may produce in one of these two versions. So analyst one of these two versions. So analyst one of these two versions. So analyst could simply discuss and modify one of could simply discuss and modify one of could simply discuss and modify one of them to keep consistency across versions. Uh we also examined the versions. Uh we also examined the versions. Uh we also examined the private data set obtained from the CV private data set obtained from the CV private data set obtained from the CV SSI which was collected last year and SSI which was collected last year and SSI which was collected last year and contains over 6,000 CVES. The result contains over 6,000 CVES. The result contains over 6,000 CVES. The result shows that even for straightforward shows that even for straightforward shows that even for straightforward mapping metrics like uh AV and PR there mapping metrics like uh AV and PR there mapping metrics like uh AV and PR there still have some still have some still have some inconsistencies and for UI three inconsistencies and for UI three inconsistencies and for UI three inconsistent combinations together inconsistent combinations together inconsistent combinations together accounts for 3.1 of the uh entries uh accounts for 3.1 of the uh entries uh accounts for 3.1 of the uh entries uh which is relatively high. So we have which is relatively high. So we have which is relatively high. So we have reported by two company uh B ask why reported by two company uh B ask why reported by two company uh B ask why this happened. So they are very interest this happened. So they are very interest this happened. So they are very interest very interesting in reviewing the effect very interesting in reviewing the effect very interesting in reviewing the effect the CVS and may apply the correction if necessary and same as the impact you can necessary and same as the impact you can necessary and same as the impact you can see the company A also have very high see the company A also have very high see the company A also have very high inconsistent metrics rel related to inconsistent metrics rel related to inconsistent metrics rel related to impact 26.7%. impact 26.7%. impact 26.7%. So we also reported back to company A So we also reported back to company A So we also reported back to company A then shared the internal agreement. So then shared the internal agreement. So then shared the internal agreement. So but uh um however despite but uh um however despite but uh um however despite however even if we applying this hiden however even if we applying this hiden however even if we applying this hiden agreement rules there still have 3.3% of agreement rules there still have 3.3% of agreement rules there still have 3.3% of entries uh exact inconsistencies related entries uh exact inconsistencies related entries uh exact inconsistencies related to impact. Yeah. impact. Yeah. impact. Yeah. Conclusion. So CV SSV4 is still in its Conclusion. So CV SSV4 is still in its Conclusion. So CV SSV4 is still in its early adoption phase. So due to limited early adoption phase. So due to limited early adoption phase. So due to limited data available, our NLS is based on what data available, our NLS is based on what data available, our NLS is based on what uh uh we collected. So we're also uh uh we collected. So we're also uh uh we collected. So we're also looking for more data to support our looking for more data to support our looking for more data to support our study and help improve our roots. We study and help improve our roots. We study and help improve our roots. We would uh yeah great appreciate if you would uh yeah great appreciate if you would uh yeah great appreciate if you have any CV SV4 data that could be have any CV SV4 data that could be have any CV SV4 data that could be shared with us and also even if some shared with us and also even if some shared with us and also even if some companies apply hiden agreement rules companies apply hiden agreement rules companies apply hiden agreement rules integrating them with our consistency integrating them with our consistency integrating them with our consistency rules can still help detect inconsistent rules can still help detect inconsistent rules can still help detect inconsistent um entries. And last we have a open um entries. And last we have a open um entries. And last we have a open question. After applying our rules um to question. After applying our rules um to question. After applying our rules um to ensure the consistent ratings across ensure the consistent ratings across ensure the consistent ratings across versions, we still observe some uh versions, we still observe some uh versions, we still observe some uh severity level shifts between two severity level shifts between two severity level shifts between two versions. So this raises the following versions. So this raises the following versions. So this raises the following question. So which uh for some users use question. So which uh for some users use question. So which uh for some users use both v3.1 and v4. So which version both v3.1 and v4. So which version both v3.1 and v4. So which version should then trust it for patching or should then trust it for patching or should then trust it for patching or preoritization when both are available? preoritization when both are available? preoritization when both are available? And the second does the formula used to And the second does the formula used to And the second does the formula used to calculate V4 severity level still have calculate V4 severity level still have calculate V4 severity level still have room to improvement for example if you room to improvement for example if you room to improvement for example if you can make two versions in the same can make two versions in the same can make two versions in the same ballpark or reduce some level ballpark or reduce some level ballpark or reduce some level shifts. Yeah, that's the end of my shifts. Yeah, that's the end of my shifts. Yeah, that's the end of my presentation. So I I understand the new there are new So I I understand the new there are new So I I understand the new there are new vectors involved in 4.0 compared to 3.1. vectors involved in 4.0 compared to 3.1. vectors involved in 4.0 compared to 3.1. Yes. Did any of your analysis and your Yes. Did any of your analysis and your Yes. Did any of your analysis and your research show why you were getting research show why you were getting research show why you were getting different results on the same vector? different results on the same vector? different results on the same vector? Uh, I know in the beginning you had Uh, I know in the beginning you had Uh, I know in the beginning you had somewhere somewhere it was no versus R somewhere somewhere it was no versus R somewhere somewhere it was no versus R like it was different 3.1 versus 4.0 for like it was different 3.1 versus 4.0 for like it was different 3.1 versus 4.0 for the same factor on the same CVE because the same factor on the same CVE because the same factor on the same CVE because that's probably one of the concerning that's probably one of the concerning that's probably one of the concerning things because we don't always know why things because we don't always know why things because we don't always know why they why they were ranked that way for they why they were ranked that way for they why they were ranked that way for the same the same the same vector. Um, vector. Um, vector. Um, this one or this one or this one or No, go forward. I think it was forward No, go forward. I think it was forward No, go forward. I think it was forward two. No, forward next. Next. Uh, next. two. No, forward next. Next. Uh, next. two. No, forward next. Next. Uh, next. Yeah. Yep. Keep going. Yeah. Yep. Keep going. Yeah. Yep. Keep going. Uh, that one. So, in that case, we have Uh, that one. So, in that case, we have Uh, that one. So, in that case, we have is that was that the same one? Because is that was that the same one? Because is that was that the same one? Because if you're getting different results from if you're getting different results from if you're getting different results from the same factor in 3.1 versus 4.0 or or the same factor in 3.1 versus 4.0 or or the same factor in 3.1 versus 4.0 or or did I misunderstand that? Because we did I misunderstand that? Because we did I misunderstand that? Because we should be consistent regardless of which should be consistent regardless of which should be consistent regardless of which version of CBSS we're using, right? Yes. version of CBSS we're using, right? Yes. version of CBSS we're using, right? Yes. Again, that's why I'm asking. So, so I I Again, that's why I'm asking. So, so I I Again, that's why I'm asking. So, so I I do understand that in 4.0 you'll have do understand that in 4.0 you'll have do understand that in 4.0 you'll have three more factors that might be a three more factors that might be a three more factors that might be a little weird and adds up to go up, but little weird and adds up to go up, but little weird and adds up to go up, but it should be relatively consistent for it should be relatively consistent for it should be relatively consistent for the similar factors that apply in 3.1 the similar factors that apply in 3.1 the similar factors that apply in 3.1 and 4.0. Correct. Well, well, I mean this is the wish, Well, well, I mean this is the wish, Well, well, I mean this is the wish, right? uh we we do say that even for right? uh we we do say that even for right? uh we we do say that even for those very straightforward ones uh for those very straightforward ones uh for those very straightforward ones uh for example the concept does not even change example the concept does not even change example the concept does not even change even for the private company still have even for the private company still have even for the private company still have like 0.6 six of the discrepancy between like 0.6 six of the discrepancy between like 0.6 six of the discrepancy between two versions. Uh we we we just did the two versions. Uh we we we just did the two versions. Uh we we we just did the data analysis. We don't really know why data analysis. We don't really know why data analysis. We don't really know why it happened like this but we guess like it happened like this but we guess like it happened like this but we guess like most likely this happened in a very most likely this happened in a very most likely this happened in a very different time frame. People A rated different time frame. People A rated different time frame. People A rated like six months ago and then people B like six months ago and then people B like six months ago and then people B came in and rate the same thing like you came in and rate the same thing like you came in and rate the same thing like you know six months after. So then even I know six months after. So then even I know six months after. So then even I mean we wish this is why we say that mean we wish this is why we say that mean we wish this is why we say that okay use this rule. If you you rate it okay use this rule. If you you rate it okay use this rule. If you you rate it as uh network six months ago, please as uh network six months ago, please as uh network six months ago, please also rate next work network at least six also rate next work network at least six also rate next work network at least six months after. And if you want to change months after. And if you want to change months after. And if you want to change it, change both. So this is why we we it, change both. So this is why we we it, change both. So this is why we we put this rule in place. Okay. Thank you. So there are many new CVs for So there are many new CVs for So there are many new CVs for 2025 with 4.0 scores. So we like to see 2025 with 4.0 scores. So we like to see 2025 with 4.0 scores. So we like to see the analysis on those CVEs. I think you the analysis on those CVEs. I think you the analysis on those CVEs. I think you did some good analysis but those are did some good analysis but those are did some good analysis but those are pretty old CVS like in the first half of pretty old CVS like in the first half of pretty old CVS like in the first half of 2024. 2024. 2024. So we want to see more data, more CVS So we want to see more data, more CVS So we want to see more data, more CVS analysis. analysis. analysis. Great. Great. Well, if you can connect Great. Great. Well, if you can connect Great. Great. Well, if you can connect us with more data, we will be very happy us with more data, we will be very happy us with more data, we will be very happy to to do more analysis. Uh she actually to to do more analysis. Uh she actually to to do more analysis. Uh she actually did more work also recently, but she did more work also recently, but she did more work also recently, but she didn't put all the result here because didn't put all the result here because didn't put all the result here because for the completeness of the for the completeness of the for the completeness of the presentation, but it is an ongoing work presentation, but it is an ongoing work presentation, but it is an ongoing work and we will be very happy to receive and we will be very happy to receive and we will be very happy to receive more data. So have you looked at the more data. So have you looked at the more data. So have you looked at the GitHub data there as well? I think she GitHub data there as well? I think she GitHub data there as well? I think she did GitHub data. She did V check lately did GitHub data. She did V check lately did GitHub data. She did V check lately and I I think that was like uh 2,000 at and I I think that was like uh 2,000 at and I I think that was like uh 2,000 at beginning for the public data set. I beginning for the public data set. I beginning for the public data set. I think now she has 9,000 or something if think now she has 9,000 or something if think now she has 9,000 or something if I remember correctly. There's about Oh, I remember correctly. There's about Oh, I remember correctly. There's about Oh, there's almost 10,000 in GitHub. Okay. there's almost 10,000 in GitHub. Okay. there's almost 10,000 in GitHub. Okay. So, so what? Yes. Yeah. Well, great news So, so what? Yes. Yeah. Well, great news So, so what? Yes. Yeah. Well, great news then. Yeah, great news. then. Yeah, great news. then. Yeah, great news. So let's talk a after because I would So let's talk a after because I would So let's talk a after because I would love to compare what what I've done and love to compare what what I've done and love to compare what what I've done and what you've done because this is super what you've done because this is super what you've done because this is super interesting and you've gone very deep on interesting and you've gone very deep on interesting and you've gone very deep on how those individual metrics affect the how those individual metrics affect the how those individual metrics affect the overall score and the uncertainty. So overall score and the uncertainty. So overall score and the uncertainty. So this is really interesting and I love this is really interesting and I love this is really interesting and I love the a just the the a just the the a just the actionable knowing how it affects it and actionable knowing how it affects it and actionable knowing how it affects it and the uncertainty how you can develop a the uncertainty how you can develop a the uncertainty how you can develop a system to compensate for it. So that's system to compensate for it. So that's system to compensate for it. So that's yeah, but the look at GitHub advisories. yeah, but the look at GitHub advisories. yeah, but the look at GitHub advisories. There's a wealth of data. They're the There's a wealth of data. They're the There's a wealth of data. They're the largest data source that I've looked at largest data source that I've looked at largest data source that I've looked at both their reviewed and both their reviewed and both their reviewed and unreed and 31 and 4.0 scores. Yeah. unreed and 31 and 4.0 scores. Yeah. unreed and 31 and 4.0 scores. Yeah. Thank you. comment just from the GitHub Intel uh it comment just from the GitHub Intel uh it comment just from the GitHub Intel uh it may be as part of the CVE data that may be as part of the CVE data that may be as part of the CVE data that you're looking at but Intel Seammens you you're looking at but Intel Seammens you you're looking at but Intel Seammens you know are all producing both both 33 31 know are all producing both both 33 31 know are all producing both both 33 31 and Ford auto so those are other and Ford auto so those are other and Ford auto so those are other potential sources and there is a comment potential sources and there is a comment potential sources and there is a comment about that hey then uh you can connect us through hey then uh you can connect us through hey then uh you can connect us through my website or you and scan her that's my website or you and scan her that's my website or you and scan her that's her LinkedIn and then we can just get her LinkedIn and then we can just get her LinkedIn and then we can just get and otherwise send me send us email I I and otherwise send me send us email I I and otherwise send me send us email I I always check always check always check on yeah thank you so
