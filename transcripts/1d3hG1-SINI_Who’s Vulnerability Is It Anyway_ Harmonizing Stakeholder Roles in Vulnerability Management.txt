Kind: captions Language: en Hi everyone, thanks for coming. Hi everyone, thanks for coming. Hi everyone, thanks for coming. Um, so actually the this entire panel Um, so actually the this entire panel Um, so actually the this entire panel kind of came to life during the voncon kind of came to life during the voncon kind of came to life during the voncon of 2024 of 2024 of 2024 um kind of in conversations that um me um kind of in conversations that um me um kind of in conversations that um me and Kayla had throughout the the and Kayla had throughout the the and Kayla had throughout the the conference. Kayla, do you want to kind conference. Kayla, do you want to kind conference. Kayla, do you want to kind of share a bit about the backstory? of share a bit about the backstory? of share a bit about the backstory? Yeah, absolutely. So um as it like all Yeah, absolutely. So um as it like all Yeah, absolutely. So um as it like all the topics we discuss here are you know the topics we discuss here are you know the topics we discuss here are you know very near and dear to my heart and I very near and dear to my heart and I very near and dear to my heart and I know everyone's here because this is a know everyone's here because this is a know everyone's here because this is a fantastic uh practitioners conference. fantastic uh practitioners conference. fantastic uh practitioners conference. Um so one of the things we were talking Um so one of the things we were talking Um so one of the things we were talking about was like in my background I don't about was like in my background I don't about was like in my background I don't I am not a developer. I I do not program I am not a developer. I I do not program I am not a developer. I I do not program things. I understand it. I understand things. I understand it. I understand things. I understand it. I understand the whole conversation. I understand the whole conversation. I understand the whole conversation. I understand it's a language. I know a little bit it's a language. I know a little bit it's a language. I know a little bit about it. Right? But we were discussing about it. Right? But we were discussing about it. Right? But we were discussing the fact of the fact of the fact of as as the role that we have in as as the role that we have in as as the role that we have in vulnerability management, if you do if vulnerability management, if you do if vulnerability management, if you do if you do know all that, you're that much you do know all that, you're that much you do know all that, you're that much more valuable. But not every persona more valuable. But not every persona more valuable. But not every persona knows every bit of the story. And so knows every bit of the story. And so knows every bit of the story. And so just talking about who all's involved just talking about who all's involved just talking about who all's involved and a security researcher and a and a security researcher and a and a security researcher and a developer and um the vulnerability developer and um the vulnerability developer and um the vulnerability management management management practitioner, we had this conversation, practitioner, we had this conversation, practitioner, we had this conversation, you know, like that would be a good you know, like that would be a good you know, like that would be a good panel actually. Let's get all those panel actually. Let's get all those panel actually. Let's get all those personas together, all the voices personas together, all the voices personas together, all the voices together, and and talk about how together, and and talk about how together, and and talk about how everything segments and and how we can everything segments and and how we can everything segments and and how we can set each other up for success, but also set each other up for success, but also set each other up for success, but also talk about some of the friction points. talk about some of the friction points. talk about some of the friction points. So, here we are basically. Um, so we're So, here we are basically. Um, so we're So, here we are basically. Um, so we're going to kind of dive into the going to kind of dive into the going to kind of dive into the complexities and the challenges in the complexities and the challenges in the complexities and the challenges in the entire vulnerability management process entire vulnerability management process entire vulnerability management process and specifically about the the tension, and specifically about the the tension, and specifically about the the tension, the complexities uh and the different the complexities uh and the different the complexities uh and the different perspectives that each stakeholder comes perspectives that each stakeholder comes perspectives that each stakeholder comes into this process with. Um, so maybe into this process with. Um, so maybe into this process with. Um, so maybe before we start, let's do a kind of before we start, let's do a kind of before we start, let's do a kind of quick round of introduction. Um, so I'm quick round of introduction. Um, so I'm quick round of introduction. Um, so I'm Yam. I currently lead the threat Yam. I currently lead the threat Yam. I currently lead the threat research at uh threat research team at research at uh threat research team at research at uh threat research team at Zcaler. Uh prior to that I worked uh at Zcaler. Uh prior to that I worked uh at Zcaler. Uh prior to that I worked uh at a startup called Resilient for five a startup called Resilient for five a startup called Resilient for five years led the research there. Um and years led the research there. Um and years led the research there. Um and also with a short stint of of leading also with a short stint of of leading also with a short stint of of leading the cloud engineering team. So kind of the cloud engineering team. So kind of the cloud engineering team. So kind of more DevOps more DevOps more DevOps um oriented work. Uh and prior to that I um oriented work. Uh and prior to that I um oriented work. Uh and prior to that I did a couple of roles uh in the PayPal did a couple of roles uh in the PayPal did a couple of roles uh in the PayPal security organization doing dealing with security organization doing dealing with security organization doing dealing with uh insider threats, threat intelligence uh insider threats, threat intelligence uh insider threats, threat intelligence uh kind of doing data science uh machine uh kind of doing data science uh machine uh kind of doing data science uh machine learning work on detections there. Um, learning work on detections there. Um, learning work on detections there. Um, and yeah, let's start. Uh, Kayla. Yeah. and yeah, let's start. Uh, Kayla. Yeah. and yeah, let's start. Uh, Kayla. Yeah. So, I'm Kayla Under Coffler, a lead So, I'm Kayla Under Coffler, a lead So, I'm Kayla Under Coffler, a lead security engineer with Zenedity. Um, and security engineer with Zenedity. Um, and security engineer with Zenedity. Um, and the majority of the persona that I'm the majority of the persona that I'm the majority of the persona that I'm going to be representing today is the going to be representing today is the going to be representing today is the vulnerability management operator. Um, vulnerability management operator. Um, vulnerability management operator. Um, which is my uh my background. It's where which is my uh my background. It's where which is my uh my background. It's where I got my my real start in security. So, I got my my real start in security. So, I got my my real start in security. So, think, you know, security engineer, think, you know, security engineer, think, you know, security engineer, security analyst. You're running the security analyst. You're running the security analyst. You're running the scanner. you're responsible for making scanner. you're responsible for making scanner. you're responsible for making sure all those vulnerabilities get to sure all those vulnerabilities get to sure all those vulnerabilities get to the right stakeholders um in the right the right stakeholders um in the right the right stakeholders um in the right way. Um and you know you're not maybe way. Um and you know you're not maybe way. Um and you know you're not maybe you're not necessarily worried about the you're not necessarily worried about the you're not necessarily worried about the remediation of those vulnerabilities. remediation of those vulnerabilities. remediation of those vulnerabilities. Well, you are but not hands-on. Um but Well, you are but not hands-on. Um but Well, you are but not hands-on. Um but that yeah that's my that's my that yeah that's my that's my that yeah that's my that's my background. That's where I had my years background. That's where I had my years background. That's where I had my years of experience. Um so that's the persona of experience. Um so that's the persona of experience. Um so that's the persona I'll represent today. I'll represent today. I'll represent today. Hi everyone, my name is Hava. Um I'm an Hi everyone, my name is Hava. Um I'm an Hi everyone, my name is Hava. Um I'm an security analyst at Sneak for like three security analyst at Sneak for like three security analyst at Sneak for like three and a half year now. Um I'm basically and a half year now. Um I'm basically and a half year now. Um I'm basically triaging tracking and filtering vulnerab triaging tracking and filtering vulnerab triaging tracking and filtering vulnerab potential vulnerabilities every day. Uh potential vulnerabilities every day. Uh potential vulnerabilities every day. Uh making sure that the real ones are going making sure that the real ones are going making sure that the real ones are going into Snick's database uh in the most into Snick's database uh in the most into Snick's database uh in the most accurate complete and actionable way. uh accurate complete and actionable way. uh accurate complete and actionable way. uh and we're working also on different and we're working also on different and we're working also on different projects like the rescore feature uh projects like the rescore feature uh projects like the rescore feature uh that sneak has and I was working on that that sneak has and I was working on that that sneak has and I was working on that and uh it takes into account a lot of uh and uh it takes into account a lot of uh and uh it takes into account a lot of uh different parameters and like a lot of different parameters and like a lot of different parameters and like a lot of data analysis around the that subject of data analysis around the that subject of data analysis around the that subject of vulnerabilities uh mainly in open source vulnerabilities uh mainly in open source vulnerabilities uh mainly in open source and container um and today I'll be and container um and today I'll be and container um and today I'll be representing of course the perspective representing of course the perspective representing of course the perspective of the analyst but also the perspective of the analyst but also the perspective of the analyst but also the perspective of the developers that always need uh to of the developers that always need uh to of the developers that always need uh to move fast to keep up with deadlines Um move fast to keep up with deadlines Um move fast to keep up with deadlines Um and that a lot of time feels like uh the and that a lot of time feels like uh the and that a lot of time feels like uh the like fixing vulnerabilities those issue like fixing vulnerabilities those issue like fixing vulnerabilities those issue that they're getting in their backlog uh that they're getting in their backlog uh that they're getting in their backlog uh are a waste of time and just an are a waste of time and just an are a waste of time and just an additional task that they need to do and additional task that they need to do and additional task that they need to do and that they are expected to do. Um and that they are expected to do. Um and that they are expected to do. Um and yeah that's it. Hey yeah that's it. Hey yeah that's it. Hey everyone my name is James. I recently everyone my name is James. I recently everyone my name is James. I recently founded Laciotech uh which is a resource founded Laciotech uh which is a resource founded Laciotech uh which is a resource for helping engineers find security for helping engineers find security for helping engineers find security tools. So if you want my hottest takes tools. So if you want my hottest takes tools. So if you want my hottest takes on sneak or zscaler uh feel free to let on sneak or zscaler uh feel free to let on sneak or zscaler uh feel free to let me know. Um but before that I've been in me know. Um but before that I've been in me know. Um but before that I've been in security architecture roles for uh 5 to security architecture roles for uh 5 to security architecture roles for uh 5 to 10 years from I was most recently at 10 years from I was most recently at 10 years from I was most recently at paged duty did a lot of our fed ramp paged duty did a lot of our fed ramp paged duty did a lot of our fed ramp initiatives which is enough to make initiatives which is enough to make initiatives which is enough to make anyone want to move on to another uh anyone want to move on to another uh anyone want to move on to another uh thing. And before that I was at uh thing. And before that I was at uh thing. And before that I was at uh Reliquest as well as some different Reliquest as well as some different Reliquest as well as some different startups. And so I've been in a lot of startups. And so I've been in a lot of startups. And so I've been in a lot of different sized companies and helped a different sized companies and helped a different sized companies and helped a lot of people tackle vulnerability lot of people tackle vulnerability lot of people tackle vulnerability management. And so I'm representing uh management. And so I'm representing uh management. And so I'm representing uh the executive role, not because I've the executive role, not because I've the executive role, not because I've been an executive, but because as an been an executive, but because as an been an executive, but because as an architect, I've had to work with You're architect, I've had to work with You're architect, I've had to work with You're a CEO now. Just as a CEO. Yes. As the a CEO now. Just as a CEO. Yes. As the a CEO now. Just as a CEO. Yes. As the chief executive. Um trying to help the chief executive. Um trying to help the chief executive. Um trying to help the CISO translate what they're trying to CISO translate what they're trying to CISO translate what they're trying to say into developer talk that's not going say into developer talk that's not going say into developer talk that's not going to create a riot coming out of their to create a riot coming out of their to create a riot coming out of their side of the house. And then even how side of the house. And then even how side of the house. And then even how that interfaces with product and who that interfaces with product and who that interfaces with product and who should own vulnerabilities and all of should own vulnerabilities and all of should own vulnerabilities and all of that. So, uh, how do we tie together all that. So, uh, how do we tie together all that. So, uh, how do we tie together all of these different stakeholders in a way of these different stakeholders in a way of these different stakeholders in a way that doesn't, uh, create too much of a that doesn't, uh, create too much of a that doesn't, uh, create too much of a problem along the way? So, cool. Uh, so problem along the way? So, cool. Uh, so problem along the way? So, cool. Uh, so I think we'll start with kind of I think we'll start with kind of I think we'll start with kind of understanding more about the priorities understanding more about the priorities understanding more about the priorities that that each kind of persona uh, that that each kind of persona uh, that that each kind of persona uh, brings uh, or has in its role. So, if brings uh, or has in its role. So, if brings uh, or has in its role. So, if you can each kind of describe from your you can each kind of describe from your you can each kind of describe from your perspective uh, just generally in your perspective uh, just generally in your perspective uh, just generally in your role, what are your key uh, priorities? role, what are your key uh, priorities? role, what are your key uh, priorities? Uh, Caleb. Uh, Caleb. Uh, Caleb. Um, yeah. So, in in the vulnerability Um, yeah. So, in in the vulnerability Um, yeah. So, in in the vulnerability management operator role, my main management operator role, my main management operator role, my main responsibility was vulnerability responsibility was vulnerability responsibility was vulnerability scanning. Ensure our assets are being scanning. Ensure our assets are being scanning. Ensure our assets are being scanned by the various vulnerability scanned by the various vulnerability scanned by the various vulnerability scanning tools that we had. Um, so first scanning tools that we had. Um, so first scanning tools that we had. Um, so first off, uh there's a lot that goes into off, uh there's a lot that goes into off, uh there's a lot that goes into successful vulnerability man successful vulnerability man successful vulnerability man vulnerability scanning. Um, a huge part vulnerability scanning. Um, a huge part vulnerability scanning. Um, a huge part of that is asset inventory, um, asset of that is asset inventory, um, asset of that is asset inventory, um, asset management, which is really cat hurting, management, which is really cat hurting, management, which is really cat hurting, uh, for anybody who's who's been there, uh, for anybody who's who's been there, uh, for anybody who's who's been there, done that, which I feel like is done that, which I feel like is done that, which I feel like is everybody here. Um, because as the everybody here. Um, because as the everybody here. Um, because as the vulnerability management team member, I vulnerability management team member, I vulnerability management team member, I was almost never responsible for the was almost never responsible for the was almost never responsible for the asset inventory, asset management, and asset inventory, asset management, and asset inventory, asset management, and yet the majority of my job revolved yet the majority of my job revolved yet the majority of my job revolved around that being done well. So um cat around that being done well. So um cat around that being done well. So um cat hurting in the form of asset management hurting in the form of asset management hurting in the form of asset management and then from there tool management um and then from there tool management um and then from there tool management um making sure all of my scanners were making sure all of my scanners were making sure all of my scanners were functioning properly logging on first functioning properly logging on first functioning properly logging on first thing in the morning to say uh did all thing in the morning to say uh did all thing in the morning to say uh did all my scans run overnight did any of them my scans run overnight did any of them my scans run overnight did any of them fail is the data flowing properly fail is the data flowing properly fail is the data flowing properly because the third part is communication because the third part is communication because the third part is communication of those vulnerabilities. So it's not of those vulnerabilities. So it's not of those vulnerabilities. So it's not just scanning it's then making sure that just scanning it's then making sure that just scanning it's then making sure that the vulnerabilities that are identified the vulnerabilities that are identified the vulnerabilities that are identified are getting out of that tool and into are getting out of that tool and into are getting out of that tool and into the hands of those who will be doing the the hands of those who will be doing the the hands of those who will be doing the remediating. So that kind of made me a remediating. So that kind of made me a remediating. So that kind of made me a system owner in a way because we had to system owner in a way because we had to system owner in a way because we had to build our own workflow in order to get build our own workflow in order to get build our own workflow in order to get those vulnerabilities into the right those vulnerabilities into the right those vulnerabilities into the right hands. Um but communicating hands. Um but communicating hands. Um but communicating vulnerabilities is another huge part of vulnerabilities is another huge part of vulnerabilities is another huge part of the job. Um and then of course uh you the job. Um and then of course uh you the job. Um and then of course uh you hope that risk reduction and remediation hope that risk reduction and remediation hope that risk reduction and remediation of vulnerabilities is also a core part of vulnerabilities is also a core part of vulnerabilities is also a core part of the job. But um definitely when of the job. But um definitely when of the job. But um definitely when you're in the trenches uh that hamster you're in the trenches uh that hamster you're in the trenches uh that hamster wheel gets a little bit challenging and wheel gets a little bit challenging and wheel gets a little bit challenging and and there was a lot of times where I and there was a lot of times where I and there was a lot of times where I couldn't I couldn't focus on risk couldn't I couldn't focus on risk couldn't I couldn't focus on risk reduction because there were just so reduction because there were just so reduction because there were just so many new vulnerabilities coming in um many new vulnerabilities coming in um many new vulnerabilities coming in um and just keeping track of like making and just keeping track of like making and just keeping track of like making sure the scanning is working and getting sure the scanning is working and getting sure the scanning is working and getting those vulnerabilities out that the idea those vulnerabilities out that the idea those vulnerabilities out that the idea of actually like winning the remediation of actually like winning the remediation of actually like winning the remediation game was kind of kind of out of scope game was kind of kind of out of scope game was kind of kind of out of scope for my own personal priority. Um but for my own personal priority. Um but for my own personal priority. Um but yeah that's a lot of what what my role yeah that's a lot of what what my role yeah that's a lot of what what my role the success factors in my role were. the success factors in my role were. the success factors in my role were. Um so the main priorities of uh Um so the main priorities of uh Um so the main priorities of uh developers developers developers uh are to move fast, to keep up with uh are to move fast, to keep up with uh are to move fast, to keep up with deadlines, to make sure they are working deadlines, to make sure they are working deadlines, to make sure they are working according to planning requirements. And according to planning requirements. And according to planning requirements. And I think that um like when they get those I think that um like when they get those I think that um like when they get those vulnerabilities, it's not that like they vulnerabilities, it's not that like they vulnerabilities, it's not that like they care about them, uh but it's just part care about them, uh but it's just part care about them, uh but it's just part of the big picture. And um and I think of the big picture. And um and I think of the big picture. And um and I think that um like because uh because of that that um like because uh because of that that um like because uh because of that uh they really care um to understand uh they really care um to understand uh they really care um to understand what really matters to them uh and they what really matters to them uh and they what really matters to them uh and they really want to feel like they're they're really want to feel like they're they're really want to feel like they're they're not wasting their time. So I think that not wasting their time. So I think that not wasting their time. So I think that uh the main questions they're asking uh the main questions they're asking uh the main questions they're asking themselves um are like is this even a themselves um are like is this even a themselves um are like is this even a real vulnerability or is this relevant real vulnerability or is this relevant real vulnerability or is this relevant to me in the context of my application to me in the context of my application to me in the context of my application or my project or is it just blocking my or my project or is it just blocking my or my project or is it just blocking my my pipeline for some reason and I even my pipeline for some reason and I even my pipeline for some reason and I even don't use that uh vulnerable function. don't use that uh vulnerable function. don't use that uh vulnerable function. Um so I think it's a lot about context. Um so I think it's a lot about context. Um so I think it's a lot about context. Uh and it's very important to them to Uh and it's very important to them to Uh and it's very important to them to feel like they're not putting um such feel like they're not putting um such feel like they're not putting um such efforts in fixing something that even efforts in fixing something that even efforts in fixing something that even will will not truly impact uh their will will not truly impact uh their will will not truly impact uh their application. Um and when I look at that application. Um and when I look at that application. Um and when I look at that main priority, I would say that my main priority, I would say that my main priority, I would say that my priority as an analyst is to make sure priority as an analyst is to make sure priority as an analyst is to make sure that they get those actionable things that they get those actionable things that they get those actionable things and those actionable information. uh and those actionable information. uh and those actionable information. uh meaning that um I want to focus on okay meaning that um I want to focus on okay meaning that um I want to focus on okay I have that vulnerability and that nice I have that vulnerability and that nice I have that vulnerability and that nice description that describes what the description that describes what the description that describes what the vulnerability what the vulnerability is vulnerability what the vulnerability is vulnerability what the vulnerability is doing uh but I want to make sure that doing uh but I want to make sure that doing uh but I want to make sure that they have uh what version is fixed uh they have uh what version is fixed uh they have uh what version is fixed uh with which commit also maybe uh in the with which commit also maybe uh in the with which commit also maybe uh in the open source context and uh what are the open source context and uh what are the open source context and uh what are the vulnerable conditions in which context vulnerable conditions in which context vulnerable conditions in which context uh the vulnerability is actually uh the vulnerability is actually uh the vulnerability is actually exploitable and and could could really exploitable and and could could really exploitable and and could could really impact your application Um so that's impact your application Um so that's impact your application Um so that's what I'm focusing on uh when I think what I'm focusing on uh when I think what I'm focusing on uh when I think about my priorities is like basically to about my priorities is like basically to about my priorities is like basically to help the developers to to make uh help the developers to to make uh help the developers to to make uh effective more effective and and smart effective more effective and and smart effective more effective and and smart decisions. decisions. decisions. Yeah, I think the the place that a lot Yeah, I think the the place that a lot Yeah, I think the the place that a lot of executives are in is trying to of executives are in is trying to of executives are in is trying to balance the compliance and technical balance the compliance and technical balance the compliance and technical requirements with just the business requirements with just the business requirements with just the business continuity thing where most CISOs uh are continuity thing where most CISOs uh are continuity thing where most CISOs uh are in this delicate balance of how do I in this delicate balance of how do I in this delicate balance of how do I communicate the urgency to get these communicate the urgency to get these communicate the urgency to get these vulnerabilities remediated with a team vulnerabilities remediated with a team vulnerabilities remediated with a team that has their own business priorities that has their own business priorities that has their own business priorities coming from the CEO that's to drive coming from the CEO that's to drive coming from the CEO that's to drive additional product adoption, push additional product adoption, push additional product adoption, push additional features and trying to additional features and trying to additional features and trying to navigate what's actually happening on navigate what's actually happening on navigate what's actually happening on the ground level where if all a CTO is the ground level where if all a CTO is the ground level where if all a CTO is hearing is from their developers about hearing is from their developers about hearing is from their developers about security sending me all these false security sending me all these false security sending me all these false positives, it's really slowing me down. positives, it's really slowing me down. positives, it's really slowing me down. I can't get my tickets done. Then all of I can't get my tickets done. Then all of I can't get my tickets done. Then all of a sudden that starts to create that a sudden that starts to create that a sudden that starts to create that friction that CISOs are hearing from friction that CISOs are hearing from friction that CISOs are hearing from their team. We have all these critical their team. We have all these critical their team. We have all these critical vulnerabilities that could be exploited. vulnerabilities that could be exploited. vulnerabilities that could be exploited. Our risk is super high and something's Our risk is super high and something's Our risk is super high and something's not connecting. And so it's about how not connecting. And so it's about how not connecting. And so it's about how can we communicate to the business the can we communicate to the business the can we communicate to the business the risk that we're all facing um in light risk that we're all facing um in light risk that we're all facing um in light of the second you start pulling on the of the second you start pulling on the of the second you start pulling on the vulnerability string uh the conversation vulnerability string uh the conversation vulnerability string uh the conversation gets super detailed and super technical gets super detailed and super technical gets super detailed and super technical very quickly and so it's trying to how very quickly and so it's trying to how very quickly and so it's trying to how do I highle communicate the risk to the do I highle communicate the risk to the do I highle communicate the risk to the business and the risk of this business and the risk of this business and the risk of this application we're launching what's the application we're launching what's the application we're launching what's the risk of adopting generative AI what role risk of adopting generative AI what role risk of adopting generative AI what role do vulnerabilities play in that um do vulnerabilities play in that um do vulnerabilities play in that um without the second you start talking to without the second you start talking to without the second you start talking to the architect person you're immediately the architect person you're immediately the architect person you're immediately talking about well it depends on our ML talking about well it depends on our ML talking about well it depends on our ML bomb and what models we're using and bomb and what models we're using and bomb and what models we're using and what uh different libraries and what are what uh different libraries and what are what uh different libraries and what are the CV counts and all of that. Um, it's the CV counts and all of that. Um, it's the CV counts and all of that. Um, it's really difficult to communicate the really difficult to communicate the really difficult to communicate the highlevel business use case for why highlevel business use case for why highlevel business use case for why we're doing this in the first place. Um, we're doing this in the first place. Um, we're doing this in the first place. Um, and how it fits into the sales model and and how it fits into the sales model and and how it fits into the sales model and drives revenue through compliance drives revenue through compliance drives revenue through compliance standards. Uh, while navigating like standards. Uh, while navigating like standards. Uh, while navigating like this inherent friction that exists where this inherent friction that exists where this inherent friction that exists where security teams are freaking out about security teams are freaking out about security teams are freaking out about the high levels of uh, vulnerabilities the high levels of uh, vulnerabilities the high levels of uh, vulnerabilities while the developers are saying none of while the developers are saying none of while the developers are saying none of this is actually important or impactful this is actually important or impactful this is actually important or impactful and why is it happening? and why is it happening? and why is it happening? and kind of in the context of and kind of in the context of and kind of in the context of vulnerability management what would you vulnerability management what would you vulnerability management what would you say that uh in your individual worlds uh say that uh in your individual worlds uh say that uh in your individual worlds uh are you measured on were you measured on are you measured on were you measured on are you measured on were you measured on what what are the kind of the KPIs that what what are the kind of the KPIs that what what are the kind of the KPIs that you're optimizing? Yeah. So my persona you're optimizing? Yeah. So my persona you're optimizing? Yeah. So my persona here is like the only one that's 100% uh here is like the only one that's 100% uh here is like the only one that's 100% uh revolving around vulnerability revolving around vulnerability revolving around vulnerability management. And so mine was uh 100% management. And so mine was uh 100% management. And so mine was uh 100% focused on scans running accurately, focused on scans running accurately, focused on scans running accurately, covering all assets, scanning properly, covering all assets, scanning properly, covering all assets, scanning properly, and communicating those vulnerabilities and communicating those vulnerabilities and communicating those vulnerabilities to the necessary stakeholders. And so to the necessary stakeholders. And so to the necessary stakeholders. And so that was like my my measure of success that was like my my measure of success that was like my my measure of success for vulnerability management. Um so I think when it comes to what are Um so I think when it comes to what are Um so I think when it comes to what are we measured on first of all it's we measured on first of all it's we measured on first of all it's important to say that uh developers are important to say that uh developers are important to say that uh developers are usually not uh measured on vulnerability usually not uh measured on vulnerability usually not uh measured on vulnerability management processes. uh they're uh management processes. uh they're uh management processes. uh they're uh measured on uh the fact that they keep measured on uh the fact that they keep measured on uh the fact that they keep up with the deadlines and that they're up with the deadlines and that they're up with the deadlines and that they're uh working according to the planning uh uh working according to the planning uh uh working according to the planning uh but uh but and the and the vulnerability but uh but and the and the vulnerability but uh but and the and the vulnerability they just get it as an issue in their they just get it as an issue in their they just get it as an issue in their backlog in the Jira board or something backlog in the Jira board or something backlog in the Jira board or something like that. Um so yeah I I think that um like that. Um so yeah I I think that um like that. Um so yeah I I think that um that's something that is important to that's something that is important to that's something that is important to understand. Uh and it reminds me um a understand. Uh and it reminds me um a understand. Uh and it reminds me um a discussion I had uh with a friend like discussion I had uh with a friend like discussion I had uh with a friend like two days ago um about that topic. I was two days ago um about that topic. I was two days ago um about that topic. I was saying telling her that I'm coming to saying telling her that I'm coming to saying telling her that I'm coming to the to the conference and she's a the to the conference and she's a the to the conference and she's a developer um and she was saying yeah I'm developer um and she was saying yeah I'm developer um and she was saying yeah I'm getting from the security team uh those getting from the security team uh those getting from the security team uh those bunch of vulnerabilities I'm expected to bunch of vulnerabilities I'm expected to bunch of vulnerabilities I'm expected to fix and they they telling me they say to fix and they they telling me they say to fix and they they telling me they say to me like yeah it's just two minute like me like yeah it's just two minute like me like yeah it's just two minute like just fix it and uh continue with your just fix it and uh continue with your just fix it and uh continue with your feature. Um so it really emphasized to feature. Um so it really emphasized to feature. Um so it really emphasized to to me the gap that exist between to me the gap that exist between to me the gap that exist between security teams uh and the developers. Um security teams uh and the developers. Um security teams uh and the developers. Um and I think it's really important to and I think it's really important to and I think it's really important to understand uh why context matters so understand uh why context matters so understand uh why context matters so much. Um because in that sense if you uh much. Um because in that sense if you uh much. Um because in that sense if you uh you can enlight uh the vulnerabilities you can enlight uh the vulnerabilities you can enlight uh the vulnerabilities that matters the most in the context of that matters the most in the context of that matters the most in the context of uh your application. um you can make uh your application. um you can make uh your application. um you can make sure that you put the effort and the sure that you put the effort and the sure that you put the effort and the resources um for the right and and the resources um for the right and and the resources um for the right and and the impactful uh impactful uh impactful uh vulnerabilities. Um and for the analyst vulnerabilities. Um and for the analyst vulnerabilities. Um and for the analyst perspective, what I'm measured on is of perspective, what I'm measured on is of perspective, what I'm measured on is of course actionability as I already course actionability as I already course actionability as I already mentioned, but also making sure we are mentioned, but also making sure we are mentioned, but also making sure we are not doing poor quality disclosures. Uh not doing poor quality disclosures. Uh not doing poor quality disclosures. Uh it's a real big and important topic um it's a real big and important topic um it's a real big and important topic um to ensure that we are reducing noise as to ensure that we are reducing noise as to ensure that we are reducing noise as much as possible. Um and yeah to make much as possible. Um and yeah to make much as possible. Um and yeah to make sure that we are accurate when you are sure that we are accurate when you are sure that we are accurate when you are disclosing and publishing disclosing and publishing disclosing and publishing vulnerabilities uh complete um also vulnerabilities uh complete um also vulnerabilities uh complete um also timeliness is very important you know to timeliness is very important you know to timeliness is very important you know to to make sure that uh every everyone to make sure that uh every everyone to make sure that uh every everyone knows about that vulnerability on time knows about that vulnerability on time knows about that vulnerability on time to make sure that they can they can um to make sure that they can they can um to make sure that they can they can um decide what to do with it um and what decide what to do with it um and what decide what to do with it um and what are the next steps that they want to are the next steps that they want to are the next steps that they want to take. Um yeah, I think the hard take. Um yeah, I think the hard take. Um yeah, I think the hard challenge for CISOs in terms of manage challenge for CISOs in terms of manage challenge for CISOs in terms of manage uh what they're being held to account uh what they're being held to account uh what they're being held to account for with vulnerability management is the for with vulnerability management is the for with vulnerability management is the less vulnerability scanning you do, the less vulnerability scanning you do, the less vulnerability scanning you do, the easier it is to be compliant. And so if easier it is to be compliant. And so if easier it is to be compliant. And so if the main register is uh zero the main register is uh zero the main register is uh zero vulnerabilities, well, if you don't have vulnerabilities, well, if you don't have vulnerabilities, well, if you don't have a vulnerability scanner, that's a great a vulnerability scanner, that's a great a vulnerability scanner, that's a great way to have zero vulnerabilities. Um, way to have zero vulnerabilities. Um, way to have zero vulnerabilities. Um, and a challenge that I consistently ran and a challenge that I consistently ran and a challenge that I consistently ran into as someone trying to drive cloud into as someone trying to drive cloud into as someone trying to drive cloud security programs was wanting to be an security programs was wanting to be an security programs was wanting to be an early adopter of a lot of very cool early adopter of a lot of very cool early adopter of a lot of very cool tooling that could do upstream malware tooling that could do upstream malware tooling that could do upstream malware detection, deep binary analysis, all of detection, deep binary analysis, all of detection, deep binary analysis, all of this stuff. And this is the stuff that this stuff. And this is the stuff that this stuff. And this is the stuff that gets us excited. Um, but it creates gets us excited. Um, but it creates gets us excited. Um, but it creates friction with the organizational goals friction with the organizational goals friction with the organizational goals where if I show my auditor, hey, I go 20 where if I show my auditor, hey, I go 20 where if I show my auditor, hey, I go 20 plus layers deep on transitive plus layers deep on transitive plus layers deep on transitive dependencies. Isn't that great? And then dependencies. Isn't that great? And then dependencies. Isn't that great? And then the auditor says, oh, well, what are you the auditor says, oh, well, what are you the auditor says, oh, well, what are you doing about those? And it's like, whoa, doing about those? And it's like, whoa, doing about those? And it's like, whoa, I didn't I didn't want to actually do I didn't I didn't want to actually do I didn't I didn't want to actually do anything. It's just cool that I could anything. It's just cool that I could anything. It's just cool that I could show show that they're there. Um, and I show show that they're there. Um, and I show show that they're there. Um, and I think this this creates additional think this this creates additional think this this creates additional friction, right? Because then I have all friction, right? Because then I have all friction, right? Because then I have all these vans and I'm sending them over to these vans and I'm sending them over to these vans and I'm sending them over to the dev team and they're sitting there the dev team and they're sitting there the dev team and they're sitting there like, am I supposed to go to the open like, am I supposed to go to the open like, am I supposed to go to the open source repo and patch 20 transitive source repo and patch 20 transitive source repo and patch 20 transitive dependency layers down, how to fix dependency layers down, how to fix dependency layers down, how to fix something? And so really what I've come something? And so really what I've come something? And so really what I've come to understand over time is that security to understand over time is that security to understand over time is that security leaders need to have a realistic picture leaders need to have a realistic picture leaders need to have a realistic picture of what they're trying to accomplish of what they're trying to accomplish of what they're trying to accomplish with their vulnerability program. with their vulnerability program. with their vulnerability program. um and keep an eye towards actual um and keep an eye towards actual um and keep an eye towards actual security risk reduction where you're security risk reduction where you're security risk reduction where you're investing in like leading tools and investing in like leading tools and investing in like leading tools and trying to like really lead uh strong trying to like really lead uh strong trying to like really lead uh strong initiatives while you have the initiatives while you have the initiatives while you have the day-to-day compliance operations focus. day-to-day compliance operations focus. day-to-day compliance operations focus. It's a little bit how a lot of It's a little bit how a lot of It's a little bit how a lot of organizations I've been at, well I won't organizations I've been at, well I won't organizations I've been at, well I won't say pretend I didn't say I've been at um say pretend I didn't say I've been at um say pretend I didn't say I've been at um have done different uh pentesting, have done different uh pentesting, have done different uh pentesting, right? Where one pentest is for auditors right? Where one pentest is for auditors right? Where one pentest is for auditors that you're happy to have like a zero that you're happy to have like a zero that you're happy to have like a zero result and then you bring in a boutique result and then you bring in a boutique result and then you bring in a boutique firm to do the in-depth like the real firm to do the in-depth like the real firm to do the in-depth like the real pentest, right? Um and in the same way pentest, right? Um and in the same way pentest, right? Um and in the same way in vulnerability management, we should in vulnerability management, we should in vulnerability management, we should have a view of vulnerabilities that's have a view of vulnerabilities that's have a view of vulnerabilities that's more complex than just I'm scanning my more complex than just I'm scanning my more complex than just I'm scanning my servers. That's looking at container servers. That's looking at container servers. That's looking at container images, doing deep binary analysis, all images, doing deep binary analysis, all images, doing deep binary analysis, all of that stuff. But that those of that stuff. But that those of that stuff. But that those conflicting priorities can create a lot conflicting priorities can create a lot conflicting priorities can create a lot of conflict along the way. And the other of conflict along the way. And the other of conflict along the way. And the other thing I'll say is that different thing I'll say is that different thing I'll say is that different organizations, it's just at first I organizations, it's just at first I organizations, it's just at first I thought if I can just do a a bottom up thought if I can just do a a bottom up thought if I can just do a a bottom up uh shift left revolution here that I uh shift left revolution here that I uh shift left revolution here that I would solve everything because I had would solve everything because I had would solve everything because I had great relationships with the development great relationships with the development great relationships with the development team. we were all on the same page about team. we were all on the same page about team. we were all on the same page about how the app worked, how to fix things, how the app worked, how to fix things, how the app worked, how to fix things, but um just like you were saying that but um just like you were saying that but um just like you were saying that they weren't measured on vulnerabilities they weren't measured on vulnerabilities they weren't measured on vulnerabilities and that created they wanted to fix and that created they wanted to fix and that created they wanted to fix them, but it wasn't how they were them, but it wasn't how they were them, but it wasn't how they were measured and so they just had no measured and so they just had no measured and so they just had no incentive to do it. At another incentive to do it. At another incentive to do it. At another organization I was at, we tried pure top organization I was at, we tried pure top organization I was at, we tried pure top down because hey, guess what? We're down because hey, guess what? We're down because hey, guess what? We're getting this compliance. We're going to getting this compliance. We're going to getting this compliance. We're going to do it. Um but then you just have this do it. Um but then you just have this do it. Um but then you just have this source of conflict where because of the source of conflict where because of the source of conflict where because of the number of vulnerabilities, I couldn't number of vulnerabilities, I couldn't number of vulnerabilities, I couldn't add contacts. Like the the number was add contacts. Like the the number was add contacts. Like the the number was too high. had to just send them over to too high. had to just send them over to too high. had to just send them over to the dev team. And really, it does the dev team. And really, it does the dev team. And really, it does unfortunately require both bottoms up unfortunately require both bottoms up unfortunately require both bottoms up and tops down approaches where the and tops down approaches where the and tops down approaches where the executive team has to be aligned on executive team has to be aligned on executive team has to be aligned on here's how you're going to be uh managed here's how you're going to be uh managed here's how you're going to be uh managed and set organizational priorities for and set organizational priorities for and set organizational priorities for how we're doing this. And you have to how we're doing this. And you have to how we're doing this. And you have to have the bottom level relationship so have the bottom level relationship so have the bottom level relationship so that when a developer talks to a that when a developer talks to a that when a developer talks to a security engineer, they're not wondering security engineer, they're not wondering security engineer, they're not wondering like does this person even know what like does this person even know what like does this person even know what they're doing? Um because it's so they're doing? Um because it's so they're doing? Um because it's so disconnected from the day-to-day disconnected from the day-to-day disconnected from the day-to-day experience. And I think that's the experience. And I think that's the experience. And I think that's the challenge that executives face is trying challenge that executives face is trying challenge that executives face is trying to tie those uh realities together. to tie those uh realities together. to tie those uh realities together. Yeah, for sure. So I think just just by Yeah, for sure. So I think just just by Yeah, for sure. So I think just just by uh each of the personas are kind of uh each of the personas are kind of uh each of the personas are kind of articulating what they're measured on articulating what they're measured on articulating what they're measured on and and what's important to them, we can and and what's important to them, we can and and what's important to them, we can already see kind of where the the already see kind of where the the already see kind of where the the friction points are and and what can be friction points are and and what can be friction points are and and what can be the challenges um in terms of kind of the challenges um in terms of kind of the challenges um in terms of kind of the how the organi organization manages the how the organi organization manages the how the organi organization manages vulnerability management. Um, and I'd vulnerability management. Um, and I'd vulnerability management. Um, and I'd like I'd like us to kind of dive deeper like I'd like us to kind of dive deeper like I'd like us to kind of dive deeper into that uh topic and I'm I'm kind of into that uh topic and I'm I'm kind of into that uh topic and I'm I'm kind of I'm going to throw out some specific I'm going to throw out some specific I'm going to throw out some specific topics and would like to get your topics and would like to get your topics and would like to get your different perspective on them. Uh, different perspective on them. Uh, different perspective on them. Uh, starting with um the I think the starting with um the I think the starting with um the I think the vulnerability management number one uh vulnerability management number one uh vulnerability management number one uh most talked about issue is false most talked about issue is false most talked about issue is false positives. Uh, Kayla, how did you see positives. Uh, Kayla, how did you see positives. Uh, Kayla, how did you see false positives from your perspective as false positives from your perspective as false positives from your perspective as an operator? an operator? an operator? So, when I first got in the role um of So, when I first got in the role um of So, when I first got in the role um of vulnerability scanning, it was most vulnerability scanning, it was most vulnerability scanning, it was most certainly uh the perspective of certainly uh the perspective of certainly uh the perspective of everybody else that everybody else that everybody else that every vulnerability I gave them was a every vulnerability I gave them was a every vulnerability I gave them was a false positive for sure. They weren't false positive for sure. They weren't false positive for sure. They weren't even going to question it. They were even going to question it. They were even going to question it. They were like, "Nope, fake news. Don't need it." like, "Nope, fake news. Don't need it." like, "Nope, fake news. Don't need it." And so it took me a while to build And so it took me a while to build And so it took me a while to build relationships with those audiences and relationships with those audiences and relationships with those audiences and then for me to also learn to trust my then for me to also learn to trust my then for me to also learn to trust my scanner to say to have confidence going scanner to say to have confidence going scanner to say to have confidence going to these teams to say okay well it found to these teams to say okay well it found to these teams to say okay well it found something. Let's negotiate on what we something. Let's negotiate on what we something. Let's negotiate on what we mean by false positive. Right? There's mean by false positive. Right? There's mean by false positive. Right? There's there's a variance in the definition of there's a variance in the definition of there's a variance in the definition of false positive. Um, so and I uh I know false positive. Um, so and I uh I know false positive. Um, so and I uh I know we have like a lot of of topics to we have like a lot of of topics to we have like a lot of of topics to continue on to. So I won't get too deep continue on to. So I won't get too deep continue on to. So I won't get too deep into like definitions of of what into like definitions of of what into like definitions of of what actually means risk or anything like actually means risk or anything like actually means risk or anything like that yet. Um, but I had to learn to that yet. Um, but I had to learn to that yet. Um, but I had to learn to trust my scanner so that when I went up trust my scanner so that when I went up trust my scanner so that when I went up into an argument with an application into an argument with an application into an argument with an application owner or developer, I could say, "All owner or developer, I could say, "All owner or developer, I could say, "All right, well, let's dig into the weeds. right, well, let's dig into the weeds. right, well, let's dig into the weeds. What did the scanner find and where did What did the scanner find and where did What did the scanner find and where did it find it? I can look that data up. You it find it? I can look that data up. You it find it? I can look that data up. You show me what's on your system. Let's do show me what's on your system. Let's do show me what's on your system. Let's do a screen share here. You prove to me a screen share here. You prove to me a screen share here. You prove to me that this is actually a false positive. that this is actually a false positive. that this is actually a false positive. So that relationship was critical to So that relationship was critical to So that relationship was critical to being able to overcome the false being able to overcome the false being able to overcome the false positive arguments because I spent so positive arguments because I spent so positive arguments because I spent so much time so much time handholding much time so much time handholding much time so much time handholding application owners and developers application owners and developers application owners and developers saying, "Okay, but we found something. saying, "Okay, but we found something. saying, "Okay, but we found something. So let's dig into what that actually So let's dig into what that actually So let's dig into what that actually is." Um and then of course you know it is." Um and then of course you know it is." Um and then of course you know it whether it was well we've just decided whether it was well we've just decided whether it was well we've just decided to do it differently. It's not a real to do it differently. It's not a real to do it differently. It's not a real vulnerability. So you know that vulnerability. So you know that vulnerability. So you know that definition of false positive. In the end definition of false positive. In the end definition of false positive. In the end we had to choose a place to start as a we had to choose a place to start as a we had to choose a place to start as a security team as a vulnerability security team as a vulnerability security team as a vulnerability management organization. And and our management organization. And and our management organization. And and our choice was if the scanner finds it and choice was if the scanner finds it and choice was if the scanner finds it and you cannot prove to me that it's a false you cannot prove to me that it's a false you cannot prove to me that it's a false positive, you have to remediate it based positive, you have to remediate it based positive, you have to remediate it based on the severity of the scanner, you on the severity of the scanner, you on the severity of the scanner, you know. So like I think now in my wiser know. So like I think now in my wiser know. So like I think now in my wiser years now maybe I'd have a little bit years now maybe I'd have a little bit years now maybe I'd have a little bit more conversation around well more conversation around well more conversation around well reachability and you know what's the reachability and you know what's the reachability and you know what's the priority of this but um back in the day priority of this but um back in the day priority of this but um back in the day it was definitely like if the scanner it was definitely like if the scanner it was definitely like if the scanner says it's there it's there unless you says it's there it's there unless you says it's there it's there unless you can prove it's not. Would you say that can prove it's not. Would you say that can prove it's not. Would you say that you said your kind of way to handle this you said your kind of way to handle this you said your kind of way to handle this was trust your scanner more. Would you was trust your scanner more. Would you was trust your scanner more. Would you say that you got to a point where you say that you got to a point where you say that you got to a point where you trust your scanner too much at times? trust your scanner too much at times? trust your scanner too much at times? Yes definitely for sure. And then and Yes definitely for sure. And then and Yes definitely for sure. And then and but that's where I always checked myself but that's where I always checked myself but that's where I always checked myself to have a a screen share with the to have a a screen share with the to have a a screen share with the application owners. Like building that application owners. Like building that application owners. Like building that relationship was huge. They knew they relationship was huge. They knew they relationship was huge. They knew they could trust me and I could trust them could trust me and I could trust them could trust me and I could trust them for all of us to bring proof to the for all of us to bring proof to the for all of us to bring proof to the table. Like that was really where it table. Like that was really where it table. Like that was really where it mattered. Um but I would always take mattered. Um but I would always take mattered. Um but I would always take this side of my scanner this side of my scanner this side of my scanner first naturally. Yeah. first naturally. Yeah. first naturally. Yeah. Um so when it comes to false positives Um so when it comes to false positives Um so when it comes to false positives um the definition by the way of false um the definition by the way of false um the definition by the way of false positives that I want to refer to um positives that I want to refer to um positives that I want to refer to um today is uh like when we have a real today is uh like when we have a real today is uh like when we have a real vulnerability it is there it exists vulnerability it is there it exists vulnerability it is there it exists there is one um but in the context of there is one um but in the context of there is one um but in the context of your application it's not relevant um your application it's not relevant um your application it's not relevant um and I think that that's like to me it's and I think that that's like to me it's and I think that that's like to me it's the most challenging thing to do Um the most challenging thing to do Um the most challenging thing to do Um because uh at the end of the day we have because uh at the end of the day we have because uh at the end of the day we have uh like it's a never- ending story. We uh like it's a never- ending story. We uh like it's a never- ending story. We will always have more vulnerabilities will always have more vulnerabilities will always have more vulnerabilities and and more things to fix. Um and we and and more things to fix. Um and we and and more things to fix. Um and we want to to make sure um that we um add want to to make sure um that we um add want to to make sure um that we um add enough context informations uh about the enough context informations uh about the enough context informations uh about the vulnerability. Um and that we have vulnerability. Um and that we have vulnerability. Um and that we have visibility also uh on uh on the runtime visibility also uh on uh on the runtime visibility also uh on uh on the runtime factors or uh also on the environment factors or uh also on the environment factors or uh also on the environment where the vulnerability exists to where the vulnerability exists to where the vulnerability exists to understand understand understand um like okay we have the vulner like the um like okay we have the vulner like the um like okay we have the vulner like the the scanning found the vulnerability but the scanning found the vulnerability but the scanning found the vulnerability but now we want to know if uh it's a it's an now we want to know if uh it's a it's an now we want to know if uh it's a it's an actual vulnerability in the context of actual vulnerability in the context of actual vulnerability in the context of the application. I and I think that the application. I and I think that the application. I and I think that that's really important. I see a lot of that's really important. I see a lot of that's really important. I see a lot of times vulnerabilities that are relevant times vulnerabilities that are relevant times vulnerabilities that are relevant only uh on a specific OS or uh on a only uh on a specific OS or uh on a only uh on a specific OS or uh on a specific environment and if you didn't specific environment and if you didn't specific environment and if you didn't set up that environment the set up that environment the set up that environment the vulnerability is not relevant. Um so I vulnerability is not relevant. Um so I vulnerability is not relevant. Um so I think that that's really important think that that's really important think that that's really important because if you're just looking at the because if you're just looking at the because if you're just looking at the vulnerability kind of metadata um you vulnerability kind of metadata um you vulnerability kind of metadata um you will just keep up with reacting to noise will just keep up with reacting to noise will just keep up with reacting to noise uh and focusing uh on the context. in uh and focusing uh on the context. in uh and focusing uh on the context. in addition to the vulnerability metadata addition to the vulnerability metadata addition to the vulnerability metadata of course um will help I think reduce of course um will help I think reduce of course um will help I think reduce that noise and uh make vulnerability that noise and uh make vulnerability that noise and uh make vulnerability management more effective. So I think management more effective. So I think management more effective. So I think it's an important thing. Yeah, I think it's an important thing. Yeah, I think it's an important thing. Yeah, I think the answer here has to be split the answer here has to be split the answer here has to be split between if you you're either under between if you you're either under between if you you're either under regulations where you have to fix regulations where you have to fix regulations where you have to fix vulnerabilities or you're not. And if vulnerabilities or you're not. And if vulnerabilities or you're not. And if you have to fix them, uh, then it's you have to fix them, uh, then it's you have to fix them, uh, then it's about changing the conversations with about changing the conversations with about changing the conversations with developers because I think developers developers because I think developers developers because I think developers will always look at a vulnerability and will always look at a vulnerability and will always look at a vulnerability and think in terms of exploitability rather think in terms of exploitability rather think in terms of exploitability rather than like to them it is a false positive than like to them it is a false positive than like to them it is a false positive even though I'm using a vulnerable even though I'm using a vulnerable even though I'm using a vulnerable version if I can't get an exploit version if I can't get an exploit version if I can't get an exploit across. And I view that's the goal of across. And I view that's the goal of across. And I view that's the goal of reachability and all these different reachability and all these different reachability and all these different tools that are out there and like the tools that are out there and like the tools that are out there and like the buzzword of the month or whatever is buzzword of the month or whatever is buzzword of the month or whatever is trying to show is this exploitable in my trying to show is this exploitable in my trying to show is this exploitable in my system or not. And if you're operating system or not. And if you're operating system or not. And if you're operating at such a scale, like the developer has at such a scale, like the developer has at such a scale, like the developer has to be convinced like you are not going to be convinced like you are not going to be convinced like you are not going to be able to create a satisfactory to be able to create a satisfactory to be able to create a satisfactory paper trail for every one of these paper trail for every one of these paper trail for every one of these vulnerabilities to prove that it's an vulnerabilities to prove that it's an vulnerabilities to prove that it's an exploitable issue or not. Like it's just exploitable issue or not. Like it's just exploitable issue or not. Like it's just not going to happen. Um, and so the real not going to happen. Um, and so the real not going to happen. Um, and so the real thing you're trying to build, and this thing you're trying to build, and this thing you're trying to build, and this is what I think applies outside of uh is what I think applies outside of uh is what I think applies outside of uh more regulated industries, is we're more regulated industries, is we're more regulated industries, is we're really talking about building patch really talking about building patch really talking about building patch management in general. And I think management in general. And I think management in general. And I think that's why we've gotten so confused on that's why we've gotten so confused on that's why we've gotten so confused on container security and open source container security and open source container security and open source security in in particular because in security in in particular because in security in in particular because in Windows systems everybody has a well- Windows systems everybody has a well- Windows systems everybody has a well- definfined patching structure for it's definfined patching structure for it's definfined patching structure for it's patch Tuesday and we have a control patch Tuesday and we have a control patch Tuesday and we have a control group and we run the test there and then group and we run the test there and then group and we run the test there and then we roll it out downstream. Um but when we roll it out downstream. Um but when we roll it out downstream. Um but when you bring that to the application level you bring that to the application level you bring that to the application level you've got totally different application you've got totally different application you've got totally different application teams architectures patching uh how teams architectures patching uh how teams architectures patching uh how ephemeral their infrastructure is who ephemeral their infrastructure is who ephemeral their infrastructure is who even has access to the infrastructure even has access to the infrastructure even has access to the infrastructure what developers still there. And so what developers still there. And so what developers still there. And so really, it's about trying to help really, it's about trying to help really, it's about trying to help developers think in terms of um these developers think in terms of um these developers think in terms of um these these tickets are going to keep coming these tickets are going to keep coming these tickets are going to keep coming and how can we just make it so that it's and how can we just make it so that it's and how can we just make it so that it's not a big deal when they show up. So not a big deal when they show up. So not a big deal when they show up. So we're just like rebuilding our container we're just like rebuilding our container we're just like rebuilding our container images every night. We're trying to push images every night. We're trying to push images every night. We're trying to push towards a more ephemeral architecture. towards a more ephemeral architecture. towards a more ephemeral architecture. Um which is going to take time, but Um which is going to take time, but Um which is going to take time, but that's the goal. The goal is not how can that's the goal. The goal is not how can that's the goal. The goal is not how can I prove that every single CVE is I prove that every single CVE is I prove that every single CVE is exploitable or not, but it's how can we exploitable or not, but it's how can we exploitable or not, but it's how can we make it so that every time we get one of make it so that every time we get one of make it so that every time we get one of these tickets, it's not creating a one these tickets, it's not creating a one these tickets, it's not creating a one week, two week, 3 week long ordeal where week, two week, 3 week long ordeal where week, two week, 3 week long ordeal where we're having to have these conversations we're having to have these conversations we're having to have these conversations back and forth. Um, so really that's back and forth. Um, so really that's back and forth. Um, so really that's what I try to emphasize is even before what I try to emphasize is even before what I try to emphasize is even before especially smaller organizations buying especially smaller organizations buying especially smaller organizations buying more vulnerability scanners really we more vulnerability scanners really we more vulnerability scanners really we should start by thinking about how we should start by thinking about how we should start by thinking about how we want to do patch management um before we want to do patch management um before we want to do patch management um before we start worrying about the specifics of start worrying about the specifics of start worrying about the specifics of like what vulnerabilities are we like what vulnerabilities are we like what vulnerabilities are we uncovering. Um because I know I can uncovering. Um because I know I can uncovering. Um because I know I can speak for myself that I bought a lot of speak for myself that I bought a lot of speak for myself that I bought a lot of vulnerability tools before I had an idea vulnerability tools before I had an idea vulnerability tools before I had an idea of okay how am I going to actually fix of okay how am I going to actually fix of okay how am I going to actually fix one of these? Um, and it's because of one of these? Um, and it's because of one of these? Um, and it's because of that developer disconnect where uh I that developer disconnect where uh I that developer disconnect where uh I assumed when I sent a SQL injection assumed when I sent a SQL injection assumed when I sent a SQL injection finding to a developer, they would know finding to a developer, they would know finding to a developer, they would know how to fix it. And then I found out the how to fix it. And then I found out the how to fix it. And then I found out the hard way like, oh, not all the time. Um, hard way like, oh, not all the time. Um, hard way like, oh, not all the time. Um, so yeah. Mhm. Okay. So that's false so yeah. Mhm. Okay. So that's false so yeah. Mhm. Okay. So that's false positives. What about false negatives? positives. What about false negatives? positives. What about false negatives? So, uh, I false negatives did not keep So, uh, I false negatives did not keep So, uh, I false negatives did not keep me up at night. Um, because of the level me up at night. Um, because of the level me up at night. Um, because of the level that I was at, the operator in the that I was at, the operator in the that I was at, the operator in the trenches. If my scanner didn't find it, trenches. If my scanner didn't find it, trenches. If my scanner didn't find it, then it wasn't a problem. And it's then it wasn't a problem. And it's then it wasn't a problem. And it's definitely not my problem if something definitely not my problem if something definitely not my problem if something showed up later because my scanner showed up later because my scanner showed up later because my scanner didn't find it. I'm not saying that's didn't find it. I'm not saying that's didn't find it. I'm not saying that's the right perspective to take. I'm not the right perspective to take. I'm not the right perspective to take. I'm not saying that that's, you know, how saying that that's, you know, how saying that that's, you know, how everybody every persona needs to think everybody every persona needs to think everybody every persona needs to think about false positives, but that was the about false positives, but that was the about false positives, but that was the truth. So I I have to intervene here truth. So I I have to intervene here truth. So I I have to intervene here because for me, I think actually that because for me, I think actually that because for me, I think actually that that's one of the the the one of the that's one of the the the one of the that's one of the the the one of the main problems in this process. I think main problems in this process. I think main problems in this process. I think uh in my previous company we had a uh in my previous company we had a uh in my previous company we had a conversation with the client and he says conversation with the client and he says conversation with the client and he says he said like I like scanner x whatever he said like I like scanner x whatever he said like I like scanner x whatever because they don't give me a lot of because they don't give me a lot of because they don't give me a lot of results and I'm results and I'm results and I'm like like do you care about the number like like do you care about the number like like do you care about the number of vulnerabilities or do you care about of vulnerabilities or do you care about of vulnerabilities or do you care about your actual security risk and I think your actual security risk and I think your actual security risk and I think that is also something that you don't that is also something that you don't that is also something that you don't really have visibility to when you only really have visibility to when you only really have visibility to when you only use one tool um so you don't basically use one tool um so you don't basically use one tool um so you don't basically false negatives create security blind false negatives create security blind false negatives create security blind spots in your organization because you spots in your organization because you spots in your organization because you can't fix what you don't know that can't fix what you don't know that can't fix what you don't know that exists. Um and for me what kind of exists. Um and for me what kind of exists. Um and for me what kind of really highlighted the the depth of this really highlighted the the depth of this really highlighted the the depth of this problem in the industry is again my problem in the industry is again my problem in the industry is again my previous role I did a research kind of a previous role I did a research kind of a previous role I did a research kind of a benchmark of different uh vulnerability benchmark of different uh vulnerability benchmark of different uh vulnerability scanners and SCA tools and and I was scanners and SCA tools and and I was scanners and SCA tools and and I was blown away negatively from the from the blown away negatively from the from the blown away negatively from the from the results or lack thereof and and again results or lack thereof and and again results or lack thereof and and again you don't really get visibility into you don't really get visibility into you don't really get visibility into that until you kind of put the results that until you kind of put the results that until you kind of put the results side by side and then you see okay this side by side and then you see okay this side by side and then you see okay this scanner flagged this thing and all the scanner flagged this thing and all the scanner flagged this thing and all the other missed it and then oh okay it's other missed it and then oh okay it's other missed it and then oh okay it's actually there and then then you you you actually there and then then you you you actually there and then then you you you suddenly start to see like the everybody suddenly start to see like the everybody suddenly start to see like the everybody lies. That's the that's the the takeaway lies. That's the that's the the takeaway lies. That's the that's the the takeaway that I got from my research. Well, I that I got from my research. Well, I that I got from my research. Well, I think it makes it uh if there's any think it makes it uh if there's any think it makes it uh if there's any auditors in the room, the the difficulty auditors in the room, the the difficulty auditors in the room, the the difficulty with Fed Ramp specifically is having to with Fed Ramp specifically is having to with Fed Ramp specifically is having to create then that audit trail of okay, I create then that audit trail of okay, I create then that audit trail of okay, I have to explain to an auditor why did have to explain to an auditor why did have to explain to an auditor why did why did this scanner find these why did this scanner find these why did this scanner find these vulnerabilities and then why did this vulnerabilities and then why did this vulnerabilities and then why did this one not find those ones even though it one not find those ones even though it one not find those ones even though it found additional ones, but it's so much found additional ones, but it's so much found additional ones, but it's so much paperwork to have to try to show like paperwork to have to try to show like paperwork to have to try to show like I'm basically guessing on the vendor I'm basically guessing on the vendor I'm basically guessing on the vendor side like why did this scanner find it side like why did this scanner find it side like why did this scanner find it but this one didn't. um that it's even but this one didn't. um that it's even but this one didn't. um that it's even hard to try to switch tools when you're hard to try to switch tools when you're hard to try to switch tools when you're at that level of regulation. at that level of regulation. at that level of regulation. Cool. Hava, from from your perspective, Cool. Hava, from from your perspective, Cool. Hava, from from your perspective, yeah. Um I I think that uh false yeah. Um I I think that uh false yeah. Um I I think that uh false negatives, as you mentioned, negatives, as you mentioned, negatives, as you mentioned, um are the most tricky ones. Um, and in um are the most tricky ones. Um, and in um are the most tricky ones. Um, and in a sense to me it's it's the most I don't a sense to me it's it's the most I don't a sense to me it's it's the most I don't know if the most but it's very know if the most but it's very know if the most but it's very interesting because um when you don't interesting because um when you don't interesting because um when you don't know there's a vulnerability then you know there's a vulnerability then you know there's a vulnerability then you don't get the chance to decide on what don't get the chance to decide on what don't get the chance to decide on what to do next. Um, and when I was working to do next. Um, and when I was working to do next. Um, and when I was working on a project at Sneak, I I saw that even on a project at Sneak, I I saw that even on a project at Sneak, I I saw that even when we know about a vulnerability, a when we know about a vulnerability, a when we know about a vulnerability, a lot of times, uh, we don't know, we lot of times, uh, we don't know, we lot of times, uh, we don't know, we don't have enough information at first, don't have enough information at first, don't have enough information at first, um, we don't know if there's an exploit um, we don't know if there's an exploit um, we don't know if there's an exploit or what is the maturity level of the or what is the maturity level of the or what is the maturity level of the exploit because we didn't find the proof exploit because we didn't find the proof exploit because we didn't find the proof of that. Uh, we don't know exactly uh of that. Uh, we don't know exactly uh of that. Uh, we don't know exactly uh the the vulnerable conditions or like the the vulnerable conditions or like the the vulnerable conditions or like there are stuff that are missing. Um and there are stuff that are missing. Um and there are stuff that are missing. Um and and it's at that stage that it hit me and it's at that stage that it hit me and it's at that stage that it hit me that um when you don't know it could be that um when you don't know it could be that um when you don't know it could be worse than knowing that there is a worse than knowing that there is a worse than knowing that there is a vulnerability. And I get that uh false vulnerability. And I get that uh false vulnerability. And I get that uh false positives are are very annoying because positives are are very annoying because positives are are very annoying because there's a lot of them and I get that there's a lot of them and I get that there's a lot of them and I get that there's a lot of vulnerabilities but at there's a lot of vulnerabilities but at there's a lot of vulnerabilities but at least we know and at least we have least we know and at least we have least we know and at least we have visibility and we can uh decide and take visibility and we can uh decide and take visibility and we can uh decide and take actions accordingly. Um when we don't actions accordingly. Um when we don't actions accordingly. Um when we don't know uh we don't get to decide. Um and know uh we don't get to decide. Um and know uh we don't get to decide. Um and and I really agree with what you said and I really agree with what you said and I really agree with what you said like there's a lot of assets or packages like there's a lot of assets or packages like there's a lot of assets or packages also in open source that seems pretty also in open source that seems pretty also in open source that seems pretty secure because there are not a lot of secure because there are not a lot of secure because there are not a lot of vulnerability in there but it might just vulnerability in there but it might just vulnerability in there but it might just mean that we didn't um looked at it mean that we didn't um looked at it mean that we didn't um looked at it enough. Uh yeah totally. Well, that's enough. Uh yeah totally. Well, that's enough. Uh yeah totally. Well, that's what I'll add is uh we don't usually what I'll add is uh we don't usually what I'll add is uh we don't usually think of these as false negatives, but I think of these as false negatives, but I think of these as false negatives, but I think because of the emphasis from the think because of the emphasis from the think because of the emphasis from the vendor side on CVE specifically, like it vendor side on CVE specifically, like it vendor side on CVE specifically, like it gets to the supply when we think about gets to the supply when we think about gets to the supply when we think about our supply chain security, a lot of our supply chain security, a lot of our supply chain security, a lot of organizations equate that to CVE organizations equate that to CVE organizations equate that to CVE scanning. Um, and it really misses the scanning. Um, and it really misses the scanning. Um, and it really misses the biggest risks to supply chain, which are biggest risks to supply chain, which are biggest risks to supply chain, which are like the XZ utils incident, the TJ like the XZ utils incident, the TJ like the XZ utils incident, the TJ actions incident. like these these actions incident. like these these actions incident. like these these supply chain incidents that are like supply chain incidents that are like supply chain incidents that are like really really scary and dangerous have really really scary and dangerous have really really scary and dangerous have nothing to do with CBE discovery in the nothing to do with CBE discovery in the nothing to do with CBE discovery in the first place. Um, and it requires a much first place. Um, and it requires a much first place. Um, and it requires a much more difficult look at how we're using more difficult look at how we're using more difficult look at how we're using open source to say uh is this just open source to say uh is this just open source to say uh is this just maintained by one guy named TJ and maintained by one guy named TJ and maintained by one guy named TJ and that's why it's called TJ actions and that's why it's called TJ actions and that's why it's called TJ actions and like should we use this? Um or like but like should we use this? Um or like but like should we use this? Um or like but it didn't have any CVEs and so you know it didn't have any CVEs and so you know it didn't have any CVEs and so you know it it's fine. Yeah, I think I think that it it's fine. Yeah, I think I think that it it's fine. Yeah, I think I think that that's that's a great point. I also see that's that's a great point. I also see that's that's a great point. I also see kind of a a gap or uh uh a bit of kind of a a gap or uh uh a bit of kind of a a gap or uh uh a bit of mistreatment sometimes into this entire mistreatment sometimes into this entire mistreatment sometimes into this entire kind of supply chain risk where people kind of supply chain risk where people kind of supply chain risk where people treat um treat um treat um um um malicious packages the same way um um malicious packages the same way um um malicious packages the same way that they treat CVEes, but they're not that they treat CVEes, but they're not that they treat CVEes, but they're not really the same because if you have a really the same because if you have a really the same because if you have a malicious malicious package installed in malicious malicious package installed in malicious malicious package installed in your environment, it's kind of like you your environment, it's kind of like you your environment, it's kind of like you you already have the the payload there. you already have the the payload there. you already have the the payload there. So um it's not a it's kind of a CV and So um it's not a it's kind of a CV and So um it's not a it's kind of a CV and exploit combined. So you need to see exploit combined. So you need to see exploit combined. So you need to see whether this thing actually ran. What whether this thing actually ran. What whether this thing actually ran. What did it do? You you get into this whole did it do? You you get into this whole did it do? You you get into this whole phase of kind of incident response and phase of kind of incident response and phase of kind of incident response and and a different level of triage and a a and a different level of triage and a a and a different level of triage and a a lot maybe we'll talk about it when we lot maybe we'll talk about it when we lot maybe we'll talk about it when we get about it when we get to the tools, get about it when we get to the tools, get about it when we get to the tools, but I think a lot of tools kind of try but I think a lot of tools kind of try but I think a lot of tools kind of try to have it all and then they kind of to have it all and then they kind of to have it all and then they kind of wrongfully treat those two different wrongfully treat those two different wrongfully treat those two different beasts the same. It's hard to uh when beasts the same. It's hard to uh when beasts the same. It's hard to uh when someone shows you a threat intel feed, someone shows you a threat intel feed, someone shows you a threat intel feed, that's not the aha moment for I need to that's not the aha moment for I need to that's not the aha moment for I need to buy this product right away. And that's buy this product right away. And that's buy this product right away. And that's but like that's where a lot of the juice but like that's where a lot of the juice but like that's where a lot of the juice of a good preventative security thing. of a good preventative security thing. of a good preventative security thing. Um and Um and Um and so maybe let's talk about um kind of so maybe let's talk about um kind of so maybe let's talk about um kind of tapping into that. Um what are the tapping into that. Um what are the tapping into that. Um what are the differences in from your perspectives um differences in from your perspectives um differences in from your perspectives um in terms of uh how do we scan, where do in terms of uh how do we scan, where do in terms of uh how do we scan, where do we scan, how do we aggregate the results we scan, how do we aggregate the results we scan, how do we aggregate the results kind of uh because we all know there are kind of uh because we all know there are kind of uh because we all know there are different type of scanners um and all different type of scanners um and all different type of scanners um and all kind of have their advantages and kind of have their advantages and kind of have their advantages and disadvantages. So maybe James if you can disadvantages. So maybe James if you can disadvantages. So maybe James if you can talk a bit about that. Yeah, I mean I talk a bit about that. Yeah, I mean I talk a bit about that. Yeah, I mean I always tried to separate the developer always tried to separate the developer always tried to separate the developer experience from my experience as a experience from my experience as a experience from my experience as a security engineer. And so I was always security engineer. And so I was always security engineer. And so I was always trying to get them to interface with trying to get them to interface with trying to get them to interface with whatever lightweight hooks into their whatever lightweight hooks into their whatever lightweight hooks into their environment exist knowing that it was environment exist knowing that it was environment exist knowing that it was going to miss some things, knowing that going to miss some things, knowing that going to miss some things, knowing that it wasn't um like a simple example is a it wasn't um like a simple example is a it wasn't um like a simple example is a lot of SCA tools when they integrate to lot of SCA tools when they integrate to lot of SCA tools when they integrate to a GitHub repo are looking at the a GitHub repo are looking at the a GitHub repo are looking at the instructions for how to build the binary instructions for how to build the binary instructions for how to build the binary which will miss things. than if you were which will miss things. than if you were which will miss things. than if you were to actually scan the binary when it was to actually scan the binary when it was to actually scan the binary when it was done, you're going to get a totally done, you're going to get a totally done, you're going to get a totally different uh set of results that's a lot different uh set of results that's a lot different uh set of results that's a lot more complicated to unravel. But I more complicated to unravel. But I more complicated to unravel. But I wanted developers to just focus on the wanted developers to just focus on the wanted developers to just focus on the simple that's there to get them thinking simple that's there to get them thinking simple that's there to get them thinking in terms of uh the patch management. How in terms of uh the patch management. How in terms of uh the patch management. How are we going to fix these things? Should are we going to fix these things? Should are we going to fix these things? Should I be importing this new package? Should I be importing this new package? Should I be importing this new package? Should I be using this new uh line of code? Um I be using this new uh line of code? Um I be using this new uh line of code? Um and getting them to use that stuff. And and getting them to use that stuff. And and getting them to use that stuff. And then I would always keep the deeper then I would always keep the deeper then I would always keep the deeper analysis scanning just for my own uh analysis scanning just for my own uh analysis scanning just for my own uh safety. And I wouldn't bring it up to safety. And I wouldn't bring it up to safety. And I wouldn't bring it up to auditors or whoever. It was just so that auditors or whoever. It was just so that auditors or whoever. It was just so that when log forj happened, I could at least when log forj happened, I could at least when log forj happened, I could at least actually know like where is this thing actually know like where is this thing actually know like where is this thing deployed in my environment uh at the end deployed in my environment uh at the end deployed in my environment uh at the end of the day like the source of truth. And of the day like the source of truth. And of the day like the source of truth. And so uh there are a lot of cool things um so uh there are a lot of cool things um so uh there are a lot of cool things um that you can do when you hit that level that you can do when you hit that level that you can do when you hit that level of data. And then especially when you're of data. And then especially when you're of data. And then especially when you're doing uh some of the emerging doing uh some of the emerging doing uh some of the emerging technologies around like runtime technologies around like runtime technologies around like runtime function level uh reachability where you function level uh reachability where you function level uh reachability where you can actually see like what functions can actually see like what functions can actually see like what functions from an application are executing at from an application are executing at from an application are executing at runtime and then use that to tie into runtime and then use that to tie into runtime and then use that to tie into your overall prioritization of your your overall prioritization of your your overall prioritization of your program. Um really it's about how all of program. Um really it's about how all of program. Um really it's about how all of this data depending on where you scan is this data depending on where you scan is this data depending on where you scan is going to look different. um when you going to look different. um when you going to look different. um when you look at a CI/CD pipeline of like the look at a CI/CD pipeline of like the look at a CI/CD pipeline of like the binary is getting built and then it's binary is getting built and then it's binary is getting built and then it's getting deployed and in between that getting deployed and in between that getting deployed and in between that maybe the DevOps team has built a little maybe the DevOps team has built a little maybe the DevOps team has built a little injector that's putting a fun little injector that's putting a fun little injector that's putting a fun little script in there for you to find later. script in there for you to find later. script in there for you to find later. Uh you really need the visibility every Uh you really need the visibility every Uh you really need the visibility every step of the way but then the aggregation step of the way but then the aggregation step of the way but then the aggregation point comes down to prioritization for point comes down to prioritization for point comes down to prioritization for you but then getting a relevant finding you but then getting a relevant finding you but then getting a relevant finding to the relevant developer uh in a way to the relevant developer uh in a way to the relevant developer uh in a way that's going to not create a lot of that's going to not create a lot of that's going to not create a lot of friction and that's not going to be friction and that's not going to be friction and that's not going to be super confusing. Um because a lot of super confusing. Um because a lot of super confusing. Um because a lot of junior developers will have no idea what junior developers will have no idea what junior developers will have no idea what their application actually looks like their application actually looks like their application actually looks like when it's finally deployed because it when it's finally deployed because it when it's finally deployed because it goes through so many build steps along goes through so many build steps along goes through so many build steps along the way um that they're it trying to the way um that they're it trying to the way um that they're it trying to find the right person to fix any one of find the right person to fix any one of find the right person to fix any one of those vulnerabilities can be really those vulnerabilities can be really those vulnerabilities can be really really diff difficult. Um so you need really diff difficult. Um so you need really diff difficult. Um so you need the whole visibility for yourself and the whole visibility for yourself and the whole visibility for yourself and then you can kind of pick based on the then you can kind of pick based on the then you can kind of pick based on the team how am I dduplicating these team how am I dduplicating these team how am I dduplicating these findings between different tools? How am findings between different tools? How am findings between different tools? How am I getting them to the right person? I getting them to the right person? I getting them to the right person? Yeah, and I think that's one of the Yeah, and I think that's one of the Yeah, and I think that's one of the challenges of kind of how do I create challenges of kind of how do I create challenges of kind of how do I create this picture that takes into account all this picture that takes into account all this picture that takes into account all of the context that I have from of the context that I have from of the context that I have from different tools from a different different tools from a different different tools from a different environments and um I think that that's environments and um I think that that's environments and um I think that that's definitely one of the things that adds definitely one of the things that adds definitely one of the things that adds um challenge to the to the entire um challenge to the to the entire um challenge to the to the entire process. Kell from your perspective process. Kell from your perspective process. Kell from your perspective about kind of how we scan. Yeah. Um my about kind of how we scan. Yeah. Um my about kind of how we scan. Yeah. Um my my biggest thing was I always wanted my biggest thing was I always wanted my biggest thing was I always wanted that one scanner to rule them all. that one scanner to rule them all. that one scanner to rule them all. always uh because we are using a always uh because we are using a always uh because we are using a multitude of scanners because I mean we multitude of scanners because I mean we multitude of scanners because I mean we don't have one tool to rule them all and don't have one tool to rule them all and don't have one tool to rule them all and maybe that's never going to happen. Um maybe that's never going to happen. Um maybe that's never going to happen. Um but it's all I ever wished for because but it's all I ever wished for because but it's all I ever wished for because you're speaking different languages you're speaking different languages you're speaking different languages between different scanners. They're between different scanners. They're between different scanners. They're working in different environments and working in different environments and working in different environments and then um as we've kind of talked about then um as we've kind of talked about then um as we've kind of talked about each of those each of those unique each of those each of those unique each of those each of those unique vulnerabilities then need to be turned vulnerabilities then need to be turned vulnerabilities then need to be turned into one language and sent to the right into one language and sent to the right into one language and sent to the right owner. owner. owner. And so not only are the tools speaking And so not only are the tools speaking And so not only are the tools speaking different languages, but these different languages, but these different languages, but these vulnerabilities are being identified at vulnerabilities are being identified at vulnerabilities are being identified at different different sections and stages different different sections and stages different different sections and stages of the STLC, which means they're going of the STLC, which means they're going of the STLC, which means they're going to different people who who all to different people who who all to different people who who all understand these things differently. So understand these things differently. So understand these things differently. So for me I would have always loved to have for me I would have always loved to have for me I would have always loved to have that but in in place of that we had to that but in in place of that we had to that but in in place of that we had to build our own aggregation capabilities build our own aggregation capabilities build our own aggregation capabilities to take all of these scanners to take to take all of these scanners to take to take all of these scanners to take all the unique vulnerabilities to take all the unique vulnerabilities to take all the unique vulnerabilities to take the CVE data and to mesh that with our the CVE data and to mesh that with our the CVE data and to mesh that with our assets um so that we knew who to go to assets um so that we knew who to go to assets um so that we knew who to go to um and make sure that we were getting um and make sure that we were getting um and make sure that we were getting the vulnerability data to them through a the vulnerability data to them through a the vulnerability data to them through a yet another tool in a way that they yet another tool in a way that they yet another tool in a way that they would understand. Okay. and and again would understand. Okay. and and again would understand. Okay. and and again tapping into that um okay we have tapping into that um okay we have tapping into that um okay we have vulnerabilities we've communicate them vulnerabilities we've communicate them vulnerabilities we've communicate them we we've communicated them uh we kind of we we've communicated them uh we kind of we we've communicated them uh we kind of bridge that gap um what about the next bridge that gap um what about the next bridge that gap um what about the next phase how do we fix um what's kind of phase how do we fix um what's kind of phase how do we fix um what's kind of your perspective into the remediation your perspective into the remediation your perspective into the remediation aspect so one of the key things for for aspect so one of the key things for for aspect so one of the key things for for my life was that I I was never the my life was that I I was never the my life was that I I was never the remediator I was never the fixer I found remediator I was never the fixer I found remediator I was never the fixer I found the problems s via tools. I communicated the problems s via tools. I communicated the problems s via tools. I communicated those issues to the individuals who those issues to the individuals who those issues to the individuals who needed to do the fixing, but I was never needed to do the fixing, but I was never needed to do the fixing, but I was never the fixer. So that was definitely a the fixer. So that was definitely a the fixer. So that was definitely a challenge when as I as I my disclaimer challenge when as I as I my disclaimer challenge when as I as I my disclaimer in the beginning, I'm not a developer. in the beginning, I'm not a developer. in the beginning, I'm not a developer. I'm not a software engineer. And so I'm not a software engineer. And so I'm not a software engineer. And so helping these teams remediate was was helping these teams remediate was was helping these teams remediate was was challenging. Um because if if I wasn't challenging. Um because if if I wasn't challenging. Um because if if I wasn't even set up for success, how could I even set up for success, how could I even set up for success, how could I expect them to be set up for success in expect them to be set up for success in expect them to be set up for success in actually fixing these things? So there actually fixing these things? So there actually fixing these things? So there was a lot of uh of of teamwork, let's was a lot of uh of of teamwork, let's was a lot of uh of of teamwork, let's say, going back to that relationship I say, going back to that relationship I say, going back to that relationship I was able to build with these teams where was able to build with these teams where was able to build with these teams where they would come to me and they'd be they would come to me and they'd be they would come to me and they'd be like, I I don't know what you want me to like, I I don't know what you want me to like, I I don't know what you want me to do with this. You just gave me this do with this. You just gave me this do with this. You just gave me this vulnerability. What the heck am I vulnerability. What the heck am I vulnerability. What the heck am I supposed to do with this thing? And it supposed to do with this thing? And it supposed to do with this thing? And it was a team effort. We would all join was a team effort. We would all join was a team effort. We would all join hands and figure out how to remediate hands and figure out how to remediate hands and figure out how to remediate this thing. Um because it wasn't it was this thing. Um because it wasn't it was this thing. Um because it wasn't it was not something that all of us just had not something that all of us just had not something that all of us just had this innate experience to be able to do. this innate experience to be able to do. this innate experience to be able to do. So, um, building the relationship was So, um, building the relationship was So, um, building the relationship was key so that they would trust me to know key so that they would trust me to know key so that they would trust me to know that they could tell me and then we'd be that they could tell me and then we'd be that they could tell me and then we'd be able to, uh, collectively work on able to, uh, collectively work on able to, uh, collectively work on getting stuff fixed. Well, I think the getting stuff fixed. Well, I think the getting stuff fixed. Well, I think the remediation program can be a lot of remediation program can be a lot of remediation program can be a lot of different companies really under different companies really under different companies really under prioritize remediation guidance as part prioritize remediation guidance as part prioritize remediation guidance as part of how they prioritize vulnerability of how they prioritize vulnerability of how they prioritize vulnerability remediation overall. Um because the remediation overall. Um because the remediation overall. Um because the danger is when you're not like so many danger is when you're not like so many danger is when you're not like so many vulnerability tools still work on like a vulnerability tools still work on like a vulnerability tools still work on like a CVE by CVE basis where I always pushed CVE by CVE basis where I always pushed CVE by CVE basis where I always pushed instead to think in terms of like either instead to think in terms of like either instead to think in terms of like either container image layers or package layers container image layers or package layers container image layers or package layers um because if I send out uh a common um because if I send out uh a common um because if I send out uh a common Java frameworks like Spring framework Java frameworks like Spring framework Java frameworks like Spring framework and if one CVE shows up and I send that and if one CVE shows up and I send that and if one CVE shows up and I send that to 30 different teams that use that to 30 different teams that use that to 30 different teams that use that framework and they're all going to try framework and they're all going to try framework and they're all going to try to run their own little mini upgrades to to run their own little mini upgrades to to run their own little mini upgrades to try to fix it like I've just wasted a try to fix it like I've just wasted a try to fix it like I've just wasted a ton of business time when in reality one ton of business time when in reality one ton of business time when in reality one developer should have planned a spring developer should have planned a spring developer should have planned a spring migration for the organization and then migration for the organization and then migration for the organization and then actually implemented that across all of actually implemented that across all of actually implemented that across all of the teams and I just think that this the teams and I just think that this the teams and I just think that this remediation piece has been so remediation piece has been so remediation piece has been so underexplored because at the end of the underexplored because at the end of the underexplored because at the end of the day a developer is not the one buying a day a developer is not the one buying a day a developer is not the one buying a security tool and so that's what makes security tool and so that's what makes security tool and so that's what makes it uh so that vendors are prioritizing it uh so that vendors are prioritizing it uh so that vendors are prioritizing the vulnerability prioritization piece the vulnerability prioritization piece the vulnerability prioritization piece but more fundamental to that the reason but more fundamental to that the reason but more fundamental to that the reason our VA programs I think get the number our VA programs I think get the number our VA programs I think get the number only seems to go up is because only seems to go up is because only seems to go up is because remediation is really hard um or else remediation is really hard um or else remediation is really hard um or else the number would go down because we're the number would go down because we're the number would go down because we're just patching things as services get just patching things as services get just patching things as services get redeployed. And so I think that uh redeployed. And so I think that uh redeployed. And so I think that uh hopefully more and more tools will start hopefully more and more tools will start hopefully more and more tools will start grouping things that way. But I think grouping things that way. But I think grouping things that way. But I think that's the the main thing I look at is that's the the main thing I look at is that's the the main thing I look at is the bare minimum. might need to be the bare minimum. might need to be the bare minimum. might need to be grouping these things by package names grouping these things by package names grouping these things by package names and not individual CVEes because that's and not individual CVEes because that's and not individual CVEes because that's the that's security people think in the that's security people think in the that's security people think in terms of specific CVEes especially on terms of specific CVEes especially on terms of specific CVEes especially on the compliance side around what's the the compliance side around what's the the compliance side around what's the risk of this CVE what's the CVSS score risk of this CVE what's the CVSS score risk of this CVE what's the CVSS score what's the EPSS what's the KEV how do I what's the EPSS what's the KEV how do I what's the EPSS what's the KEV how do I prioritize it but a developer thinks in prioritize it but a developer thinks in prioritize it but a developer thinks in terms of what package is this and how terms of what package is this and how terms of what package is this and how hard is it going to be to upgrade this hard is it going to be to upgrade this hard is it going to be to upgrade this package and do we have a way to deploy package and do we have a way to deploy package and do we have a way to deploy this uh at scale this uh at scale this uh at scale um when I hear CVE and fixes is I think um when I hear CVE and fixes is I think um when I hear CVE and fixes is I think I it's maybe a bit of a another I it's maybe a bit of a another I it's maybe a bit of a another challenge that I'm facing. Um but um we challenge that I'm facing. Um but um we challenge that I'm facing. Um but um we got that uh disclosure in an open source got that uh disclosure in an open source got that uh disclosure in an open source package lately. Um and it was an package lately. Um and it was an package lately. Um and it was an improper sanitization of the of the user improper sanitization of the of the user improper sanitization of the of the user input. Uh and we were discussing it with input. Uh and we were discussing it with input. Uh and we were discussing it with the maintainer. We wanted them to fix it the maintainer. We wanted them to fix it the maintainer. We wanted them to fix it before we make public uh disclosure. Um before we make public uh disclosure. Um before we make public uh disclosure. Um it's public so I'm not disclosing it's public so I'm not disclosing it's public so I'm not disclosing anything. anything. anything. Um but uh but when we discussed it with Um but uh but when we discussed it with Um but uh but when we discussed it with the maintainer um he was saying that uh the maintainer um he was saying that uh the maintainer um he was saying that uh he thinks that uh it's not what for what he thinks that uh it's not what for what he thinks that uh it's not what for what the package was built and that it's not the package was built and that it's not the package was built and that it's not his responsibility to fix it but rather his responsibility to fix it but rather his responsibility to fix it but rather the responsibility of the developers to the responsibility of the developers to the responsibility of the developers to make sure that their user input uh in make sure that their user input uh in make sure that their user input uh in their applications are sanitized. Um, their applications are sanitized. Um, their applications are sanitized. Um, and it's at that point that I I felt and it's at that point that I I felt and it's at that point that I I felt like I'm in the middle of a negotiation like I'm in the middle of a negotiation like I'm in the middle of a negotiation between the researchers and the between the researchers and the between the researchers and the reporters that disclose the reporters that disclose the reporters that disclose the vulnerability and the maintainers and vulnerability and the maintainers and vulnerability and the maintainers and the developers that are using that the developers that are using that the developers that are using that package and who's responsible of what package and who's responsible of what package and who's responsible of what and who should make sure that this uh and who should make sure that this uh and who should make sure that this uh user input is sanitized. Um, and I think user input is sanitized. Um, and I think user input is sanitized. Um, and I think that it goes like when we're talking in that it goes like when we're talking in that it goes like when we're talking in that sense about CVE and fixes, it goes that sense about CVE and fixes, it goes that sense about CVE and fixes, it goes behind the vulnerability management behind the vulnerability management behind the vulnerability management process. I think that it's more about um process. I think that it's more about um process. I think that it's more about um like ownership and uh expectations about like ownership and uh expectations about like ownership and uh expectations about who's responsible of what. Um and I who's responsible of what. Um and I who's responsible of what. Um and I think that if we could dis talk about think that if we could dis talk about think that if we could dis talk about those topics more uh and define um uh those topics more uh and define um uh those topics more uh and define um uh maybe in a better way uh what are those maybe in a better way uh what are those maybe in a better way uh what are those expectations um across the ecosystems expectations um across the ecosystems expectations um across the ecosystems the the vulnerability management could the the vulnerability management could the the vulnerability management could be uh better or the the communication uh be uh better or the the communication uh be uh better or the the communication uh between all of the stakeholders uh could between all of the stakeholders uh could between all of the stakeholders uh could be better. So I uh I I will say that we be better. So I uh I I will say that we be better. So I uh I I will say that we kind of debated whether also to kind of debated whether also to kind of debated whether also to represent kind of this tension between represent kind of this tension between represent kind of this tension between the researchers and the uh the the researchers and the uh the the researchers and the uh the maintainers and I think that's that maintainers and I think that's that maintainers and I think that's that could be a different panel on its own. could be a different panel on its own. could be a different panel on its own. So, I won't uh dive into that. Just uh So, I won't uh dive into that. Just uh So, I won't uh dive into that. Just uh an anecdote um about what you said about an anecdote um about what you said about an anecdote um about what you said about um um I remember there I don't know if um um I remember there I don't know if um um I remember there I don't know if you remember like a couple years back you remember like a couple years back you remember like a couple years back there was a vulnerability in uh uh XZ I there was a vulnerability in uh uh XZ I there was a vulnerability in uh uh XZ I think um that was around in Python or a think um that was around in Python or a think um that was around in Python or a zipping yeah in Python zip that has been zipping yeah in Python zip that has been zipping yeah in Python zip that has been in existence for 15 years and I was like in existence for 15 years and I was like in existence for 15 years and I was like uh so two things actually came to mind. uh so two things actually came to mind. uh so two things actually came to mind. how how that came to be. So the reason how how that came to be. So the reason how how that came to be. So the reason was that 15 years ago when the was that 15 years ago when the was that 15 years ago when the vulnerability was reported uh and the vulnerability was reported uh and the vulnerability was reported uh and the CVE was issued the maintainer said CVE was issued the maintainer said CVE was issued the maintainer said that's not my problem. You just have to that's not my problem. You just have to that's not my problem. You just have to sanitize your input and you'll be fine. sanitize your input and you'll be fine. sanitize your input and you'll be fine. And way back in 2007 that was okay and And way back in 2007 that was okay and And way back in 2007 that was okay and that's how it ended. So the volunt the that's how it ended. So the volunt the that's how it ended. So the volunt the vulnerability would stayed in the code vulnerability would stayed in the code vulnerability would stayed in the code basically for 15 years. Um, and then basically for 15 years. Um, and then basically for 15 years. Um, and then what came to mind as a researcher then, what came to mind as a researcher then, what came to mind as a researcher then, okay, so how come I'm not seeing that in okay, so how come I'm not seeing that in okay, so how come I'm not seeing that in every scan that I do on the scanner and every scan that I do on the scanner and every scan that I do on the scanner and then I found out that the CPE that was then I found out that the CPE that was then I found out that the CPE that was used uh 15 years ago was in a different used uh 15 years ago was in a different used uh 15 years ago was in a different format that most scanners simply don't format that most scanners simply don't format that most scanners simply don't support and that's why the the only support and that's why the the only support and that's why the the only reason that it isn't surfacing because reason that it isn't surfacing because reason that it isn't surfacing because the vulnerability is there and it's it's the vulnerability is there and it's it's the vulnerability is there and it's it's strictly um mentioned that it wasn't strictly um mentioned that it wasn't strictly um mentioned that it wasn't never fixed. So yeah just an anecdote it never fixed. So yeah just an anecdote it never fixed. So yeah just an anecdote it it ties back to several points in the it ties back to several points in the it ties back to several points in the discussion. discussion. discussion. Um okay so given that would you say a Um okay so given that would you say a Um okay so given that would you say a that the vulnerabilities are actually a that the vulnerabilities are actually a that the vulnerabilities are actually a reflection of risk like the number of reflection of risk like the number of reflection of risk like the number of vulnerabilities is the the amount of vulnerabilities is the the amount of vulnerabilities is the the amount of risk you have. Um, so I think that when risk you have. Um, so I think that when risk you have. Um, so I think that when we're talking about risk, um, I would we're talking about risk, um, I would we're talking about risk, um, I would start talking about the CVSS, which I start talking about the CVSS, which I start talking about the CVSS, which I think is a great framework because it's think is a great framework because it's think is a great framework because it's like a common language and a baseline like a common language and a baseline like a common language and a baseline between all of the stakeholders where between all of the stakeholders where between all of the stakeholders where all know what we're talking about when all know what we're talking about when all know what we're talking about when we talk about the severity of a we talk about the severity of a we talk about the severity of a vulnerability. Um, but I think that in vulnerability. Um, but I think that in vulnerability. Um, but I think that in the contextdriven era that we are living the contextdriven era that we are living the contextdriven era that we are living in, um, it's maybe not enough. Um and in, um, it's maybe not enough. Um and in, um, it's maybe not enough. Um and here comes the EPSS uh which is showing here comes the EPSS uh which is showing here comes the EPSS uh which is showing us about the likelihood of explo of uh us about the likelihood of explo of uh us about the likelihood of explo of uh exploitation of the vulnerability. Uh exploitation of the vulnerability. Uh exploitation of the vulnerability. Uh and when we're looking at the EPSS and when we're looking at the EPSS and when we're looking at the EPSS distribution, we see that um most of the distribution, we see that um most of the distribution, we see that um most of the vulnerability won't probably be vulnerability won't probably be vulnerability won't probably be exploited uh in the wild. Um, and I exploited uh in the wild. Um, and I exploited uh in the wild. Um, and I think that that's very interesting think that that's very interesting think that that's very interesting because it shows us like when we're because it shows us like when we're because it shows us like when we're talking about risk, we're talking about talking about risk, we're talking about talking about risk, we're talking about impact and likelihood uh and uh and impact and likelihood uh and uh and impact and likelihood uh and uh and there is some impact and exploitation uh there is some impact and exploitation uh there is some impact and exploitation uh in the CVSs, but it's more related to in the CVSs, but it's more related to in the CVSs, but it's more related to the the spec the specifications of the the the spec the specifications of the the the spec the specifications of the vulnerability. Um, and the EPSS is vulnerability. Um, and the EPSS is vulnerability. Um, and the EPSS is adding something about the likelihood of adding something about the likelihood of adding something about the likelihood of exploitation. uh but I think that when exploitation. uh but I think that when exploitation. uh but I think that when we're talking about risk we're talking we're talking about risk we're talking we're talking about risk we're talking also about uh the context it can be the also about uh the context it can be the also about uh the context it can be the business impact um of the if the business impact um of the if the business impact um of the if the vulnerability is being exploited in the vulnerability is being exploited in the vulnerability is being exploited in the context of the company or the context of the company or the context of the company or the organization organization organization um and it can be also the likelihood of um and it can be also the likelihood of um and it can be also the likelihood of exploitation. So yeah, we're talking exploitation. So yeah, we're talking exploitation. So yeah, we're talking about reachability. Uh we are talking about reachability. Uh we are talking about reachability. Uh we are talking about um like maybe also if it's about um like maybe also if it's about um like maybe also if it's transitive vulnerability or not, if it's transitive vulnerability or not, if it's transitive vulnerability or not, if it's in a dev dependency and then we will in a dev dependency and then we will in a dev dependency and then we will probably just ignore the vulnerability. probably just ignore the vulnerability. probably just ignore the vulnerability. Um I think that um we should move from Um I think that um we should move from Um I think that um we should move from vulnerability reduction to risk vulnerability reduction to risk vulnerability reduction to risk reduction because risk reduction is more reduction because risk reduction is more reduction because risk reduction is more about reducing the vulnerability that about reducing the vulnerability that about reducing the vulnerability that truly matters in the context of our truly matters in the context of our truly matters in the context of our applications. applications. applications. James. Uh, yeah. I think vulnerability James. Uh, yeah. I think vulnerability James. Uh, yeah. I think vulnerability management is in a weird place when it management is in a weird place when it management is in a weird place when it comes to risk and what we're actually comes to risk and what we're actually comes to risk and what we're actually doing. Um, because I think there are doing. Um, because I think there are doing. Um, because I think there are ways to run a vulnerab a vulnerability ways to run a vulnerab a vulnerability ways to run a vulnerab a vulnerability management tool and have it tell you management tool and have it tell you management tool and have it tell you something close to risk. Um, but something close to risk. Um, but something close to risk. Um, but unfortunately I don't think it's tied to unfortunately I don't think it's tied to unfortunately I don't think it's tied to a lot of the metrics that we're using a lot of the metrics that we're using a lot of the metrics that we're using where it's more subjective things like where it's more subjective things like where it's more subjective things like is this a hot vulnerability right now? is this a hot vulnerability right now? is this a hot vulnerability right now? like log forj was easy enough to send like log forj was easy enough to send like log forj was easy enough to send the payloads that a lot of people were the payloads that a lot of people were the payloads that a lot of people were doing it and so yeah that was a bad one doing it and so yeah that was a bad one doing it and so yeah that was a bad one but I don't know how much the different but I don't know how much the different but I don't know how much the different scoring mechanisms prioritization things scoring mechanisms prioritization things scoring mechanisms prioritization things it's always hard to tell how that's it's always hard to tell how that's it's always hard to tell how that's going to fit into your software and so I going to fit into your software and so I going to fit into your software and so I think there's nothing honestly that think there's nothing honestly that think there's nothing honestly that replaces having just an actual view and replaces having just an actual view and replaces having just an actual view and understanding of how your software is understanding of how your software is understanding of how your software is made which is why uh my normal advice made which is why uh my normal advice made which is why uh my normal advice for people at stuff is like learn for people at stuff is like learn for people at stuff is like learn Kubernetes because unfortunately it's Kubernetes because unfortunately it's Kubernetes because unfortunately it's really hard to learn how your really hard to learn how your really hard to learn how your application works if you don't know how application works if you don't know how application works if you don't know how the underlying infrastructure happens the underlying infrastructure happens the underlying infrastructure happens Um, and I think that's what creates the Um, and I think that's what creates the Um, and I think that's what creates the risk is if we use CBES as sort of a risk is if we use CBES as sort of a risk is if we use CBES as sort of a crutch for an actual understanding of crutch for an actual understanding of crutch for an actual understanding of what's happening in our software what's happening in our software what's happening in our software deployment processes and our businesses. deployment processes and our businesses. deployment processes and our businesses. Um, and the other side is maybe it's Um, and the other side is maybe it's Um, and the other side is maybe it's because I came through an MDR provider because I came through an MDR provider because I came through an MDR provider and I have such a runtime view of and I have such a runtime view of and I have such a runtime view of things. Um, but I think the other side things. Um, but I think the other side things. Um, but I think the other side of management is we've separated it from of management is we've separated it from of management is we've separated it from a traditional view of security in like a traditional view of security in like a traditional view of security in like an operations context is having an onion an operations context is having an onion an operations context is having an onion approach, right? Where uh I've got crowd approach, right? Where uh I've got crowd approach, right? Where uh I've got crowd strike on the box. Gosh, I can't believe strike on the box. Gosh, I can't believe strike on the box. Gosh, I can't believe I said crush right. We have some kind of I said crush right. We have some kind of I said crush right. We have some kind of endpoint protection on the box. We've endpoint protection on the box. We've endpoint protection on the box. We've got some kind of uh supply chain got some kind of uh supply chain got some kind of uh supply chain solution on the box. We've got firewalls solution on the box. We've got firewalls solution on the box. We've got firewalls in place. The move to cloud sort of in place. The move to cloud sort of in place. The move to cloud sort of abstracted away a lot of what vendors abstracted away a lot of what vendors abstracted away a lot of what vendors were using for what at runtime were using for what at runtime were using for what at runtime protection. But like at the end of the protection. But like at the end of the protection. But like at the end of the day, that was the mitigation. That was day, that was the mitigation. That was day, that was the mitigation. That was the last line of defense. So that I the last line of defense. So that I the last line of defense. So that I don't think anyone's being kept awake don't think anyone's being kept awake don't think anyone's being kept awake too much by uh like the latest Adobe too much by uh like the latest Adobe too much by uh like the latest Adobe vulnerability on their employees laptop, vulnerability on their employees laptop, vulnerability on their employees laptop, right? like we're not worried about a right? like we're not worried about a right? like we're not worried about a massive uh software infrastructure massive uh software infrastructure massive uh software infrastructure breach um from like a CVE on an Adobe breach um from like a CVE on an Adobe breach um from like a CVE on an Adobe application. Um and it but we we are application. Um and it but we we are application. Um and it but we we are worried about that when it comes to our worried about that when it comes to our worried about that when it comes to our running software because we lack a lot running software because we lack a lot running software because we lack a lot of those runtime mitigations that are in of those runtime mitigations that are in of those runtime mitigations that are in place uh the way they are for different place uh the way they are for different place uh the way they are for different corporate devices and things like that. corporate devices and things like that. corporate devices and things like that. And so to me uh all that to say I think And so to me uh all that to say I think And so to me uh all that to say I think that our view of risk needs to expand uh that our view of risk needs to expand uh that our view of risk needs to expand uh both beyond CVEEs to just actually both beyond CVEEs to just actually both beyond CVEEs to just actually understanding what's there but also a understanding what's there but also a understanding what's there but also a lot of the runtime mitigation stuff um lot of the runtime mitigation stuff um lot of the runtime mitigation stuff um that's actually there and uh the that's actually there and uh the that's actually there and uh the evolution of cloud runtime stuff which I evolution of cloud runtime stuff which I evolution of cloud runtime stuff which I love to talk about. So yeah. So, um, my love to talk about. So yeah. So, um, my love to talk about. So yeah. So, um, my quick thoughts for this one, um, quick thoughts for this one, um, quick thoughts for this one, um, oftentimes scanning would just uncover oftentimes scanning would just uncover oftentimes scanning would just uncover poor build choices, poor configuration poor build choices, poor configuration poor build choices, poor configuration choices, poor software management choices, poor software management choices, poor software management choices. Like, you know, do we have to choices. Like, you know, do we have to choices. Like, you know, do we have to have like 10 versions of old Java have like 10 versions of old Java have like 10 versions of old Java hanging out in case we need to roll hanging out in case we need to roll hanging out in case we need to roll back? Like, how far are you going to back? Like, how far are you going to back? Like, how far are you going to roll back? Why do we have to hold on to roll back? Why do we have to hold on to roll back? Why do we have to hold on to all of those yet? Those are all of those yet? Those are all of those yet? Those are vulnerabilities. Each one counts as a vulnerabilities. Each one counts as a vulnerabilities. Each one counts as a mark against you if you have old mark against you if you have old mark against you if you have old software hanging out. And um is it a software hanging out. And um is it a software hanging out. And um is it a risk? Like I don't know. It's certainly risk? Like I don't know. It's certainly risk? Like I don't know. It's certainly a vulnerability. It certainly was a vulnerability. It certainly was a vulnerability. It certainly was identified by my scanner and it's going identified by my scanner and it's going identified by my scanner and it's going to go on the report. Um but does that to go on the report. Um but does that to go on the report. Um but does that mean it's an actual risk for the mean it's an actual risk for the mean it's an actual risk for the organization? That is certainly a organization? That is certainly a organization? That is certainly a conversation organizations need to have conversation organizations need to have conversation organizations need to have and they need to make that decision. Um and they need to make that decision. Um and they need to make that decision. Um and then the last thing I think here is and then the last thing I think here is and then the last thing I think here is that we have to really be careful with that we have to really be careful with that we have to really be careful with vulnerability management not to over vulnerability management not to over vulnerability management not to over rotate on the reporting. Like like I rotate on the reporting. Like like I rotate on the reporting. Like like I said, vulnerabilities become a number. said, vulnerabilities become a number. said, vulnerabilities become a number. all of a sudden you have a h 100,000, all of a sudden you have a h 100,000, all of a sudden you have a h 100,000, you know, your bar graph is up here. You you know, your bar graph is up here. You you know, your bar graph is up here. You know, which business unit gets a gold know, which business unit gets a gold know, which business unit gets a gold star for for knocking down more numbers. star for for knocking down more numbers. star for for knocking down more numbers. And we start to focus on how many of And we start to focus on how many of And we start to focus on how many of these we have and you can't get past these we have and you can't get past these we have and you can't get past that. And it becomes a a cultural issue that. And it becomes a a cultural issue that. And it becomes a a cultural issue if you over rotate on reporting. Like if you over rotate on reporting. Like if you over rotate on reporting. Like that's what goes up to the executives is that's what goes up to the executives is that's what goes up to the executives is how many vulnerabilities you've knocked how many vulnerabilities you've knocked how many vulnerabilities you've knocked down. nothing about the maybe the real down. nothing about the maybe the real down. nothing about the maybe the real risk. So that's definitely comes back to risk. So that's definitely comes back to risk. So that's definitely comes back to how you measure um uh and what are you how you measure um uh and what are you how you measure um uh and what are you measured on. So real quick because we're measured on. So real quick because we're measured on. So real quick because we're we're kind of getting short on time. we're kind of getting short on time. we're kind of getting short on time. Maybe kind of um what do you love and Maybe kind of um what do you love and Maybe kind of um what do you love and hate about security tools? Try to make hate about security tools? Try to make hate about security tools? Try to make it short. James, I think you we will be it short. James, I think you we will be it short. James, I think you we will be concise, but yeah. Um I I hate how many concise, but yeah. Um I I hate how many concise, but yeah. Um I I hate how many we have. I hate they're hard to set up. we have. I hate they're hard to set up. we have. I hate they're hard to set up. Uh configure, customize, manage. Um, and Uh configure, customize, manage. Um, and Uh configure, customize, manage. Um, and then and and then and the actual risk then and and then and the actual risk then and and then and the actual risk reduction is almost next to impossible reduction is almost next to impossible reduction is almost next to impossible for them because it's all about for them because it's all about for them because it's all about identifying. Um, and then but I love identifying. Um, and then but I love identifying. Um, and then but I love that like when you get the right tool that like when you get the right tool that like when you get the right tool for the job, it's magic. And when you for the job, it's magic. And when you for the job, it's magic. And when you find the right vendor who's willing to find the right vendor who's willing to find the right vendor who's willing to partner with you to actually create partner with you to actually create partner with you to actually create something successful, that's the best. something successful, that's the best. something successful, that's the best. James, yeah, I think it's a lovehate James, yeah, I think it's a lovehate James, yeah, I think it's a lovehate thing where a lot of vendor products are thing where a lot of vendor products are thing where a lot of vendor products are super annoying. Um, but the thing I say super annoying. Um, but the thing I say super annoying. Um, but the thing I say it's because we're kind of annoying when it's because we're kind of annoying when it's because we're kind of annoying when we tell them what we want. And uh, I we tell them what we want. And uh, I we tell them what we want. And uh, I just think about how many vendor choices just think about how many vendor choices just think about how many vendor choices I've made where I was evaluating based I've made where I was evaluating based I've made where I was evaluating based on number of detections and then I turn on number of detections and then I turn on number of detections and then I turn around and I'm surprised that like around and I'm surprised that like around and I'm surprised that like vendors have a ton of false positives vendors have a ton of false positives vendors have a ton of false positives with a huge amount of numbers. It's with a huge amount of numbers. It's with a huge amount of numbers. It's because I asked for it. Like I wanted to because I asked for it. Like I wanted to because I asked for it. Like I wanted to see the huge numbers of stuff. I just see the huge numbers of stuff. I just see the huge numbers of stuff. I just don't want to see it anymore now that I don't want to see it anymore now that I don't want to see it anymore now that I bought your thing. And so that's all bought your thing. And so that's all bought your thing. And so that's all that to say. That's me saying I don't that to say. That's me saying I don't that to say. That's me saying I don't like most vendor products, but I also like most vendor products, but I also like most vendor products, but I also think it's a little bit our fault. think it's a little bit our fault. think it's a little bit our fault. Okay, so kind of to end things on kind Okay, so kind of to end things on kind Okay, so kind of to end things on kind of a uh kind of of a uh kind of of a uh kind of forward-looking uh kumbaya forward-looking uh kumbaya forward-looking uh kumbaya um uh collaborative spirit. Um, if each um uh collaborative spirit. Um, if each um uh collaborative spirit. Um, if each one of you had one tip, uh, one one of you had one tip, uh, one one of you had one tip, uh, one recommendation, one advice recommendation, one advice recommendation, one advice for one of the stakeholders in the for one of the stakeholders in the for one of the stakeholders in the process, what would that be? Mine would process, what would that be? Mine would process, what would that be? Mine would go to system owners, application owners go to system owners, application owners go to system owners, application owners out there. Um, asset inventory and out there. Um, asset inventory and out there. Um, asset inventory and management is the beginning of all of management is the beginning of all of management is the beginning of all of this. If you cannot document the things this. If you cannot document the things this. If you cannot document the things you're building and how you're building you're building and how you're building you're building and how you're building them and what that actually means to the them and what that actually means to the them and what that actually means to the organization, so the data you're organization, so the data you're organization, so the data you're processing, how critical is this thing? processing, how critical is this thing? processing, how critical is this thing? If you're not doing that, then it If you're not doing that, then it If you're not doing that, then it doesn't matter what the rest of the doesn't matter what the rest of the doesn't matter what the rest of the chain does because you don't understand chain does because you don't understand chain does because you don't understand the business context. Um, so that would the business context. Um, so that would the business context. Um, so that would be my one ask is if you build something, be my one ask is if you build something, be my one ask is if you build something, document the crap out of it. Um my one ask uh would be to the Um my one ask uh would be to the Um my one ask uh would be to the security teams uh to continue focus uh security teams uh to continue focus uh security teams uh to continue focus uh on the developers and to continue focus on the developers and to continue focus on the developers and to continue focus on the vulnerabilities that matters the on the vulnerabilities that matters the on the vulnerabilities that matters the most in the context of the project or most in the context of the project or most in the context of the project or the application where they exist. Uh I the application where they exist. Uh I the application where they exist. Uh I think that if we focus on that and we think that if we focus on that and we think that if we focus on that and we provide uh um like the the provide uh um like the the provide uh um like the the vulnerabilities that matters the most to vulnerabilities that matters the most to vulnerabilities that matters the most to the developers and they don't just get the developers and they don't just get the developers and they don't just get vulnerabilities every day and and and vulnerabilities every day and and and vulnerabilities every day and and and they feel like it's a waste of time. Um they feel like it's a waste of time. Um they feel like it's a waste of time. Um it will be noise reduction and it will it will be noise reduction and it will it will be noise reduction and it will also make uh the vulnerability also make uh the vulnerability also make uh the vulnerability management process more scalable uh and management process more scalable uh and management process more scalable uh and effective. effective. effective. Yep. I mean I already gave mine away. I Yep. I mean I already gave mine away. I Yep. I mean I already gave mine away. I always say learn Kubernetes because it's always say learn Kubernetes because it's always say learn Kubernetes because it's hard to how do you even know you have an hard to how do you even know you have an hard to how do you even know you have an asset inventory like if you're trying to asset inventory like if you're trying to asset inventory like if you're trying to do that for a modern cloudnative do that for a modern cloudnative do that for a modern cloudnative architecture and like it it requires architecture and like it it requires architecture and like it it requires understanding um how some of it works understanding um how some of it works understanding um how some of it works but since I already said that one I'll but since I already said that one I'll but since I already said that one I'll sneak in a second um and say to if sneak in a second um and say to if sneak in a second um and say to if something doesn't make sense to you it's something doesn't make sense to you it's something doesn't make sense to you it's probably the tools fault and not your probably the tools fault and not your probably the tools fault and not your fault. I really was kicking myself using fault. I really was kicking myself using fault. I really was kicking myself using so many different tools for so long when so many different tools for so long when so many different tools for so long when I was learning application security I was learning application security I was learning application security thinking like am I just stupid like I thinking like am I just stupid like I thinking like am I just stupid like I don't understand like how this is a don't understand like how this is a don't understand like how this is a cross-ite scripting or like SSRF or cross-ite scripting or like SSRF or cross-ite scripting or like SSRF or whatever and the answer is like it's a whatever and the answer is like it's a whatever and the answer is like it's a bad description that's not applicable to bad description that's not applicable to bad description that's not applicable to my environment and it doesn't make sense my environment and it doesn't make sense my environment and it doesn't make sense and if there's a reason that every one and if there's a reason that every one and if there's a reason that every one of these basic questions you have to of these basic questions you have to of these basic questions you have to talk to like the chief architect of the talk to like the chief architect of the talk to like the chief architect of the company to figure out are we vulnerable company to figure out are we vulnerable company to figure out are we vulnerable to an SSRF because it's like a really to an SSRF because it's like a really to an SSRF because it's like a really complicated question that involves the complicated question that involves the complicated question that involves the whole architecture of your application. whole architecture of your application. whole architecture of your application. and not just like this exists or and not just like this exists or and not just like this exists or something. So, uh yeah, cool. Thank you something. So, uh yeah, cool. Thank you something. So, uh yeah, cool. Thank you and thanks everyone the panelist. I and thanks everyone the panelist. I and thanks everyone the panelist. I think we have a couple minutes left for think we have a couple minutes left for think we have a couple minutes left for maybe a question or two. Anyone wants We maybe a question or two. Anyone wants We maybe a question or two. Anyone wants We do have a couple of questions on the do have a couple of questions on the do have a couple of questions on the discord channel. So, um I'll start with discord channel. So, um I'll start with discord channel. So, um I'll start with one of them as people conglomerate here. one of them as people conglomerate here. one of them as people conglomerate here. So uh sometimes development teams become So uh sometimes development teams become So uh sometimes development teams become too reliant on security teams in too reliant on security teams in too reliant on security teams in identifying vulnerabilities that don't identifying vulnerabilities that don't identifying vulnerabilities that don't self-report or take initiatives to self-report or take initiatives to self-report or take initiatives to preemptively fix security bugs if the preemptively fix security bugs if the preemptively fix security bugs if the scanners don't identify those issues. scanners don't identify those issues. scanners don't identify those issues. How do we empower development teams to How do we empower development teams to How do we empower development teams to feel ownership not only in fixing but feel ownership not only in fixing but feel ownership not only in fixing but also identifying security bugs? Give also identifying security bugs? Give also identifying security bugs? Give them an ID plugin. I'm joking. That's a them an ID plugin. I'm joking. That's a them an ID plugin. I'm joking. That's a joke. Uh the the real answer is that joke. Uh the the real answer is that joke. Uh the the real answer is that they have to feel like security is a they have to feel like security is a they have to feel like security is a safe space conversation to have with safe space conversation to have with safe space conversation to have with them. That just because they report them. That just because they report them. That just because they report something doesn't mean they're going to something doesn't mean they're going to something doesn't mean they're going to spin up like a war room. That we're not spin up like a war room. That we're not spin up like a war room. That we're not going to hop in a chat with their boss. going to hop in a chat with their boss. going to hop in a chat with their boss. That we're not like creating all this That we're not like creating all this That we're not like creating all this friction. Um but this is the bottoms up friction. Um but this is the bottoms up friction. Um but this is the bottoms up relationship where um they have to feel relationship where um they have to feel relationship where um they have to feel safe and be encouraged to talk about safe and be encouraged to talk about safe and be encouraged to talk about like, hey, this is this gnarly thing. like, hey, this is this gnarly thing. like, hey, this is this gnarly thing. And this is honestly before you buy a And this is honestly before you buy a And this is honestly before you buy a scanner, if you want a real sense of scanner, if you want a real sense of scanner, if you want a real sense of where to start, like you can just ask where to start, like you can just ask where to start, like you can just ask your devs like, "Hey, what's probably your devs like, "Hey, what's probably your devs like, "Hey, what's probably going to get us exploited?" And they'd going to get us exploited?" And they'd going to get us exploited?" And they'd be happy to say, "Oh, it's this thing." be happy to say, "Oh, it's this thing." be happy to say, "Oh, it's this thing." Like it's like a bragging thing. Um, so Like it's like a bragging thing. Um, so Like it's like a bragging thing. Um, so if you just change the nature of the if you just change the nature of the if you just change the nature of the conversation, um, that can increase conversation, um, that can increase conversation, um, that can increase self-reporting. Yeah, sure. Yeah, sure. Yeah, sure. grab you like this grab you like this grab you like this deja vu moment because I just had all of deja vu moment because I just had all of deja vu moment because I just had all of this conversation in one conversation this conversation in one conversation this conversation in one conversation that I've had about one CVE. Um, and um, that I've had about one CVE. Um, and um, that I've had about one CVE. Um, and um, so just to piggyback on what you said so just to piggyback on what you said so just to piggyback on what you said about the tools, I would like tools to about the tools, I would like tools to about the tools, I would like tools to stop trying to be the one tool to rule stop trying to be the one tool to rule stop trying to be the one tool to rule them all and to them all and to them all and to simply specify and simply specify what simply specify and simply specify what simply specify and simply specify what their tool does. Because I can cut a their tool does. Because I can cut a their tool does. Because I can cut a false positive conversation in half just false positive conversation in half just false positive conversation in half just by saying this tool scans for this by saying this tool scans for this by saying this tool scans for this version of this thing, true or not true. version of this thing, true or not true. version of this thing, true or not true. Um so that was that. Um my question yeah Um so that was that. Um my question yeah Um so that was that. Um my question yeah just on that the problem is they're just on that the problem is they're just on that the problem is they're incentivized not to tell you what they incentivized not to tell you what they incentivized not to tell you what they don't do well. So yeah but I'm don't do well. So yeah but I'm don't do well. So yeah but I'm completely with you on um but so then we completely with you on um but so then we completely with you on um but so then we have to in vulnerability management have to in vulnerability management have to in vulnerability management which is not one thing is a bunch of which is not one thing is a bunch of which is not one thing is a bunch of different things. different things. different things. Um sorry lost my train of thought. Oh Um sorry lost my train of thought. Oh Um sorry lost my train of thought. Oh yes. Um that the different conversations yes. Um that the different conversations yes. Um that the different conversations and the language from the developer and and the language from the developer and and the language from the developer and then from the person who's doing the then from the person who's doing the then from the person who's doing the scan and then the CEO and then the legal scan and then the CEO and then the legal scan and then the CEO and then the legal department and then the marketing department and then the marketing department and then the marketing department. Um like right now the fact department. Um like right now the fact department. Um like right now the fact that there's a legal definition for a that there's a legal definition for a that there's a legal definition for a vulnerability that now I have to do vulnerability that now I have to do vulnerability that now I have to do things a little bit different. I started things a little bit different. I started things a little bit different. I started that I did have a question at the start that I did have a question at the start that I did have a question at the start of it's gone. But it's a good note. of it's gone. But it's a good note. of it's gone. But it's a good note. Yeah. Yeah. So I I'll fix that. I think Yeah. Yeah. So I I'll fix that. I think Yeah. Yeah. So I I'll fix that. I think we're at time, right? Well, do you have we're at time, right? Well, do you have we're at time, right? Well, do you have a short one? All right. Francisco. a short one? All right. Francisco. a short one? All right. Francisco. Hello. Oh, Frank. Uh, do we have a Hello. Oh, Frank. Uh, do we have a Hello. Oh, Frank. Uh, do we have a vulnerability and prioritization problem vulnerability and prioritization problem vulnerability and prioritization problem or do we have an asset attribution and or do we have an asset attribution and or do we have an asset attribution and remediation problem in this industry? No, I agree. No, I agree. No, I agree. It's it's an asset remediation thing. It's it's an asset remediation thing. It's it's an asset remediation thing. Yeah, I guess I guess I agree too. I Yeah, I guess I guess I agree too. I Yeah, I guess I guess I agree too. I mean, if we're gonna go I mean, asset mean, if we're gonna go I mean, asset mean, if we're gonna go I mean, asset management was like my number one thing management was like my number one thing management was like my number one thing anyways. And I think that Yeah, if we anyways. And I think that Yeah, if we anyways. And I think that Yeah, if we Yeah, that's I agree. Some some would Yeah, that's I agree. Some some would Yeah, that's I agree. Some some would say we even have a software engineering say we even have a software engineering say we even have a software engineering problem that coming up with the problem that coming up with the problem that coming up with the vulnerabilities. So, it's it's a vulnerabilities. So, it's it's a vulnerabilities. So, it's it's a question of how far back you go. But question of how far back you go. But question of how far back you go. But yeah, definitely a good point. Awesome. yeah, definitely a good point. Awesome. yeah, definitely a good point. Awesome. That that brings us to time right there. That that brings us to time right there. That that brings us to time right there. So, uh, another round of applause for So, uh, another round of applause for So, uh, another round of applause for our panel discussion today.
