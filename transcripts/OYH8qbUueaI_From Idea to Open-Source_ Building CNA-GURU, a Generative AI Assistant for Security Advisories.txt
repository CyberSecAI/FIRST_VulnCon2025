We're the team AWS security outreach. We're the team AWS security outreach. We're the team responsible for coordinated deliver uh responsible for coordinated deliver uh responsible for coordinated deliver uh coordinated vulnerability disclosure at coordinated vulnerability disclosure at coordinated vulnerability disclosure at AWS. And uh I've got a bunch of AWS. And uh I've got a bunch of AWS. And uh I've got a bunch of accolades. They're not really relevant. accolades. They're not really relevant. accolades. They're not really relevant. So, if you care to communicate, just hit So, if you care to communicate, just hit So, if you care to communicate, just hit me up. Uh the QR code goes to my me up. Uh the QR code goes to my me up. Uh the QR code goes to my LinkedIn or I'm on like the cloud LinkedIn or I'm on like the cloud LinkedIn or I'm on like the cloud security forums if you want to chat. security forums if you want to chat. security forums if you want to chat. So, I'm really excited because one of So, I'm really excited because one of So, I'm really excited because one of the things that I'm very very always the things that I'm very very always the things that I'm very very always interested in is improving my quality of interested in is improving my quality of interested in is improving my quality of life. Uh, it's really selfish, but the life. Uh, it's really selfish, but the life. Uh, it's really selfish, but the main thing about it is if you're doing main thing about it is if you're doing main thing about it is if you're doing repeated stuff over and over and over repeated stuff over and over and over repeated stuff over and over and over again, it gets tiresome and it's hard to again, it gets tiresome and it's hard to again, it gets tiresome and it's hard to scale people up to do it. So, with the scale people up to do it. So, with the scale people up to do it. So, with the new CNA directives uh that came about in new CNA directives uh that came about in new CNA directives uh that came about in 2024, I wanted to find a way to scale 2024, I wanted to find a way to scale 2024, I wanted to find a way to scale this. So because of this what we want to this. So because of this what we want to this. So because of this what we want to do is we want to take a lot of the basic do is we want to take a lot of the basic do is we want to take a lot of the basic things that we have to teach our things that we have to teach our things that we have to teach our analysts to do over and over and over analysts to do over and over and over analysts to do over and over and over again and requires a certain amount of again and requires a certain amount of again and requires a certain amount of time to train them. So let's jump on time to train them. So let's jump on time to train them. So let's jump on into it. So to clarify the git repo into it. So to clarify the git repo into it. So to clarify the git repo itself is called chatbot to help itself is called chatbot to help itself is called chatbot to help security teams perform vulnerability security teams perform vulnerability security teams perform vulnerability assessments because it gets branded by a assessments because it gets branded by a assessments because it gets branded by a lawyer. So, what most people are calling lawyer. So, what most people are calling lawyer. So, what most people are calling it is well, we called it CNA Guru as a it is well, we called it CNA Guru as a it is well, we called it CNA Guru as a nickname. Uh, thanks to Chris Ferris, nickname. Uh, thanks to Chris Ferris, nickname. Uh, thanks to Chris Ferris, now I'm calling it chat CVE because he's now I'm calling it chat CVE because he's now I'm calling it chat CVE because he's better at naming things. better at naming things. better at naming things. And yeah, call out to Chris. So, why did And yeah, call out to Chris. So, why did And yeah, call out to Chris. So, why did we build the assistance? Well, scoring we build the assistance? Well, scoring we build the assistance? Well, scoring vulnerabilities is hard and uh training vulnerabilities is hard and uh training vulnerabilities is hard and uh training humans is harder. So, if this is a humans is harder. So, if this is a humans is harder. So, if this is a really like niche skill set, why would really like niche skill set, why would really like niche skill set, why would we even build something like this? Well, we even build something like this? Well, we even build something like this? Well, like we said at Vulcon last year, we like we said at Vulcon last year, we like we said at Vulcon last year, we were talking about all the new rules were talking about all the new rules were talking about all the new rules that came about. And one of the things that came about. And one of the things that came about. And one of the things with those new rules is it's requiring with those new rules is it's requiring with those new rules is it's requiring more companies and software builders to more companies and software builders to more companies and software builders to do CNA type work that they did not do CNA type work that they did not do CNA type work that they did not previously do, wasn't part of their previously do, wasn't part of their previously do, wasn't part of their training, wasn't part of their education training, wasn't part of their education training, wasn't part of their education or their skill sets. So, what we want to or their skill sets. So, what we want to or their skill sets. So, what we want to do is try and lower the bar to entry for do is try and lower the bar to entry for do is try and lower the bar to entry for people and allow them to kind of punch people and allow them to kind of punch people and allow them to kind of punch above their weight class. So, last year above their weight class. So, last year above their weight class. So, last year we had a couple of these sessions. We're we had a couple of these sessions. We're we had a couple of these sessions. We're talking about the new rules. I talking about the new rules. I talking about the new rules. I complained loudly about trying to complained loudly about trying to complained loudly about trying to translate uh and train uh engineers to translate uh and train uh engineers to translate uh and train uh engineers to do stuff and uh a bunch of people came do stuff and uh a bunch of people came do stuff and uh a bunch of people came over to talk about it. Sarah Evans, uh over to talk about it. Sarah Evans, uh over to talk about it. Sarah Evans, uh Casmir Schultz, Christian Sver, all Casmir Schultz, Christian Sver, all Casmir Schultz, Christian Sver, all these guys. Uh we all sat at different these guys. Uh we all sat at different these guys. Uh we all sat at different at the same table and we had a a kind of at the same table and we had a a kind of at the same table and we had a a kind of a common complaint, you know, and after a common complaint, you know, and after a common complaint, you know, and after about an hour, we brainstormed a little about an hour, we brainstormed a little about an hour, we brainstormed a little bit, threw our complaints back and bit, threw our complaints back and bit, threw our complaints back and forth, and this is what came out of forth, and this is what came out of forth, and this is what came out of that. I went home that night and I that. I went home that night and I that. I went home that night and I started building. Um because I build um started building. Um because I build um started building. Um because I build um I don't really learn. So how did we I don't really learn. So how did we I don't really learn. So how did we build this? Well, the first thing that build this? Well, the first thing that build this? Well, the first thing that we did is try to figure out how to put we did is try to figure out how to put we did is try to figure out how to put together infrastructure to do this, together infrastructure to do this, together infrastructure to do this, right? Infrastructure is expensive. It's right? Infrastructure is expensive. It's right? Infrastructure is expensive. It's complicated. Uh you have to worry about complicated. Uh you have to worry about complicated. Uh you have to worry about reliability and all these other things. reliability and all these other things. reliability and all these other things. Well, my first version of this was like Well, my first version of this was like Well, my first version of this was like the island of misfit toys. I went up to the island of misfit toys. I went up to the island of misfit toys. I went up to the AWS labs examples and I looked at the AWS labs examples and I looked at the AWS labs examples and I looked at all the CDK in Python that had to all the CDK in Python that had to all the CDK in Python that had to interact with chat bots and stuff and I interact with chat bots and stuff and I interact with chat bots and stuff and I was able to grab uh some interesting uh was able to grab uh some interesting uh was able to grab uh some interesting uh examples that existed previously and it examples that existed previously and it examples that existed previously and it allowed me to build my desired user allowed me to build my desired user allowed me to build my desired user experience. What would this be useful to experience. What would this be useful to experience. What would this be useful to do? We needed something portable that do? We needed something portable that do? We needed something portable that people could run in different places, people could run in different places, people could run in different places, easy to deploy, right? We want it to be easy to deploy, right? We want it to be easy to deploy, right? We want it to be almost natural language processing, almost natural language processing, almost natural language processing, though that's way fancier than what though that's way fancier than what though that's way fancier than what we're actually doing. But we want we're actually doing. But we want we're actually doing. But we want somebody to be able to enter in a somebody to be able to enter in a somebody to be able to enter in a vulnerability description in words that vulnerability description in words that vulnerability description in words that they would actually use to talk to they would actually use to talk to they would actually use to talk to people and be able to work off of that. people and be able to work off of that. people and be able to work off of that. Then what it would do is it would take Then what it would do is it would take Then what it would do is it would take that data and use a customized prompt that data and use a customized prompt that data and use a customized prompt that allows it to search our knowledge that allows it to search our knowledge that allows it to search our knowledge base with context. And then lastly, what base with context. And then lastly, what base with context. And then lastly, what it does is it uses that context from the it does is it uses that context from the it does is it uses that context from the knowledge base and the user inputed knowledge base and the user inputed knowledge base and the user inputed information to match data. So that's how information to match data. So that's how information to match data. So that's how we're doing the linking between the we're doing the linking between the we're doing the linking between the natural English language stuff and what natural English language stuff and what natural English language stuff and what is in the knowledge database. So the is in the knowledge database. So the is in the knowledge database. So the knowledge database itself is built off knowledge database itself is built off knowledge database itself is built off of all the data that you get from the of all the data that you get from the of all the data that you get from the first website on first website on first website on CVDs, C.WE, all that guidance stuff CVDs, C.WE, all that guidance stuff CVDs, C.WE, all that guidance stuff that's all public. That's the only stuff that's all public. That's the only stuff that's all public. That's the only stuff that was used for this. So all of you that was used for this. So all of you that was used for this. So all of you can repeat this. It's all free and can repeat this. It's all free and can repeat this. It's all free and public. So let's talk about that um public. So let's talk about that um public. So let's talk about that um actual infrastructure that we're actual infrastructure that we're actual infrastructure that we're building. This cool diagram I didn't building. This cool diagram I didn't building. This cool diagram I didn't actually have to build because it actually have to build because it actually have to build because it already existed in an existing project. already existed in an existing project. already existed in an existing project. This was taken from a um another project This was taken from a um another project This was taken from a um another project from AWS Labs that was about creating from AWS Labs that was about creating from AWS Labs that was about creating images with bedrock. And there was a images with bedrock. And there was a images with bedrock. And there was a second project that allowed us to do second project that allowed us to do second project that allowed us to do agent retrieval, which is how I thought agent retrieval, which is how I thought agent retrieval, which is how I thought I wanted to do this the first way, I wanted to do this the first way, I wanted to do this the first way, foreshadowing. So, the chatbot itself foreshadowing. So, the chatbot itself foreshadowing. So, the chatbot itself was built just interacting with Amazon was built just interacting with Amazon was built just interacting with Amazon Bedrock. Um, the front end of it is Bedrock. Um, the front end of it is Bedrock. Um, the front end of it is Streamlit, which is an open source chat Streamlit, which is an open source chat Streamlit, which is an open source chat thing. All of you can use it. It's free thing. All of you can use it. It's free thing. All of you can use it. It's free online. um to actually host stuff we're online. um to actually host stuff we're online. um to actually host stuff we're using the ECS so container services you using the ECS so container services you using the ECS so container services you know docker in the cloud kind of thing know docker in the cloud kind of thing know docker in the cloud kind of thing uh and we're using AWS Fargate to do it uh and we're using AWS Fargate to do it uh and we're using AWS Fargate to do it because of when I built this certain because of when I built this certain because of when I built this certain features were required for the ECS um so features were required for the ECS um so features were required for the ECS um so we chose to use Fargate for that we chose to use Fargate for that we chose to use Fargate for that now this looks big and complex and now this looks big and complex and now this looks big and complex and that's one of the reasons uh that we're that's one of the reasons uh that we're that's one of the reasons uh that we're going to talk about the next milestones going to talk about the next milestones going to talk about the next milestones in the project. So going up to here, in the project. So going up to here, in the project. So going up to here, some of the key features that we're some of the key features that we're some of the key features that we're going to be talking about that work with going to be talking about that work with going to be talking about that work with this. What you're looking at is the this. What you're looking at is the this. What you're looking at is the streamlit output. So this is that fun streamlit output. So this is that fun streamlit output. So this is that fun little chatbot front end. Um, one of the little chatbot front end. Um, one of the little chatbot front end. Um, one of the favorite my favorite things about this favorite my favorite things about this favorite my favorite things about this is the the amount of time it takes away is the the amount of time it takes away is the the amount of time it takes away uh from repetitive training. All right. uh from repetitive training. All right. uh from repetitive training. All right. Who here has ever tra had to train Who here has ever tra had to train Who here has ever tra had to train someone to score a someone to score a someone to score a CVE? Yeah. All right. CVE? Yeah. All right. CVE? Yeah. All right. And how long did that And how long did that And how long did that take? Yeah, way too long. So long. Um, take? Yeah, way too long. So long. Um, take? Yeah, way too long. So long. Um, like I didn't have any gray hair when I like I didn't have any gray hair when I like I didn't have any gray hair when I started training them and now I'm started training them and now I'm started training them and now I'm bald. So, one of the problems with that bald. So, one of the problems with that bald. So, one of the problems with that is follow up and context questions, is follow up and context questions, is follow up and context questions, right? Everyone can make a list, a right? Everyone can make a list, a right? Everyone can make a list, a runbook, a thing of set questions for runbook, a thing of set questions for runbook, a thing of set questions for people to follow in a straight path. But people to follow in a straight path. But people to follow in a straight path. But the more you work with vulnerabilities, the more you work with vulnerabilities, the more you work with vulnerabilities, the more you realize everyone's a unique the more you realize everyone's a unique the more you realize everyone's a unique snowflake of them and they're all going snowflake of them and they're all going snowflake of them and they're all going to be different in different ways and to be different in different ways and to be different in different ways and always something's going to be always something's going to be always something's going to be different. How do you react to the different. How do you react to the different. How do you react to the changing context as you go through your changing context as you go through your changing context as you go through your normal workflow? Well, you do that with normal workflow? Well, you do that with normal workflow? Well, you do that with follow-up questions. So, contextual follow-up questions. So, contextual follow-up questions. So, contextual follow-up questions. It's the same way follow-up questions. It's the same way follow-up questions. It's the same way that you would work with your mentor that you would work with your mentor that you would work with your mentor trying to learn this. They say, you trying to learn this. They say, you trying to learn this. They say, you know, how to do steps one, two, three, know, how to do steps one, two, three, know, how to do steps one, two, three, but you don't understand how two and but you don't understand how two and but you don't understand how two and three connect. So, you ask a follow-up three connect. So, you ask a follow-up three connect. So, you ask a follow-up question, you ask for context, you ask question, you ask for context, you ask question, you ask for context, you ask for further explanation, and that's what for further explanation, and that's what for further explanation, and that's what I wanted to build into the assistant, I wanted to build into the assistant, I wanted to build into the assistant, right? This is not a replacement for right? This is not a replacement for right? This is not a replacement for humans. This is about offering humans. This is about offering humans. This is about offering assistance and help to people and assistance and help to people and assistance and help to people and getting them to the answers that they getting them to the answers that they getting them to the answers that they need to make educated decisions faster. need to make educated decisions faster. need to make educated decisions faster. So, we're trying to empower the human So, we're trying to empower the human So, we're trying to empower the human with this, not replace them. So, one of with this, not replace them. So, one of with this, not replace them. So, one of the questions that we see here is we the questions that we see here is we the questions that we see here is we asked it uh to calculate a C.WE and a asked it uh to calculate a C.WE and a asked it uh to calculate a C.WE and a CVSS score. Well, we didn't agree with CVSS score. Well, we didn't agree with CVSS score. Well, we didn't agree with what C.WE decided for determination. We what C.WE decided for determination. We what C.WE decided for determination. We were able to ask it a follow-up were able to ask it a follow-up were able to ask it a follow-up question. Why did you choose this CWE question. Why did you choose this CWE question. Why did you choose this CWE over another one? And it was a very over another one? And it was a very over another one? And it was a very simple, straightforward answer. It's simple, straightforward answer. It's simple, straightforward answer. It's because the text that was entered by the because the text that was entered by the because the text that was entered by the human had certain phrases that mapped to human had certain phrases that mapped to human had certain phrases that mapped to that CWE. that CWE. that CWE. Now, why did this one come up versus the Now, why did this one come up versus the Now, why did this one come up versus the one that the human that evaluated this one that the human that evaluated this one that the human that evaluated this chose? Well, we're going to go into that chose? Well, we're going to go into that chose? Well, we're going to go into that with some of our metrics in a bit, but with some of our metrics in a bit, but with some of our metrics in a bit, but other talks about LLM said this today. other talks about LLM said this today. other talks about LLM said this today. Oh, not today, this week. LLMs tend to Oh, not today, this week. LLMs tend to Oh, not today, this week. LLMs tend to go lower down on the parent lineage for go lower down on the parent lineage for go lower down on the parent lineage for C.WE. humans tend to go higher up in C.WE. humans tend to go higher up in C.WE. humans tend to go higher up in that umbrella because it's encompassing that umbrella because it's encompassing that umbrella because it's encompassing where the the AI stuff tends to go to where the the AI stuff tends to go to where the the AI stuff tends to go to that umbrella and then go down a few that umbrella and then go down a few that umbrella and then go down a few steps. So that's sometimes good and steps. So that's sometimes good and steps. So that's sometimes good and sometimes bad. Uh and we'll talk about sometimes bad. Uh and we'll talk about sometimes bad. Uh and we'll talk about that in a that in a that in a minute. So next up in this example, uh minute. So next up in this example, uh minute. So next up in this example, uh we wanted a general knowledge question. we wanted a general knowledge question. we wanted a general knowledge question. So once again, this is training for So once again, this is training for So once again, this is training for analysts, not people that know what analysts, not people that know what analysts, not people that know what they're doing. Uh though this is helpful they're doing. Uh though this is helpful they're doing. Uh though this is helpful for me too because I don't really know for me too because I don't really know for me too because I don't really know what I'm doing. So sometimes I have dumb what I'm doing. So sometimes I have dumb what I'm doing. So sometimes I have dumb questions like I forgot what a certain questions like I forgot what a certain questions like I forgot what a certain vector string in a CVSs score is. vector string in a CVSs score is. vector string in a CVSs score is. Explain it to me. Why do I care about Explain it to me. Why do I care about Explain it to me. Why do I care about this? Why is it network versus local this? Why is it network versus local this? Why is it network versus local versus whatever? All right. So in this versus whatever? All right. So in this versus whatever? All right. So in this case uh we're asking some basic case uh we're asking some basic case uh we're asking some basic questions like what is a CWE and we get questions like what is a CWE and we get questions like what is a CWE and we get an answer. Then we can ask a follow-up an answer. Then we can ask a follow-up an answer. Then we can ask a follow-up question or we can submit a question or we can submit a question or we can submit a vulnerability description now that we vulnerability description now that we vulnerability description now that we remember what a C.WE we use is and get remember what a C.WE we use is and get remember what a C.WE we use is and get it to be scored and calculated. I love it to be scored and calculated. I love it to be scored and calculated. I love the feature uh personally because I have the feature uh personally because I have the feature uh personally because I have to answer this a lot when I train to answer this a lot when I train to answer this a lot when I train people. So, it's very nice where I don't people. So, it's very nice where I don't people. So, it's very nice where I don't have to repeat myself of like the basic have to repeat myself of like the basic have to repeat myself of like the basic things over and over. You know, things over and over. You know, things over and over. You know, everybody has a wiki page with a bunch everybody has a wiki page with a bunch everybody has a wiki page with a bunch of definitions of different things and of definitions of different things and of definitions of different things and explanations of their common tools. I explanations of their common tools. I explanations of their common tools. I don't have to copy and paste. Go read don't have to copy and paste. Go read don't have to copy and paste. Go read this, right? You just ask the assistant this, right? You just ask the assistant this, right? You just ask the assistant your question as you feel it. And your question as you feel it. And your question as you feel it. And because of that, we've noticed that because of that, we've noticed that because of that, we've noticed that analysts are less skittish about asking analysts are less skittish about asking analysts are less skittish about asking questions to uh their like tech leads questions to uh their like tech leads questions to uh their like tech leads and stuff because now they can ask what and stuff because now they can ask what and stuff because now they can ask what they believe is a dumb question to the they believe is a dumb question to the they believe is a dumb question to the the AI bot and ask it to give them some the AI bot and ask it to give them some the AI bot and ask it to give them some context and then it allows them to build context and then it allows them to build context and then it allows them to build a better question because now they a better question because now they a better question because now they understand more context about it and understand more context about it and understand more context about it and they start to understand this is the gap they start to understand this is the gap they start to understand this is the gap what they start to understand they know what they start to understand they know what they start to understand they know what they don't know kind of thing and what they don't know kind of thing and what they don't know kind of thing and using this as part of the training is using this as part of the training is using this as part of the training is helpful. So evaluation and accuracy, helpful. So evaluation and accuracy, helpful. So evaluation and accuracy, this is a huge debate, you know, for LLM this is a huge debate, you know, for LLM this is a huge debate, you know, for LLM accuracy, right? We all know that that accuracy, right? We all know that that accuracy, right? We all know that that AI hallucinates, right? How do we deal AI hallucinates, right? How do we deal AI hallucinates, right? How do we deal with that? Well, in fairness, most with that? Well, in fairness, most with that? Well, in fairness, most engineers I work with hallucinate. So engineers I work with hallucinate. So engineers I work with hallucinate. So really, we're using the same kind of really, we're using the same kind of really, we're using the same kind of guard rails, right? We don't let this AI guard rails, right? We don't let this AI guard rails, right? We don't let this AI drink during work hours. And we also drink during work hours. And we also drink during work hours. And we also make sure we give it guidelines for what make sure we give it guidelines for what make sure we give it guidelines for what it can and can't do. And that's part of it can and can't do. And that's part of it can and can't do. And that's part of the custom prompt that we we work with. the custom prompt that we we work with. the custom prompt that we we work with. But some of the accuracy stuff. So the But some of the accuracy stuff. So the But some of the accuracy stuff. So the engagement time went down, right? That I engagement time went down, right? That I engagement time went down, right? That I think is one of the most important think is one of the most important think is one of the most important things. The uh the ROI highlights. So things. The uh the ROI highlights. So things. The uh the ROI highlights. So when I say three hours to analyze, when I say three hours to analyze, when I say three hours to analyze, that's a trained uh like I've signed off that's a trained uh like I've signed off that's a trained uh like I've signed off that they know how to Google what a C.WE that they know how to Google what a C.WE that they know how to Google what a C.WE is kind of stuff. And I feel that they is kind of stuff. And I feel that they is kind of stuff. And I feel that they can score things on their own. takes can score things on their own. takes can score things on their own. takes them roughly three hours to go from them roughly three hours to go from them roughly three hours to go from here's a vulnerability description to here's a vulnerability description to here's a vulnerability description to scoring C.WE determination, a small scoring C.WE determination, a small scoring C.WE determination, a small write up justification, you know, write up justification, you know, write up justification, you know, basically building out all the basically building out all the basically building out all the information for either a CVE submission information for either a CVE submission information for either a CVE submission or a GHSA or a GHSA or a GHSA submission. With the tool, they were submission. With the tool, they were submission. With the tool, they were able to take the 3 hours and cut it down able to take the 3 hours and cut it down able to take the 3 hours and cut it down to just a few minutes because they were to just a few minutes because they were to just a few minutes because they were able to ask the same questions. And then able to ask the same questions. And then able to ask the same questions. And then I'll show you some of the other cool I'll show you some of the other cool I'll show you some of the other cool features that we use to help them build features that we use to help them build features that we use to help them build their responses and writeups in the their responses and writeups in the their responses and writeups in the first draft of them to allow the human first draft of them to allow the human first draft of them to allow the human to edit. Because I don't know about you, to edit. Because I don't know about you, to edit. Because I don't know about you, but staring at a blank page and going, but staring at a blank page and going, but staring at a blank page and going, "Shit, I need to describe a "Shit, I need to describe a "Shit, I need to describe a vulnerability is like it's a large jump, vulnerability is like it's a large jump, vulnerability is like it's a large jump, right? It's that barrier to entry that right? It's that barrier to entry that right? It's that barrier to entry that kind of scares people." This is lowering kind of scares people." This is lowering kind of scares people." This is lowering that barrier to entry. Another thing uh that barrier to entry. Another thing uh that barrier to entry. Another thing uh that people thought was pretty cool was that people thought was pretty cool was that people thought was pretty cool was the actual accuracy we got out of it. the actual accuracy we got out of it. the actual accuracy we got out of it. This is a small sample size of only 300 This is a small sample size of only 300 This is a small sample size of only 300 vulnerabilities. I know there's more vulnerabilities. I know there's more vulnerabilities. I know there's more than 300. So, I only afforded time to do than 300. So, I only afforded time to do than 300. So, I only afforded time to do 300 for checking cuz I paid for this. 300 for checking cuz I paid for this. 300 for checking cuz I paid for this. So, if you guys got credit cards, let me So, if you guys got credit cards, let me So, if you guys got credit cards, let me know. We'll start scanning. Uh but we know. We'll start scanning. Uh but we know. We'll start scanning. Uh but we got roughly 90% accuracy for the 300 got roughly 90% accuracy for the 300 got roughly 90% accuracy for the 300 randomly chosen CVEes. We got we went to randomly chosen CVEes. We got we went to randomly chosen CVEes. We got we went to the NVD database and those fun people the NVD database and those fun people the NVD database and those fun people that I mentioned earlier. We sat at a that I mentioned earlier. We sat at a that I mentioned earlier. We sat at a table last year and they gave me two table last year and they gave me two table last year and they gave me two numbers. The first number was what numbers. The first number was what numbers. The first number was what random page of NVD results to go to and random page of NVD results to go to and random page of NVD results to go to and the second number was which CVE on the the second number was which CVE on the the second number was which CVE on the page to grab. And we grabbed 300 that page to grab. And we grabbed 300 that page to grab. And we grabbed 300 that way and threw them through. and they all way and threw them through. and they all way and threw them through. and they all were scored within were scored within were scored within 0.2 on CVSS scoring and it gives three 0.2 on CVSS scoring and it gives three 0.2 on CVSS scoring and it gives three options for C.WE. And the CWE mentioned options for C.WE. And the CWE mentioned options for C.WE. And the CWE mentioned in the on the NVD page matched uh about in the on the NVD page matched uh about in the on the NVD page matched uh about 90% of the time as well. And when it 90% of the time as well. And when it 90% of the time as well. And when it didn't match, the majority of the time didn't match, the majority of the time didn't match, the majority of the time was it was using a C.WE that was lower was it was using a C.WE that was lower was it was using a C.WE that was lower down in the lineage. So, a more niche, down in the lineage. So, a more niche, down in the lineage. So, a more niche, narrow scoped one. Uh, there were some narrow scoped one. Uh, there were some narrow scoped one. Uh, there were some that were just blatantly wrong, right? that were just blatantly wrong, right? that were just blatantly wrong, right? Um, but one of the reasons for that was Um, but one of the reasons for that was Um, but one of the reasons for that was the verbiage that's used in the the verbiage that's used in the the verbiage that's used in the vulnerability description. It was very vulnerability description. It was very vulnerability description. It was very poor verbiage. Um, I won't name the poor verbiage. Um, I won't name the poor verbiage. Um, I won't name the vendor, they're huge, but they use very vendor, they're huge, but they use very vendor, they're huge, but they use very generic language which doesn't really generic language which doesn't really generic language which doesn't really help to tell you what the vulnerability help to tell you what the vulnerability help to tell you what the vulnerability is. And because of that, it didn't score is. And because of that, it didn't score is. And because of that, it didn't score it as severe as it actually was. when we it as severe as it actually was. when we it as severe as it actually was. when we went and looked at the CVE was a little went and looked at the CVE was a little went and looked at the CVE was a little more uh vicious. So that's why the score more uh vicious. So that's why the score more uh vicious. So that's why the score on NVD matched and made sense. But I on NVD matched and made sense. But I on NVD matched and made sense. But I wanted to bring those up because you're wanted to bring those up because you're wanted to bring those up because you're going to see, you know, your mileage may going to see, you know, your mileage may going to see, you know, your mileage may vary. And also we do a little bit of vary. And also we do a little bit of vary. And also we do a little bit of tuning to our prompt for contextual tuning to our prompt for contextual tuning to our prompt for contextual things like I have a different scope and things like I have a different scope and things like I have a different scope and a different risk surface than you guys a different risk surface than you guys a different risk surface than you guys do, right? So you are going to have to do, right? So you are going to have to do, right? So you are going to have to do a little bit of fine-tuning once you do a little bit of fine-tuning once you do a little bit of fine-tuning once you start putting your vulnerabilities and start putting your vulnerabilities and start putting your vulnerabilities and stuff through it to make sure it answers stuff through it to make sure it answers stuff through it to make sure it answers questions from your perspective, not questions from your perspective, not questions from your perspective, not mine. So evolution, we I started talking mine. So evolution, we I started talking mine. So evolution, we I started talking about this a little bit because I wanted about this a little bit because I wanted about this a little bit because I wanted to show off the infrastructure of the to show off the infrastructure of the to show off the infrastructure of the first thing we built. The first time we first thing we built. The first time we first thing we built. The first time we built it, it was that huge built it, it was that huge built it, it was that huge infrastructure because I used infrastructure because I used infrastructure because I used pre-existing stuff just to get the pre-existing stuff just to get the pre-existing stuff just to get the basics out there and then work on the basics out there and then work on the basics out there and then work on the prompt, the knowledge base, and the prompt, the knowledge base, and the prompt, the knowledge base, and the things that would give me the relevant things that would give me the relevant things that would give me the relevant answers. Well, that was great. Uh, it answers. Well, that was great. Uh, it answers. Well, that was great. Uh, it was really accurate at the time. It was was really accurate at the time. It was was really accurate at the time. It was fast. Uh, but it was expensive. Uh, I fast. Uh, but it was expensive. Uh, I fast. Uh, but it was expensive. Uh, I thought it was pretty cheap when I was thought it was pretty cheap when I was thought it was pretty cheap when I was developing it. And then I opened it up developing it. And then I opened it up developing it. And then I opened it up to a team of 10 people for a month and to a team of 10 people for a month and to a team of 10 people for a month and was asked to shut it off. So um we we was asked to shut it off. So um we we was asked to shut it off. So um we we found a lot of value in the tool but not found a lot of value in the tool but not found a lot of value in the tool but not enough to justify the cost which is a enough to justify the cost which is a enough to justify the cost which is a common problem we have. You got a great common problem we have. You got a great common problem we have. You got a great tool but you can't afford it. So what tool but you can't afford it. So what tool but you can't afford it. So what did we do? We created CNA Guru Jr. Uh did we do? We created CNA Guru Jr. Uh did we do? We created CNA Guru Jr. Uh this is a stripped down version. Um this is a stripped down version. Um this is a stripped down version. Um instead of using the knowledge base instead of using the knowledge base instead of using the knowledge base which in AWS using bedrock knowledge which in AWS using bedrock knowledge which in AWS using bedrock knowledge base you use knowledgebased agents. It's base you use knowledgebased agents. It's base you use knowledgebased agents. It's there's an open search index, there's there's an open search index, there's there's an open search index, there's the knowledge base itself, there's the the knowledge base itself, there's the the knowledge base itself, there's the S3 bucket storage cost, you know, it S3 bucket storage cost, you know, it S3 bucket storage cost, you know, it adds up. So, we stripped a lot of that adds up. So, we stripped a lot of that adds up. So, we stripped a lot of that out and we decided that if we can choose out and we decided that if we can choose out and we decided that if we can choose a model to use that is trained on the a model to use that is trained on the a model to use that is trained on the NVD data, um, we can use like a local NVD data, um, we can use like a local NVD data, um, we can use like a local rag system or something like that to rag system or something like that to rag system or something like that to input our custom knowledge and then use input our custom knowledge and then use input our custom knowledge and then use the same prompt. Uh, so that's what we the same prompt. Uh, so that's what we the same prompt. Uh, so that's what we did for CNA Guru Jr. And it ended up did for CNA Guru Jr. And it ended up did for CNA Guru Jr. And it ended up reducing costs reducing costs reducing costs significantly. But as we were trying to significantly. But as we were trying to significantly. But as we were trying to onboard more teams to this, we ran into onboard more teams to this, we ran into onboard more teams to this, we ran into some issues. Namely, some issues. Namely, some issues. Namely, onboarding. How many of you know what onboarding. How many of you know what onboarding. How many of you know what CDK CDK CDK is? Exactly. Yeah, I know you work is? Exactly. Yeah, I know you work is? Exactly. Yeah, I know you work there. Uh, so no one raised their hand there. Uh, so no one raised their hand there. Uh, so no one raised their hand for those in line. That's not for those in line. That's not for those in line. That's not unsurprising. CDK is AWS's um like unsurprising. CDK is AWS's um like unsurprising. CDK is AWS's um like infrastructure as code language. infrastructure as code language. infrastructure as code language. Basically, it allows it's like a middle Basically, it allows it's like a middle Basically, it allows it's like a middle layer that allows you to define what layer that allows you to define what layer that allows you to define what your infrastructure looks like, how to your infrastructure looks like, how to your infrastructure looks like, how to configure it, all that stuff. And then configure it, all that stuff. And then configure it, all that stuff. And then like you put your your infrastructure as like you put your your infrastructure as like you put your your infrastructure as code and version control and you can code and version control and you can code and version control and you can export export export whatever. That sounds really whatever. That sounds really whatever. That sounds really complicated, right? It's actually not complicated, right? It's actually not complicated, right? It's actually not complicated to do, but realistically complicated to do, but realistically complicated to do, but realistically reading it, it sounds overwhelming. And reading it, it sounds overwhelming. And reading it, it sounds overwhelming. And a lot of people weren't willing to learn a lot of people weren't willing to learn a lot of people weren't willing to learn how to deploy via CDK to get this how to deploy via CDK to get this how to deploy via CDK to get this infrastructure. So, how do we overcome infrastructure. So, how do we overcome infrastructure. So, how do we overcome that hurdle? Well, that's where I wrote that hurdle? Well, that's where I wrote that hurdle? Well, that's where I wrote CNA Guru Esquire. Uh, this is CNA Guru CNA Guru Esquire. Uh, this is CNA Guru CNA Guru Esquire. Uh, this is CNA Guru Jr. Uh, but it runs inside of Jupyter Jr. Uh, but it runs inside of Jupyter Jr. Uh, but it runs inside of Jupyter Notebook. So, that way it's super Notebook. So, that way it's super Notebook. So, that way it's super portable. You don't need to build extra portable. You don't need to build extra portable. You don't need to build extra infrastructure, but it still uses the infrastructure, but it still uses the infrastructure, but it still uses the same local rag and prompt and the same same local rag and prompt and the same same local rag and prompt and the same model as Skina Guru Jr., so it gets very model as Skina Guru Jr., so it gets very model as Skina Guru Jr., so it gets very similar results and it's similar similar results and it's similar similar results and it's similar pricing. Next up, let's talk about some pricing. Next up, let's talk about some pricing. Next up, let's talk about some of the evolutions. So, I'm going to of the evolutions. So, I'm going to of the evolutions. So, I'm going to bring you guys through a bunch of bring you guys through a bunch of bring you guys through a bunch of examples pretty quickly. We might examples pretty quickly. We might examples pretty quickly. We might speedrun them, but the main thing is I'm speedrun them, but the main thing is I'm speedrun them, but the main thing is I'm showing off different kinds of questions showing off different kinds of questions showing off different kinds of questions you can ask it and what type of you can ask it and what type of you can ask it and what type of responses you get. Here, uh, we're responses you get. Here, uh, we're responses you get. Here, uh, we're specifically looking at the simplistic specifically looking at the simplistic specifically looking at the simplistic questions that we can ask. So, this is questions that we can ask. So, this is questions that we can ask. So, this is our prompt. It gives you some basic uh, our prompt. It gives you some basic uh, our prompt. It gives you some basic uh, descriptions and definitions at the top. descriptions and definitions at the top. descriptions and definitions at the top. That is an example that you can submit That is an example that you can submit That is an example that you can submit into there. It it I've run it like a into there. It it I've run it like a into there. It it I've run it like a hundred times. It usually gives the hundred times. It usually gives the hundred times. It usually gives the perfect CVS and C.WE scores. So you can perfect CVS and C.WE scores. So you can perfect CVS and C.WE scores. So you can use it to test, but you know your basic use it to test, but you know your basic use it to test, but you know your basic question, what's a CVE? All that kind of question, what's a CVE? All that kind of question, what's a CVE? All that kind of fun stuff. But then in CNA Guru Esquire, fun stuff. But then in CNA Guru Esquire, fun stuff. But then in CNA Guru Esquire, uh what we're able to do with this is by uh what we're able to do with this is by uh what we're able to do with this is by running it in the Jupyter notebook, uh running it in the Jupyter notebook, uh running it in the Jupyter notebook, uh we actually created a chatbot we actually created a chatbot we actually created a chatbot experience. So that way when you ask experience. So that way when you ask experience. So that way when you ask your follow-up questions, it's still your follow-up questions, it's still your follow-up questions, it's still contextualized. So the AI keeps uh contextualized. So the AI keeps uh contextualized. So the AI keeps uh context of your entire conversation and context of your entire conversation and context of your entire conversation and that's going to be important in a that's going to be important in a that's going to be important in a minute. So the benefits and use cases we minute. So the benefits and use cases we minute. So the benefits and use cases we talked about the training, right? Uh one talked about the training, right? Uh one talked about the training, right? Uh one of the other cool things is scalability. of the other cool things is scalability. of the other cool things is scalability. You know everyone says serverless You know everyone says serverless You know everyone says serverless awesome sauce. Hi person taking a awesome sauce. Hi person taking a awesome sauce. Hi person taking a picture. Um so scalability matters. Um picture. Um so scalability matters. Um picture. Um so scalability matters. Um you know you might be a small shop you you know you might be a small shop you you know you might be a small shop you can stand up one or two instances. Um I can stand up one or two instances. Um I can stand up one or two instances. Um I work at AWS. We are ginormous. All work at AWS. We are ginormous. All work at AWS. We are ginormous. All right. In order to run this, I have a right. In order to run this, I have a right. In order to run this, I have a fleet of systems in order to run that fleet of systems in order to run that fleet of systems in order to run that many concurrent queries and stuff for many concurrent queries and stuff for many concurrent queries and stuff for people because not only do we use this people because not only do we use this people because not only do we use this for manual input, but we also do some for manual input, but we also do some for manual input, but we also do some automation that I'll talk about. What's automation that I'll talk about. What's automation that I'll talk about. What's really great about this is the really great about this is the really great about this is the flexibility. So, we talk about customer flexibility. So, we talk about customer flexibility. So, we talk about customer choice as like a company tenant and choice as like a company tenant and choice as like a company tenant and stuff like that, but in reality, I care stuff like that, but in reality, I care stuff like that, but in reality, I care more about how easy it is for you to more about how easy it is for you to more about how easy it is for you to use, right? Like I want you to be able use, right? Like I want you to be able use, right? Like I want you to be able to pick this up, drop it on your to pick this up, drop it on your to pick this up, drop it on your computer, load it up, and start kicking computer, load it up, and start kicking computer, load it up, and start kicking off with it. I want you to be able to off with it. I want you to be able to off with it. I want you to be able to fork this and with the documentation in fork this and with the documentation in fork this and with the documentation in the GitHub, understand how the the GitHub, understand how the the GitHub, understand how the components work so you can modify it for components work so you can modify it for components work so you can modify it for your needs. Like I want this to be a your needs. Like I want this to be a your needs. Like I want this to be a foundation for folks. So that's what I foundation for folks. So that's what I foundation for folks. So that's what I kind of find some of the benefits, you kind of find some of the benefits, you kind of find some of the benefits, you know, the flexibility, the extensibility know, the flexibility, the extensibility know, the flexibility, the extensibility of it. It's open source, it's flexible, of it. It's open source, it's flexible, of it. It's open source, it's flexible, you can plug in. So some of the common you can plug in. So some of the common you can plug in. So some of the common use cases that we get with this security use cases that we get with this security use cases that we get with this security advisory creation. So how do we draft up advisory creation. So how do we draft up advisory creation. So how do we draft up a CVE or GHSA analyst training support? a CVE or GHSA analyst training support? a CVE or GHSA analyst training support? That's what I harped on in the beginning That's what I harped on in the beginning That's what I harped on in the beginning because that's my main use case. I have because that's my main use case. I have because that's my main use case. I have a bunch of analysts I have to train and a bunch of analysts I have to train and a bunch of analysts I have to train and whether or not they're on a rotating whether or not they're on a rotating whether or not they're on a rotating clock through attrition. I still have to clock through attrition. I still have to clock through attrition. I still have to keep training people over and over and keep training people over and over and keep training people over and over and over again. This helps save me time over again. This helps save me time over again. This helps save me time there. And then quality assurance. I've there. And then quality assurance. I've there. And then quality assurance. I've been doing this for a lot of years. I been doing this for a lot of years. I been doing this for a lot of years. I still am terrible at it. Uh so I want to still am terrible at it. Uh so I want to still am terrible at it. Uh so I want to validate things. I want a second validate things. I want a second validate things. I want a second opinion. I want to validate what I said opinion. I want to validate what I said opinion. I want to validate what I said was was was right. So next up uh use case CNA right. So next up uh use case CNA right. So next up uh use case CNA related general knowledge. So this is related general knowledge. So this is related general knowledge. So this is inside CNA guru. Um it's really hard to inside CNA guru. Um it's really hard to inside CNA guru. Um it's really hard to do screenshots on something this size do screenshots on something this size do screenshots on something this size but suffice to say this is general but suffice to say this is general but suffice to say this is general knowledge questions up top. And then knowledge questions up top. And then knowledge questions up top. And then down here uh I ask for a CVS vector down here uh I ask for a CVS vector down here uh I ask for a CVS vector string for the vulnerability string for the vulnerability string for the vulnerability description. It gives me the scoring and description. It gives me the scoring and description. It gives me the scoring and it starts to answer some information for it starts to answer some information for it starts to answer some information for me. But let's move on to what it me. But let's move on to what it me. But let's move on to what it actually shows. So we build on the actually shows. So we build on the actually shows. So we build on the general knowledge and in this we ask the general knowledge and in this we ask the general knowledge and in this we ask the assistant to calculate that CVS score assistant to calculate that CVS score assistant to calculate that CVS score and also it gives us the vector string. and also it gives us the vector string. and also it gives us the vector string. It gives us a quote from the string of It gives us a quote from the string of It gives us a quote from the string of data that the user inputed and it gives data that the user inputed and it gives data that the user inputed and it gives us a quote from the knowledge base. So I us a quote from the knowledge base. So I us a quote from the knowledge base. So I don't have to convince you that these don't have to convince you that these don't have to convince you that these two things match. This is a quote from two things match. This is a quote from two things match. This is a quote from both what the human inputed and was both what the human inputed and was both what the human inputed and was taken out of the knowledge base. If you taken out of the knowledge base. If you taken out of the knowledge base. If you can't one to one that learn to can't one to one that learn to can't one to one that learn to read, you heard me. Uh next up, uh the read, you heard me. Uh next up, uh the read, you heard me. Uh next up, uh the CWE portion, determining a CWE. Well, CWE portion, determining a CWE. Well, CWE portion, determining a CWE. Well, trying to do it the first time or just trying to do it the first time or just trying to do it the first time or just trying to get one really hard. I started trying to get one really hard. I started trying to get one really hard. I started this off with giving 10 as a result for this off with giving 10 as a result for this off with giving 10 as a result for the user to choose from. We cut it to the user to choose from. We cut it to the user to choose from. We cut it to three because options are hard. So now three because options are hard. So now three because options are hard. So now this gives the top what it considers to this gives the top what it considers to this gives the top what it considers to be the three most relevant or related be the three most relevant or related be the three most relevant or related based on the description. Next up, based on the description. Next up, based on the description. Next up, creating a CVE. This is cool because creating a CVE. This is cool because creating a CVE. This is cool because remember it's contextual. You asked it a remember it's contextual. You asked it a remember it's contextual. You asked it a bunch of questions. You asked it to bunch of questions. You asked it to bunch of questions. You asked it to score a description. You asked it for a score a description. You asked it for a score a description. You asked it for a CWE. You can use that information CWE. You can use that information CWE. You can use that information because it's already remembered to say, because it's already remembered to say, because it's already remembered to say, "Can you draft a CVE for me?" "Can you draft a CVE for me?" "Can you draft a CVE for me?" it might be able to give you enough it might be able to give you enough it might be able to give you enough info, but a lot of the times it'll say info, but a lot of the times it'll say info, but a lot of the times it'll say you don't have enough information to to you don't have enough information to to you don't have enough information to to write the draft. These are the write the draft. These are the write the draft. These are the attributes you're missing. So, it'll attributes you're missing. So, it'll attributes you're missing. So, it'll helps you write and draft your CVE by helps you write and draft your CVE by helps you write and draft your CVE by giving it more information so it has giving it more information so it has giving it more information so it has enough to do it. Same thing with the enough to do it. Same thing with the enough to do it. Same thing with the GHSAs. You know, you're able to use it GHSAs. You know, you're able to use it GHSAs. You know, you're able to use it contextually to grab the info that contextually to grab the info that contextually to grab the info that already was there and then you're able already was there and then you're able already was there and then you're able to ask it, you know, what am I missing? to ask it, you know, what am I missing? to ask it, you know, what am I missing? What should I improve? you know what What should I improve? you know what What should I improve? you know what kind of guidance can I have for this? kind of guidance can I have for this? kind of guidance can I have for this? And uh this right here is actually the And uh this right here is actually the And uh this right here is actually the write up from this session. So all the write up from this session. So all the write up from this session. So all the questions that I asked so far and all questions that I asked so far and all questions that I asked so far and all the slides, this is the culmination of the slides, this is the culmination of the slides, this is the culmination of it. I asked it to generate a GHSA draft it. I asked it to generate a GHSA draft it. I asked it to generate a GHSA draft out of all that info and it wrote it up out of all that info and it wrote it up out of all that info and it wrote it up for me, you know, uh references, CWES, for me, you know, uh references, CWES, for me, you know, uh references, CWES, mitigation steps, impact, all that mitigation steps, impact, all that mitigation steps, impact, all that because I gave it all the information because I gave it all the information because I gave it all the information from uh in the conversation up to that from uh in the conversation up to that from uh in the conversation up to that point. So, super cool, fast example, point. So, super cool, fast example, point. So, super cool, fast example, speedrun. Next up, open sourcing. Why speedrun. Next up, open sourcing. Why speedrun. Next up, open sourcing. Why did we open source this? Well, two did we open source this? Well, two did we open source this? Well, two reasons. One, it's not really all my reasons. One, it's not really all my reasons. One, it's not really all my work, right? Uh, I was at VCON last work, right? Uh, I was at VCON last work, right? Uh, I was at VCON last year. I'm not the only person that had year. I'm not the only person that had year. I'm not the only person that had this complaint. I sat down with a bunch this complaint. I sat down with a bunch this complaint. I sat down with a bunch of people. We all had the same problem. of people. We all had the same problem. of people. We all had the same problem. We, you know, drank and yelled about it, We, you know, drank and yelled about it, We, you know, drank and yelled about it, but I I went home and I wrote something but I I went home and I wrote something but I I went home and I wrote something about it. But I didn't leave it at that. about it. But I didn't leave it at that. about it. But I didn't leave it at that. I came back to a vulcon the next day and I came back to a vulcon the next day and I came back to a vulcon the next day and I asked people for feedback and more the I asked people for feedback and more the I asked people for feedback and more the next day and we did more examples the next day and we did more examples the next day and we did more examples the day after that. So in those four days we day after that. So in those four days we day after that. So in those four days we actually did a lot of iterative testing actually did a lot of iterative testing actually did a lot of iterative testing and updates to it to get to the point and updates to it to get to the point and updates to it to get to the point where we're able to get some usable where we're able to get some usable where we're able to get some usable information out of it. And the second information out of it. And the second information out of it. And the second reason is sharing is caring right I know reason is sharing is caring right I know reason is sharing is caring right I know this was a problem for me. I use a this was a problem for me. I use a this was a problem for me. I use a modified version of this in production modified version of this in production modified version of this in production right not the exact one because we can't right not the exact one because we can't right not the exact one because we can't issue that out but I use this uh our issue that out but I use this uh our issue that out but I use this uh our modified one. You can use this too, modified one. You can use this too, modified one. You can use this too, totally free. Grab it, build, customize. totally free. Grab it, build, customize. totally free. Grab it, build, customize. Right? This is not going to replace an Right? This is not going to replace an Right? This is not going to replace an analyst right off the bat. Right? So, in analyst right off the bat. Right? So, in analyst right off the bat. Right? So, in conclusion, uh I'd like to say that this conclusion, uh I'd like to say that this conclusion, uh I'd like to say that this represents a great step in assisting represents a great step in assisting represents a great step in assisting security advisory management like the security advisory management like the security advisory management like the whole life cycle of it.

In fact, there's a blog thing written on it fact, there's a blog thing written on it fact, there's a blog thing written on it that explains the process and there's that explains the process and there's that explains the process and there's deploy instructions, examples of deploy instructions, examples of deploy instructions, examples of outputs, all kinds of stuff on there. outputs, all kinds of stuff on there. outputs, all kinds of stuff on there. And the last thing I really want to And the last thing I really want to And the last thing I really want to reiterate is this is not a solution to reiterate is this is not a solution to reiterate is this is not a solution to replace replace replace humans. No matter what you think or your humans. No matter what you think or your humans. No matter what you think or your boss says, right? The goal of the tool boss says, right? The goal of the tool boss says, right? The goal of the tool is to make it easier for humans to find is to make it easier for humans to find is to make it easier for humans to find the information they need to make the information they need to make the information they need to make informed decisions faster. The tool informed decisions faster. The tool informed decisions faster. The tool assists in making that information assists in making that information assists in making that information retrievable in a way that is natural to retrievable in a way that is natural to retrievable in a way that is natural to use to the user through the chat use to the user through the chat use to the user through the chat interface. That is the big benefit. interface. That is the big benefit. interface. That is the big benefit. You're not asking people to read a book. You're not asking people to read a book. You're not asking people to read a book. You're not asking them to Google stuff. You're not asking them to Google stuff. You're not asking them to Google stuff. you're asking them to have a you're asking them to have a you're asking them to have a conversation and that lowers the bar to conversation and that lowers the bar to conversation and that lowers the bar to entry especially for non-technical users entry especially for non-technical users entry especially for non-technical users right so I really look forward to how right so I really look forward to how right so I really look forward to how the community adopts this um you can the community adopts this um you can the community adopts this um you can always do PRs you can fork it if you always do PRs you can fork it if you always do PRs you can fork it if you want me to work on your fork let me know want me to work on your fork let me know want me to work on your fork let me know and uh as always we'll take any and uh as always we'll take any and uh as always we'll take any questions and super super happy to uh to questions and super super happy to uh to questions and super super happy to uh to talk with you guys thanks and Does anyone want to ask the kitty Does anyone want to ask the kitty Does anyone want to ask the kitty questions? It's too cat. It's too cute questions? It's too cat. It's too cute questions? It's too cat. It's too cute of a of a of a cat. Oh. Um, do you need microphone or cat. Oh. Um, do you need microphone or cat. Oh. Um, do you need microphone or Oh, wow. You're way over there. Oh, wow. You're way over there. Oh, wow. You're way over there. It can I can I go? I got you. Yeah. Um, It can I can I go? I got you. Yeah. Um, It can I can I go? I got you. Yeah. Um, what colors does it come in? What what colors does it come in? What what colors does it come in? What colors? Yeah. Uh, all colors. One of the colors? Yeah. Uh, all colors. One of the colors? Yeah. Uh, all colors. One of the cool parts about the uh the chatbot with cool parts about the uh the chatbot with cool parts about the uh the chatbot with Streamlight is that I can do fuchsia, Streamlight is that I can do fuchsia, Streamlight is that I can do fuchsia, rainbow, or salmon. More seriously, um I rainbow, or salmon. More seriously, um I rainbow, or salmon. More seriously, um I love the idea of lowering the love the idea of lowering the love the idea of lowering the psychological safety sort of barrier for psychological safety sort of barrier for psychological safety sort of barrier for for for newbie analysts. for for newbie analysts. for for newbie analysts. Um, is it currently possible to sort of Um, is it currently possible to sort of Um, is it currently possible to sort of have it in a group chat environment have it in a group chat environment have it in a group chat environment where you can sort of catch it saying where you can sort of catch it saying where you can sort of catch it saying silly things to your newbie analysts so silly things to your newbie analysts so silly things to your newbie analysts so that it's not the blind leading the that it's not the blind leading the that it's not the blind leading the blind? So, you control the target of blind? So, you control the target of blind? So, you control the target of output. Right now, it the target of output. Right now, it the target of output. Right now, it the target of output and input is the Streamlight app output and input is the Streamlight app output and input is the Streamlight app or in the Esquire version, it's in the or in the Esquire version, it's in the or in the Esquire version, it's in the Jupyter notebook. However, you could do Jupyter notebook. However, you could do Jupyter notebook. However, you could do a Slack bot if you wanted to and a Slack bot if you wanted to and a Slack bot if you wanted to and basically have like or whatever chat basically have like or whatever chat basically have like or whatever chat thing you like um and basically have it thing you like um and basically have it thing you like um and basically have it work there because really what matters work there because really what matters work there because really what matters is the context and when you start a new is the context and when you start a new is the context and when you start a new conversation with it. That's what conversation with it. That's what conversation with it. That's what matters and how you're going to store matters and how you're going to store matters and how you're going to store your conversation. Outside of that, your conversation. Outside of that, your conversation. Outside of that, whatever frontend or interaction you whatever frontend or interaction you whatever frontend or interaction you want, totally possible with it. want, totally possible with it. want, totally possible with it. Plug-andplay. Plug-andplay. Plug-andplay. Yes. Can you hear me? Okay. Yes. Thank you Can you hear me? Okay. Yes. Thank you Can you hear me? Okay. Yes. Thank you Ryan for great conversation and Ryan for great conversation and Ryan for great conversation and presentation and I have two questions presentation and I have two questions presentation and I have two questions actually. Um the first one when you talk actually. Um the first one when you talk actually. Um the first one when you talk about like better fine-tuning are you uh about like better fine-tuning are you uh about like better fine-tuning are you uh saying that uh we have to do post saying that uh we have to do post saying that uh we have to do post training maybe with some reinforcement training maybe with some reinforcement training maybe with some reinforcement learning with the input from the user or learning with the input from the user or learning with the input from the user or it's a better prompt engineering. So um it's a better prompt engineering. So um it's a better prompt engineering. So um actually both. So it depends where your actually both. So it depends where your actually both. So it depends where your problem is. So, one of the cool things problem is. So, one of the cool things problem is. So, one of the cool things about this is it does use Amazon Bedrock about this is it does use Amazon Bedrock about this is it does use Amazon Bedrock and Amazon Bedrock has a feature where and Amazon Bedrock has a feature where and Amazon Bedrock has a feature where you can record all the inputed prompts. you can record all the inputed prompts. you can record all the inputed prompts. So, one of the cool things that I did is So, one of the cool things that I did is So, one of the cool things that I did is because it's company property and we because it's company property and we because it's company property and we don't have to worry about privacy for don't have to worry about privacy for don't have to worry about privacy for our internal stuff uh of this uh what's our internal stuff uh of this uh what's our internal stuff uh of this uh what's cool is I get to analyze all the prompts cool is I get to analyze all the prompts cool is I get to analyze all the prompts and then I figure out what are common and then I figure out what are common and then I figure out what are common misconceptions from users and I can give misconceptions from users and I can give misconceptions from users and I can give them some training um to you know ask them some training um to you know ask them some training um to you know ask better pro better questions but also better pro better questions but also better pro better questions but also part of the iterative cycle that we did part of the iterative cycle that we did part of the iterative cycle that we did was tuning the prompt. Um, the prompt is was tuning the prompt. Um, the prompt is was tuning the prompt. Um, the prompt is a generic security analyst right now a generic security analyst right now a generic security analyst right now that is meant to ask general questions, that is meant to ask general questions, that is meant to ask general questions, has a list of additional common has a list of additional common has a list of additional common questions and some data. But for your questions and some data. But for your questions and some data. But for your use case, you'll you'll want to look use case, you'll you'll want to look use case, you'll you'll want to look through like when you're doing scoring, through like when you're doing scoring, through like when you're doing scoring, what are your most common questions and what are your most common questions and what are your most common questions and what are the most common outputs that what are the most common outputs that what are the most common outputs that you care about? Just tack that on to the you care about? Just tack that on to the you care about? Just tack that on to the prompt and you'll be able to get that prompt and you'll be able to get that prompt and you'll be able to get that additional context out of it and it'll additional context out of it and it'll additional context out of it and it'll require some tuning, but it's mostly require some tuning, but it's mostly require some tuning, but it's mostly prompt engineering at that point. All prompt engineering at that point. All prompt engineering at that point. All right. So actually all the techniques right. So actually all the techniques right. So actually all the techniques works just well right in the direction. works just well right in the direction. works just well right in the direction. Thank you. And the last question the Thank you. And the last question the Thank you. And the last question the second question um do you see that some second question um do you see that some second question um do you see that some models are better in this CV CWE models are better in this CV CWE models are better in this CV CWE composition over like maybe llama or clo composition over like maybe llama or clo composition over like maybe llama or clo do you have some examples and do you have some examples and do you have some examples and suggestions which models better on this suggestions which models better on this suggestions which models better on this uh vulnerability matching? Thank you. I uh vulnerability matching? Thank you. I uh vulnerability matching? Thank you. I I can say officially some models are I can say officially some models are I can say officially some models are better than others. I I can not better than others. I I can not better than others. I I can not officially say which ones because as an officially say which ones because as an officially say which ones because as an employee I can only use certain ones. So employee I can only use certain ones. So employee I can only use certain ones. So this was all built using uh Amazon this was all built using uh Amazon this was all built using uh Amazon approved LLM solutions internally. So approved LLM solutions internally. So approved LLM solutions internally. So this was claude for this one. I think we had some more questions in I think we had some more questions in I think we had some more questions in the room but please try to catch up with the room but please try to catch up with the room but please try to catch up with Ryan after the talk because we got to Ryan after the talk because we got to Ryan after the talk because we got to start getting the next folks in here.
