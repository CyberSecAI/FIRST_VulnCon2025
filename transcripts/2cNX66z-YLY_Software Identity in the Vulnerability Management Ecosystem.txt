Kind: captions Language: en Um my name is Alex Hmers. I'm MITER CVE Um my name is Alex Hmers. I'm MITER CVE Um my name is Alex Hmers. I'm MITER CVE and CW project lead. Uh I said all these and CW project lead. Uh I said all these and CW project lead. Uh I said all these things. So we've assembled a wonderful things. So we've assembled a wonderful things. So we've assembled a wonderful panel. Um I want to start this panel panel. Um I want to start this panel panel. Um I want to start this panel though with two assertions sort of to though with two assertions sort of to though with two assertions sort of to ground our discussion. Um, effective and ground our discussion. Um, effective and ground our discussion. Um, effective and efficient vulnerability management efficient vulnerability management efficient vulnerability management requires software to be trackable in a requires software to be trackable in a requires software to be trackable in a way that allows correlation with other way that allows correlation with other way that allows correlation with other information such as known information such as known information such as known vulnerabilities, mitigations for those vulnerabilities, mitigations for those vulnerabilities, mitigations for those vulnerabilities, um, for example, vulnerabilities, um, for example, vulnerabilities, um, for example, available patches, lists of approved or available patches, lists of approved or available patches, lists of approved or disallowed software, adversary disallowed software, adversary disallowed software, adversary activities, lots of different reasons. activities, lots of different reasons. activities, lots of different reasons. And there currently exists and will And there currently exists and will And there currently exists and will likely continue to exist a likely continue to exist a likely continue to exist a multi-identifier ecosystem where no multi-identifier ecosystem where no multi-identifier ecosystem where no single identifier fully addresses every single identifier fully addresses every single identifier fully addresses every software identity use case and software identity use case and software identity use case and challenge. So that's what I'm sort of challenge. So that's what I'm sort of challenge. So that's what I'm sort of positing as our level set. You can positing as our level set. You can positing as our level set. You can certainly challenge that in questions certainly challenge that in questions certainly challenge that in questions and thoughts but I thought that might be and thoughts but I thought that might be and thoughts but I thought that might be useful. So introducing our panelists we useful. So introducing our panelists we useful. So introducing our panelists we have oh I need I need two resources for have oh I need I need two resources for have oh I need I need two resources for this. Apologies. Okay. Um so firstly this.

Uh Andrew on the far end uh is a principal Andrew on the far end uh is a principal Andrew on the far end uh is a principal engineer at MITER and a core team member engineer at MITER and a core team member engineer at MITER and a core team member of the Omniore project, a promising new of the Omniore project, a promising new of the Omniore project, a promising new software identification scheme software identification scheme software identification scheme emphasizing providence and supply chain emphasizing providence and supply chain emphasizing providence and supply chain integrity. And I think I got everybody. integrity. And I think I got everybody. integrity. And I think I got everybody. Excellent. So, let's go ahead and get Excellent. So, let's go ahead and get Excellent. So, let's go ahead and get started. started. started. Sorry, had a couple resources there to Sorry, had a couple resources there to Sorry, had a couple resources there to read. So, just to kick things off, I'd read. So, just to kick things off, I'd read. So, just to kick things off, I'd like to turn the first uh question uh like to turn the first uh question uh like to turn the first uh question uh over to Megazone. Um the CVE quality over to Megazone. Um the CVE quality over to Megazone. Um the CVE quality working group has actively explored working group has actively explored working group has actively explored integrating identifiers into the CVE integrating identifiers into the CVE integrating identifiers into the CVE record format. Um recently, uh started record format. Um recently, uh started record format. Um recently, uh started supporting supporting supporting CPE. Um can you provide an update on CPE. Um can you provide an update on CPE. Um can you provide an update on what has been done thus far sort of the what has been done thus far sort of the what has been done thus far sort of the state of integration efforts and why it state of integration efforts and why it state of integration efforts and why it matters and perhaps touch on some of the matters and perhaps touch on some of the matters and perhaps touch on some of the lessons learned that we had uh in lessons learned that we had uh in lessons learned that we had uh in getting to that state with CPE. Okay. Um getting to that state with CPE. Okay. Um getting to that state with CPE. Okay. Um right so within the past year the last right so within the past year the last right so within the past year the last real schema update or the CVE record real schema update or the CVE record real schema update or the CVE record format as it's officially called update format as it's officially called update format as it's officially called update uh added I will say actual support for uh added I will say actual support for uh added I will say actual support for CPE. Technically CP was supported before CPE. Technically CP was supported before CPE. Technically CP was supported before that but it was like just an array of that but it was like just an array of that but it was like just an array of values and it was not useful. Uh because values and it was not useful. Uh because values and it was not useful. Uh because what it turned out was people were what it turned out was people were what it turned out was people were putting values in there. It was an array putting values in there. It was an array putting values in there. It was an array of values. Were these the affected of values. Were these the affected of values. Were these the affected values or the unaffected values or what values or the unaffected values or what values or the unaffected values or what did it mean? And there was no no way of did it mean? And there was no no way of did it mean? And there was no no way of telling and it was actually being used telling and it was actually being used telling and it was actually being used every possible way you can you could see every possible way you can you could see every possible way you can you could see someone using an array of values. It was someone using an array of values. It was someone using an array of values. It was being used which meant it was useless being used which meant it was useless being used which meant it was useless data if you were consuming it. Uh so we data if you were consuming it. Uh so we data if you were consuming it. Uh so we actually put in real CPE support using actually put in real CPE support using actually put in real CPE support using NVD uh spec that they've been using for NVD uh spec that they've been using for NVD uh spec that they've been using for a long time. So it's basically directly a long time. So it's basically directly a long time. So it's basically directly compatible. I think there was a field compatible. I think there was a field compatible. I think there was a field name change we had to make because we name change we had to make because we name change we had to make because we already had a field using the same name already had a field using the same name already had a field using the same name that they were using per field. Uh but that they were using per field. Uh but that they were using per field. Uh but now you could basically take the data in now you could basically take the data in now you could basically take the data in the CV record uh like Microsoft Red Hat the CV record uh like Microsoft Red Hat the CV record uh like Microsoft Red Hat are providing CPEs uh and it's in the are providing CPEs uh and it's in the are providing CPEs uh and it's in the same format that NVD has launched same format that NVD has launched same format that NVD has launched providing it. Uh so it's easy for people providing it. Uh so it's easy for people providing it. Uh so it's easy for people who are consuming it before to consume who are consuming it before to consume who are consuming it before to consume it from the CV records. The quality it from the CV records. The quality it from the CV records. The quality working group right now is working on working group right now is working on working group right now is working on there's a poll request you opened I there's a poll request you opened I there's a poll request you opened I think right for for uh pearl purl for think right for for uh pearl purl for think right for for uh pearl purl for the people who think p when they hear the people who think p when they hear the people who think p when they hear pearl um the pearl for identifiers and pearl um the pearl for identifiers and pearl um the pearl for identifiers and omnibore we're both looking at both of omnibore we're both looking at both of omnibore we're both looking at both of those I think pearl right now is a those I think pearl right now is a those I think pearl right now is a little farther along in the discussion little farther along in the discussion little farther along in the discussion uh but the idea right now we have is the uh but the idea right now we have is the uh but the idea right now we have is the quality working group from CVE is our quality working group from CVE is our quality working group from CVE is our job is not to solve the unified software job is not to solve the unified software job is not to solve the unified software for identifier problem. Uh it's to for identifier problem. Uh it's to for identifier problem. Uh it's to support what the industry that's got support what the industry that's got support what the industry that's got better to to support what the industry better to to support what the industry better to to support what the industry is using. Uh and right now what we're is using. Uh and right now what we're is using. Uh and right now what we're seeing is you know CP this large support seeing is you know CP this large support seeing is you know CP this large support for CP is a large group over here that for CP is a large group over here that for CP is a large group over here that uses Pearl. They don't necessarily talk uses Pearl. They don't necessarily talk uses Pearl. They don't necessarily talk to each other. Uh and there's other to each other. Uh and there's other to each other. Uh and there's other identifiers that we're open to identifiers that we're open to identifiers that we're open to considering other identifiers to support considering other identifiers to support considering other identifiers to support the industry. the industry. the industry. Thank you. So sticking with where we are Thank you. So sticking with where we are Thank you. So sticking with where we are or were I'd like to say the next or were I'd like to say the next or were I'd like to say the next question to Chris. um for your vantage question to Chris. um for your vantage question to Chris. um for your vantage point at NVD point at NVD point at NVD um could you share your perspective on um could you share your perspective on um could you share your perspective on CPE's current strengths and its CPE's current strengths and its CPE's current strengths and its challenges offer your perspective on the challenges offer your perspective on the challenges offer your perspective on the state of uh both CPE and software state of uh both CPE and software state of uh both CPE and software identifiers in the ecosystem. identifiers in the ecosystem. identifiers in the ecosystem. Okay. Uh all right Okay. Uh all right Okay. Uh all right so that is a wide question. Uh so the uh so that is a wide question. Uh so the uh so that is a wide question. Uh so the uh for CPE strengths and its challenges um for CPE strengths and its challenges um for CPE strengths and its challenges um so for what it's worth CPE does do so for what it's worth CPE does do so for what it's worth CPE does do identification to an extent uh that uh identification to an extent uh that uh identification to an extent uh that uh covers most bases. Uh there are covers most bases. Uh there are covers most bases. Uh there are absolutely challenges when it comes to absolutely challenges when it comes to absolutely challenges when it comes to uh both scaling the operation of CPE uh uh both scaling the operation of CPE uh uh both scaling the operation of CPE uh both because of all sorts of concerns both because of all sorts of concerns both because of all sorts of concerns with you know versioning schemes and with you know versioning schemes and with you know versioning schemes and things of that nature but also things of that nature but also things of that nature but also acquisitions and other things when acquisitions and other things when acquisitions and other things when you're trying to approach the um uh you're trying to approach the um uh you're trying to approach the um uh establishing the attributes in a more establishing the attributes in a more establishing the attributes in a more consolidated way. Um I think that covers consolidated way. Um I think that covers consolidated way. Um I think that covers most of the the initial concerns people most of the the initial concerns people most of the the initial concerns people have with CPE. Um, secondarily from uh have with CPE. Um, secondarily from uh have with CPE. Um, secondarily from uh from my perspective, one of the one of from my perspective, one of the one of from my perspective, one of the one of the real hard things about CP has the real hard things about CP has the real hard things about CP has actually been in uh scaling the ability actually been in uh scaling the ability actually been in uh scaling the ability to create the applicability statements to create the applicability statements to create the applicability statements uh across the wide range of uh across the wide range of uh across the wide range of vulnerability records that exist today. vulnerability records that exist today. vulnerability records that exist today. Um, some of that comes from the Um, some of that comes from the Um, some of that comes from the difficulty in difficulty in difficulty in um, being able to list off all of the um, being able to list off all of the um, being able to list off all of the instances of a specific product. Uh, instances of a specific product. Uh, instances of a specific product. Uh, because that could be one, maybe two because that could be one, maybe two because that could be one, maybe two things, or for large products and things, or for large products and things, or for large products and something that's been around for a long something that's been around for a long something that's been around for a long time, it could be tens of thousands of time, it could be tens of thousands of time, it could be tens of thousands of different uh, identifiers that need to different uh, identifiers that need to different uh, identifiers that need to be tracked. be tracked. be tracked. um CPE applicability, the uh the thing um CPE applicability, the uh the thing um CPE applicability, the uh the thing that was just added to the CVE record uh that was just added to the CVE record uh that was just added to the CVE record uh format is a nice way of trying to reduce format is a nice way of trying to reduce format is a nice way of trying to reduce the level of effort that it takes with the level of effort that it takes with the level of effort that it takes with that challenge by allowing sort of a that challenge by allowing sort of a that challenge by allowing sort of a shorthand for creating matches between shorthand for creating matches between shorthand for creating matches between the applicability language and the uh the applicability language and the uh the applicability language and the uh CPE names that exist in the dictionary. CPE names that exist in the dictionary. CPE names that exist in the dictionary. However, uh even that at scale, uh still However, uh even that at scale, uh still However, uh even that at scale, uh still has challenges with being able to to get has challenges with being able to to get has challenges with being able to to get the information together accurately and the information together accurately and the information together accurately and uh timely. Um so I I guess just to go uh timely. Um so I I guess just to go uh timely. Um so I I guess just to go for one of the main challenges there is for one of the main challenges there is for one of the main challenges there is is finding a way to kind of uh increase is finding a way to kind of uh increase is finding a way to kind of uh increase the amount of uh contributions that are the amount of uh contributions that are the amount of uh contributions that are coming from authoritative sources for coming from authoritative sources for coming from authoritative sources for what the appropriate uh applicability what the appropriate uh applicability what the appropriate uh applicability statements may or may not be. which is statements may or may not be. which is statements may or may not be. which is one of the reasons it was so uh one of the reasons it was so uh one of the reasons it was so uh important to be able to get the important to be able to get the important to be able to get the applicability language into the CVE applicability language into the CVE applicability language into the CVE record format. Uh that essentially is record format. Uh that essentially is record format. Uh that essentially is the first step to really allowing CNAs the first step to really allowing CNAs the first step to really allowing CNAs and other participants within the CVE and other participants within the CVE and other participants within the CVE program to start providing that program to start providing that program to start providing that information in a much more direct and information in a much more direct and information in a much more direct and actionable way. Thanks Chris. Yeah, I actionable way. Thanks Chris. Yeah, I actionable way. Thanks Chris. Yeah, I might take that opportunity too to flag might take that opportunity too to flag might take that opportunity too to flag for the audience that there is a CPE for the audience that there is a CPE for the audience that there is a CPE sort of uh workshop in the afternoon I sort of uh workshop in the afternoon I sort of uh workshop in the afternoon I think today uh which really goes through think today uh which really goes through think today uh which really goes through the initial uh user guide that was the initial uh user guide that was the initial uh user guide that was published uh to help CNAs do that published uh to help CNAs do that published uh to help CNAs do that better. Um we are seeing some start to better. Um we are seeing some start to better. Um we are seeing some start to provide CPEs in the data as part of the provide CPEs in the data as part of the provide CPEs in the data as part of the CVE record but we encourage more and we CVE record but we encourage more and we CVE record but we encourage more and we hope for more. So that is there if hope for more. So that is there if hope for more. So that is there if you're interested in doing it. Um Steve you're interested in doing it. Um Steve you're interested in doing it. Um Steve turning to you we can see you on screen turning to you we can see you on screen turning to you we can see you on screen now. Hello sir it's nice awesome. So um now. Hello sir it's nice awesome. So um now. Hello sir it's nice awesome. So um package URL has emerged as a practical package URL has emerged as a practical package URL has emerged as a practical uh and decentralized approach to uh and decentralized approach to uh and decentralized approach to software identification. Could you uh software identification. Could you uh software identification. Could you uh for the audience could you please for the audience could you please for the audience could you please briefly outline its origins, its briefly outline its origins, its briefly outline its origins, its development, what role it's playing development, what role it's playing development, what role it's playing today? today? today? Yeah know great question. So um I think Yeah know great question. So um I think Yeah know great question. So um I think a a key distinction that you made there a a key distinction that you made there a a key distinction that you made there is that the fact that it is is that the fact that it is is that the fact that it is decentralized which is the opposite of decentralized which is the opposite of decentralized which is the opposite of of CPEs with the CPE dictionary today. of CPEs with the CPE dictionary today. of CPEs with the CPE dictionary today. Um it started life uh Philip Omdan um Um it started life uh Philip Omdan um Um it started life uh Philip Omdan um started the specification I believe in started the specification I believe in started the specification I believe in 2016 2017 something along those lines 2016 2017 something along those lines 2016 2017 something along those lines and it has evolved from an idea on a and it has evolved from an idea on a and it has evolved from an idea on a napkin to essentially one of the most um napkin to essentially one of the most um napkin to essentially one of the most um used software identifiers on the planet used software identifiers on the planet used software identifiers on the planet today. Um because of its decentralized today. Um because of its decentralized today. Um because of its decentralized nature, it naturally integrates with any nature, it naturally integrates with any nature, it naturally integrates with any kind of package managing uh package kind of package managing uh package kind of package managing uh package manager today. Uh package managers being manager today. Uh package managers being manager today. Uh package managers being tools that developers use to manage tools that developers use to manage tools that developers use to manage their software dependencies uh Python, their software dependencies uh Python, their software dependencies uh Python, npm, Java, etc. npm, Java, etc. npm, Java, etc. uh Pearl in its decentralized state uh Pearl in its decentralized state uh Pearl in its decentralized state naturally uses the name and versioning naturally uses the name and versioning naturally uses the name and versioning from all of these different u package from all of these different u package from all of these different u package managers which makes it essentially managers which makes it essentially managers which makes it essentially compatible with all existing software. compatible with all existing software. compatible with all existing software. Um it also means that you reduce the Um it also means that you reduce the Um it also means that you reduce the human out of the loop in terms of giving human out of the loop in terms of giving human out of the loop in terms of giving it a name. Um the name is created by the it a name. Um the name is created by the it a name. Um the name is created by the developers using their package managers, developers using their package managers, developers using their package managers, right? using the the the publishing right? using the the the publishing right? using the the the publishing mechanisms that already exist mechanisms that already exist mechanisms that already exist today. Um its current state is that it today. Um its current state is that it today. Um its current state is that it is um because most packages are in fact is um because most packages are in fact is um because most packages are in fact open source, it is primarily used um or open source, it is primarily used um or open source, it is primarily used um or seen as a specification that is solely seen as a specification that is solely seen as a specification that is solely for open source. But that couldn't be for open source. But that couldn't be for open source. But that couldn't be further from the truth. Um commercial further from the truth. Um commercial further from the truth. Um commercial packages are a thing. uh and in fact we packages are a thing. uh and in fact we packages are a thing. uh and in fact we are working on multiple pearl types that are working on multiple pearl types that are working on multiple pearl types that uh would allow us to um identify uh would allow us to um identify uh would allow us to um identify software components in different software components in different software components in different commercial uh stores. Um its current commercial uh stores. Um its current commercial uh stores. Um its current state is that it is um it's state is that it is um it's state is that it is um it's stable. It is um extensible um pearl stable. It is um extensible um pearl stable. It is um extensible um pearl types. You can define your own types uh types. You can define your own types uh types. You can define your own types uh for things that may not exist today. and for things that may not exist today. and for things that may not exist today. and it is going to um uh go through the ECMA it is going to um uh go through the ECMA it is going to um uh go through the ECMA standardization process later this year. standardization process later this year. standardization process later this year. And fingers crossed we are hopeful that And fingers crossed we are hopeful that And fingers crossed we are hopeful that it'll become an international standard it'll become an international standard it'll become an international standard at the Geneva um uh general assembly at the Geneva um uh general assembly at the Geneva um uh general assembly meeting in December of this year. meeting in December of this year. meeting in December of this year. Thank you, Steve. Um I was just notified Thank you, Steve. Um I was just notified Thank you, Steve. Um I was just notified there's a number of questions online there's a number of questions online there's a number of questions online that are coming in. We will get to all that are coming in. We will get to all that are coming in. We will get to all your questions. So no worries. I just your questions. So no worries. I just your questions. So no worries. I just want to make sure we get through all the want to make sure we get through all the want to make sure we get through all the planned discussion topic points. So planned discussion topic points. So planned discussion topic points. So thank you Steve. Um Andrew Omniorore thank you Steve. Um Andrew Omniorore thank you Steve. Um Andrew Omniorore uh approaches software identification a uh approaches software identification a uh approaches software identification a little differently. Um is probably little differently. Um is probably little differently. Um is probably fairly assumed to be said uh less well fairly assumed to be said uh less well fairly assumed to be said uh less well known than CPE and Pearl. Could you known than CPE and Pearl. Could you known than CPE and Pearl. Could you briefly describe what sets Omnibore briefly describe what sets Omnibore briefly describe what sets Omnibore apart and its current development state? apart and its current development state? apart and its current development state? Sure. Yes. So uh for anyone who's Sure. Yes. So uh for anyone who's Sure. Yes. So uh for anyone who's unfamiliar uh omnibore is uh a scheme unfamiliar uh omnibore is uh a scheme unfamiliar uh omnibore is uh a scheme for software identity that I'll I'll say for software identity that I'll I'll say for software identity that I'll I'll say its central distinction from CPE or its central distinction from CPE or its central distinction from CPE or Pearl is that it's an inherent Pearl is that it's an inherent Pearl is that it's an inherent identifier. So rather than being based identifier. So rather than being based identifier. So rather than being based on some uh so with Pearl sorry with CPE on some uh so with Pearl sorry with CPE on some uh so with Pearl sorry with CPE you have the central dictionary with you have the central dictionary with you have the central dictionary with Pearl you have the Pearl types list Pearl you have the Pearl types list Pearl you have the Pearl types list which is maintained by the Pearl project which is maintained by the Pearl project which is maintained by the Pearl project and basically describes all of the and basically describes all of the and basically describes all of the different package hosts. So both of different package hosts. So both of different package hosts. So both of those in some way are defined. They rely those in some way are defined. They rely those in some way are defined. They rely on some central definitions. Uh omnibore on some central definitions. Uh omnibore on some central definitions. Uh omnibore artifact ids don't they are inherent artifact ids don't they are inherent artifact ids don't they are inherent identifiers derived only from the identifiers derived only from the identifiers derived only from the artifact that is being identified. The artifact that is being identified. The artifact that is being identified. The other thing is that that granularity other thing is that that granularity other thing is that that granularity omnibore artifact IDs in the name omnibore artifact IDs in the name omnibore artifact IDs in the name therefore identifying artifacts. They're therefore identifying artifacts. They're therefore identifying artifacts. They're identifying binaries or source files identifying binaries or source files identifying binaries or source files like you're identifying very concrete like you're identifying very concrete like you're identifying very concrete things rather than uh with package URLs. things rather than uh with package URLs. things rather than uh with package URLs. you're identifying packages. CPE usual you're identifying packages. CPE usual you're identifying packages. CPE usual phrase I've heard or used has been that phrase I've heard or used has been that phrase I've heard or used has been that you're identifying products and these you're identifying products and these you're identifying products and these things can be complimentary to each things can be complimentary to each things can be complimentary to each other but this is the way that omnibore other but this is the way that omnibore other but this is the way that omnibore being an inherent identifier being an inherent identifier being an inherent identifier specifically for artifacts that it is um specifically for artifacts that it is um specifically for artifacts that it is um distinguished as far as the current distinguished as far as the current distinguished as far as the current state of its development. So we have a state of its development. So we have a state of its development. So we have a uh specification which is open and uh specification which is open and uh specification which is open and public. We have reference public. We have reference public. We have reference implementation. um it's starting to gain implementation. um it's starting to gain implementation. um it's starting to gain adoption, but it is still, I would say, adoption, but it is still, I would say, adoption, but it is still, I would say, the the newest and least used of the the the newest and least used of the the the newest and least used of the schemes that's um being discussed here. schemes that's um being discussed here. schemes that's um being discussed here. Thank you, Edger. So, I'd like to Thank you, Edger. So, I'd like to Thank you, Edger. So, I'd like to actually hammer home a couple of points. actually hammer home a couple of points. actually hammer home a couple of points. So, one, could you just give a clear So, one, could you just give a clear So, one, could you just give a clear another explanation of sort of these two another explanation of sort of these two another explanation of sort of these two points because I want to and I'm going points because I want to and I'm going points because I want to and I'm going to follow up, Steve, if you can do a to follow up, Steve, if you can do a to follow up, Steve, if you can do a quick followup on decentralized versus quick followup on decentralized versus quick followup on decentralized versus centralized, but inherent versus uh centralized, but inherent versus uh centralized, but inherent versus uh defined. Could you do that one? Yeah. defined. Could you do that one? Yeah. defined. Could you do that one? Yeah. Because this is really important for the Because this is really important for the Because this is really important for the further questions, I think. Yeah. Yeah. further questions, I think. Yeah. Yeah. further questions, I think. Yeah. Yeah. So uh at the toward the end of 2023, So uh at the toward the end of 2023, So uh at the toward the end of 2023, SISA published a paper that was the SISA published a paper that was the SISA published a paper that was the software identification ecosystem option software identification ecosystem option software identification ecosystem option analysis, which is a bit of a mouthful analysis, which is a bit of a mouthful analysis, which is a bit of a mouthful of a title, but basically is an overview of a title, but basically is an overview of a title, but basically is an overview of different identifier schemes. And of different identifier schemes. And of different identifier schemes. And they put forward this taxonomy of they put forward this taxonomy of they put forward this taxonomy of defined versus inherent identifiers. defined versus inherent identifiers. defined versus inherent identifiers. Defined identifiers rely on some central Defined identifiers rely on some central Defined identifiers rely on some central taxonomy, some central list. Um and then taxonomy, some central list. Um and then taxonomy, some central list. Um and then inherent identifiers are based only on inherent identifiers are based only on inherent identifiers are based only on the thing that is being identified. Um, the thing that is being identified. Um, the thing that is being identified. Um, to put it in another way, you might say to put it in another way, you might say to put it in another way, you might say that there's centralized, where the that there's centralized, where the that there's centralized, where the whole production of identifiers goes whole production of identifiers goes whole production of identifiers goes through a central place, which is really through a central place, which is really through a central place, which is really sort of the the CPE dictionary really sort of the the CPE dictionary really sort of the the CPE dictionary really controls what is allowed to be placed controls what is allowed to be placed controls what is allowed to be placed into values for CPE. Um, whereas you into values for CPE. Um, whereas you into values for CPE. Um, whereas you might say that Pearl is federated might say that Pearl is federated might say that Pearl is federated because it does have the single central because it does have the single central because it does have the single central list of types, but then has the sort of list of types, but then has the sort of list of types, but then has the sort of federates the identity of individual federates the identity of individual federates the identity of individual packages to each of the package hosts packages to each of the package hosts packages to each of the package hosts that are in the system. And then that are in the system. And then that are in the system. And then omnibore is completely distributed omnibore is completely distributed omnibore is completely distributed because anyone can produce an because anyone can produce an because anyone can produce an identifiers and will produce the same identifiers and will produce the same identifiers and will produce the same identifier for any particular artifact. identifier for any particular artifact. identifier for any particular artifact. All right. Thanks. I think you sort of All right. Thanks. I think you sort of All right. Thanks. I think you sort of covered the centralized part, but Steve, covered the centralized part, but Steve, covered the centralized part, but Steve, is there anything to add there for is there anything to add there for is there anything to add there for centralized versus decentralized? No, I centralized versus decentralized? No, I centralized versus decentralized? No, I I think that's an accurate I think that's an accurate I think that's an accurate representation. Um, you know, I I kind representation. Um, you know, I I kind representation. Um, you know, I I kind of look at the identifiers from a um of look at the identifiers from a um of look at the identifiers from a um from a funnel perspective. At the very from a funnel perspective. At the very from a funnel perspective. At the very top of the funnel, you you have CPE, top of the funnel, you you have CPE, top of the funnel, you you have CPE, where it's it's kind of a broad where it's it's kind of a broad where it's it's kind of a broad identifier in a sense. And in the middle identifier in a sense. And in the middle identifier in a sense. And in the middle of that funnel, you have Pearl, which is of that funnel, you have Pearl, which is of that funnel, you have Pearl, which is where I think most people want to be. where I think most people want to be. where I think most people want to be. But if you want precision, right, that's But if you want precision, right, that's But if you want precision, right, that's at the very bottom of the of the funnel, at the very bottom of the of the funnel, at the very bottom of the of the funnel, and that's where Omnibore's strengths, I and that's where Omnibore's strengths, I and that's where Omnibore's strengths, I think, really re uh really really shine. think, really re uh really really shine. think, really re uh really really shine. Thanks, Steve. All right. So, um, at Thanks, Steve. All right. So, um, at Thanks, Steve. All right. So, um, at this time, I'd like to sort of open up this time, I'd like to sort of open up this time, I'd like to sort of open up the floor, so to speak, for those in the floor, so to speak, for those in the floor, so to speak, for those in attendance and also for those online. I attendance and also for those online. I attendance and also for those online. I know we have several questions. So, uh, know we have several questions. So, uh, know we have several questions. So, uh, if you do have a question, please raise if you do have a question, please raise if you do have a question, please raise your hand, and I think the the your hand, and I think the the your hand, and I think the the microphone will be brought to you. Um, microphone will be brought to you. Um, microphone will be brought to you. Um, let's try and sort of balance back and let's try and sort of balance back and let's try and sort of balance back and forth, uh, maybe online and in person. forth, uh, maybe online and in person. forth, uh, maybe online and in person. So, Jay, go ahead. Um, yeah, Alec, at So, Jay, go ahead. Um, yeah, Alec, at So, Jay, go ahead. Um, yeah, Alec, at the beginning, you said that, uh, I the beginning, you said that, uh, I the beginning, you said that, uh, I can't remember how you worded it, but can't remember how you worded it, but can't remember how you worded it, but that proper software identification is that proper software identification is that proper software identification is required for a bunch of stuff. Uh, I was required for a bunch of stuff. Uh, I was required for a bunch of stuff. Uh, I was wondering if the panelists would take wondering if the panelists would take wondering if the panelists would take some time and talk about how close are some time and talk about how close are some time and talk about how close are we to actually achieving that being it we to actually achieving that being it we to actually achieving that being it being required and that we're able to being required and that we're able to being required and that we're able to accurately identify software in the wild accurately identify software in the wild accurately identify software in the wild uh as as defenders. uh as as defenders. uh as as defenders. Yeah, I I think anybody who wants to run Yeah, I I think anybody who wants to run Yeah, I I think anybody who wants to run with that, I would say that um with that, I would say that um with that, I would say that um effective, right? And that's the target effective, right? And that's the target effective, right? And that's the target we're aiming for, right? Yeah. So, where we're aiming for, right? Yeah. So, where we're aiming for, right? Yeah. So, where are we right now? Anybody? We're getting there. Um I mean just having this conversation Um I mean just having this conversation Um I mean just having this conversation alone says that we're on the track to to alone says that we're on the track to to alone says that we're on the track to to trying to resolve the issues that we're trying to resolve the issues that we're trying to resolve the issues that we're we're trying to get to. Uh much like we're trying to get to. Uh much like we're trying to get to. Uh much like Steve mentioned, um each one of these Steve mentioned, um each one of these Steve mentioned, um each one of these different solutions kind of offers a different solutions kind of offers a different solutions kind of offers a different capability of granularity different capability of granularity different capability of granularity based off of whatever information we based off of whatever information we based off of whatever information we have available. Um, at the end of the have available. Um, at the end of the have available. Um, at the end of the day, the biggest struggle everybody in day, the biggest struggle everybody in day, the biggest struggle everybody in this room probably has, uh, is getting this room probably has, uh, is getting this room probably has, uh, is getting the information they need about the the information they need about the the information they need about the thing they need to know about when they thing they need to know about when they thing they need to know about when they need to know about it. need to know about it. need to know about it. Um, using Steve's, uh, funnel example, Um, using Steve's, uh, funnel example, Um, using Steve's, uh, funnel example, CPE was developed in a world where we CPE was developed in a world where we CPE was developed in a world where we knew we wouldn't have the information we knew we wouldn't have the information we knew we wouldn't have the information we needed. Uh, in fact, that's still the needed. Uh, in fact, that's still the needed. Uh, in fact, that's still the case today for quite a few things. Um, case today for quite a few things. Um, case today for quite a few things. Um, Pearl operates in a space primarily uh Pearl operates in a space primarily uh Pearl operates in a space primarily uh that you know lets uh where the that you know lets uh where the that you know lets uh where the information is available and you can information is available and you can information is available and you can establish the ecosystem and how that establish the ecosystem and how that establish the ecosystem and how that ecosystem works uh which is building on ecosystem works uh which is building on ecosystem works uh which is building on top of that you know information that's top of that you know information that's top of that you know information that's available and then omnivor obviously available and then omnivor obviously available and then omnivor obviously just goes straight down there. Um so I just goes straight down there. Um so I just goes straight down there. Um so I guess my answer is we're getting there guess my answer is we're getting there guess my answer is we're getting there and we're starting to accept that and we're starting to accept that and we're starting to accept that there's going to have to be a lot of there's going to have to be a lot of there's going to have to be a lot of different ways to get there until we different ways to get there until we different ways to get there until we have better mechanisms for having this have better mechanisms for having this have better mechanisms for having this information from the start. Uh and also so Megazone mentioned Uh and also so Megazone mentioned Uh and also so Megazone mentioned earlier that there's an active proposal earlier that there's an active proposal earlier that there's an active proposal for the CVE record format or actually for the CVE record format or actually for the CVE record format or actually it's right now three proposals that uh it's right now three proposals that uh it's right now three proposals that uh collectively tried to expand the options collectively tried to expand the options collectively tried to expand the options of software identifiers available in CVE of software identifiers available in CVE of software identifiers available in CVE records and I I'll say that part of that records and I I'll say that part of that records and I I'll say that part of that the design of that proposal is that you the design of that proposal is that you the design of that proposal is that you should be able to mix and match these should be able to mix and match these should be able to mix and match these different identifiers to get the sort of different identifiers to get the sort of different identifiers to get the sort of level of granularity that you need. You level of granularity that you need. You level of granularity that you need. You know, this again like to Steve's point know, this again like to Steve's point know, this again like to Steve's point that these things sort of form a funnel that these things sort of form a funnel that these things sort of form a funnel of increasing levels of granularity. of increasing levels of granularity. of increasing levels of granularity. Being able to express, you know, oh, Being able to express, you know, oh, Being able to express, you know, oh, it's this product and perhaps it's it's this product and perhaps it's it's this product and perhaps it's distributed through these different distributed through these different distributed through these different channels. You know, you might have a channels. You know, you might have a channels. You know, you might have a like let's say curl gets packaged for a like let's say curl gets packaged for a like let's say curl gets packaged for a whole bunch of different uh ecosystems whole bunch of different uh ecosystems whole bunch of different uh ecosystems and so it might have a bunch of pearls and so it might have a bunch of pearls and so it might have a bunch of pearls and then you might have um particular and then you might have um particular and then you might have um particular omnibore artifact IDs for artifacts that omnibore artifact IDs for artifacts that omnibore artifact IDs for artifacts that are distributed through each of those. are distributed through each of those. are distributed through each of those. that being able to mix and match those that being able to mix and match those that being able to mix and match those granularities gets you closer to really granularities gets you closer to really granularities gets you closer to really being able to uh have that sort of as being able to uh have that sort of as being able to uh have that sort of as precise identifi as an identification as precise identifi as an identification as precise identifi as an identification as you need. you need. you need. Yeah, I don't think there's any there's Yeah, I don't think there's any there's Yeah, I don't think there's any there's not like there's a central authority at not like there's a central authority at not like there's a central authority at least not yet. We'll see that who's come least not yet. We'll see that who's come least not yet. We'll see that who's come has come in mandated, right? It's like has come in mandated, right? It's like has come in mandated, right? It's like everyone must throw identifiers on everyone must throw identifiers on everyone must throw identifiers on everything they do. Uh I do not I will everything they do. Uh I do not I will everything they do. Uh I do not I will say see the CV organization mandating say see the CV organization mandating say see the CV organization mandating that we we're making it possible to for that we we're making it possible to for that we we're making it possible to for people to provide that information. uh people to provide that information. uh people to provide that information. uh but there's also like you said multiple but there's also like you said multiple but there's also like you said multiple choice so we're trying to make it choice so we're trying to make it choice so we're trying to make it possible that if you have an identifier possible that if you have an identifier possible that if you have an identifier you can provide that identifier uh but I you can provide that identifier uh but I you can provide that identifier uh but I think the industry is where the force is think the industry is where the force is think the industry is where the force is coming from because you're seeing coming from because you're seeing coming from because you're seeing requirements from different industries requirements from different industries requirements from different industries from the governments and like providing from the governments and like providing from the governments and like providing sbombs providing vex statements and sbombs providing vex statements and sbombs providing vex statements and identifiers become more and more identifiers become more and more identifiers become more and more important to tie these things together important to tie these things together important to tie these things together so you can like when I have a vex so you can like when I have a vex so you can like when I have a vex document what am I talking about when I document what am I talking about when I document what am I talking about when I have a when I have a cesap or whatever have a when I have a cesap or whatever have a when I have a cesap or whatever and so I think there's market forces are and so I think there's market forces are and so I think there's market forces are also helping to drive identifiers Yeah, also helping to drive identifiers Yeah, also helping to drive identifiers Yeah, Steve, do you have anything to add on Steve, do you have anything to add on Steve, do you have anything to add on that question? No, I I don't I don't I that question? No, I I don't I don't I that question? No, I I don't I don't I think a multi-identifier future is um is think a multi-identifier future is um is think a multi-identifier future is um is to be expected, right? Um historically to be expected, right? Um historically to be expected, right? Um historically vulnerability management has centered vulnerability management has centered vulnerability management has centered around CPEs and uh we all kind of know around CPEs and uh we all kind of know around CPEs and uh we all kind of know the strengths and and weaknesses of that the strengths and and weaknesses of that the strengths and and weaknesses of that identifier, but um just to kind of identifier, but um just to kind of identifier, but um just to kind of reiterate, I think a multi-identifier reiterate, I think a multi-identifier reiterate, I think a multi-identifier future is um is coming. Great. Thanks future is um is coming. Great. Thanks future is um is coming. Great. Thanks for the question, Jay. Uh any other for the question, Jay. Uh any other for the question, Jay. Uh any other questions in the room? Yes, we got one. questions in the room? Yes, we got one. questions in the room? Yes, we got one. Jerry, the Pearl, Omnivore, and CBE be Jerry, the Pearl, Omnivore, and CBE be Jerry, the Pearl, Omnivore, and CBE be required to provide data transformers to required to provide data transformers to required to provide data transformers to the other other platforms as part of the other other platforms as part of the other other platforms as part of being accepted so that someone can being accepted so that someone can being accepted so that someone can calculate the change. say you give an calculate the change. say you give an calculate the change. say you give an omnibore that they have to provide a omnibore that they have to provide a omnibore that they have to provide a formula to to recalculate that to CPE or formula to to recalculate that to CPE or formula to to recalculate that to CPE or do you see a world where these are just do you see a world where these are just do you see a world where these are just three separate silos that don't have to three separate silos that don't have to three separate silos that don't have to to interact. Oh, Oh, Oh, okay. Okay. So, just and to make sure I okay. Okay. So, just and to make sure I okay. Okay. So, just and to make sure I have the question right. So this is have the question right. So this is have the question right. So this is basically about whether people who are basically about whether people who are basically about whether people who are providing identifier data to CVE in a providing identifier data to CVE in a providing identifier data to CVE in a future where all of that is supported future where all of that is supported future where all of that is supported whether they should have to provide some whether they should have to provide some whether they should have to provide some like uh matching between like okay this like uh matching between like okay this like uh matching between like okay this omnibore is part of this package that's omnibore is part of this package that's omnibore is part of this package that's identified with a CPE like sort of identified with a CPE like sort of identified with a CPE like sort of allowing cross referencing allowing cross referencing allowing cross referencing that omnibore someone could figure out that omnibore someone could figure out that omnibore someone could figure out how to take this omnibore and change it how to take this omnibore and change it how to take this omnibore and change it to a CPE that could either be the to a CPE that could either be the to a CPE that could either be the program or it could be published program or it could be published program or it could be published somewhere because I I hear many times somewhere because I I hear many times somewhere because I I hear many times like why we're having three is because like why we're having three is because like why we're having three is because nobody uses or different use cases for nobody uses or different use cases for nobody uses or different use cases for different ones but nobody's going to be different ones but nobody's going to be different ones but nobody's going to be happy but if you said hey to be part of happy but if you said hey to be part of happy but if you said hey to be part of this data you have to provide a this data you have to provide a this data you have to provide a transformation path so that someone can transformation path so that someone can transformation path so that someone can we're not going to do it we'll give it we're not going to do it we'll give it we're not going to do it we'll give it to you in our preferred format but to you in our preferred format but to you in our preferred format but here's how you would take that and here's how you would take that and here's how you would take that and change it to a CPE or change it to a change it to a CPE or change it to a change it to a CPE or change it to a pearl or from a pearl to a CPE so that pearl or from a pearl to a CPE so that pearl or from a pearl to a CPE so that it's widely usable because if not we get it's widely usable because if not we get it's widely usable because if not we get the X KCD comic that everybody put in the X KCD comic that everybody put in the X KCD comic that everybody put in the in the Discord the in the Discord the in the Discord you know, we now have 15 standards, you know, we now have 15 standards, you know, we now have 15 standards, right? Yeah, it's definitely a right? Yeah, it's definitely a right? Yeah, it's definitely a challenging problem. Um I will say for challenging problem. Um I will say for challenging problem. Um I will say for omnibore specifically that because it's omnibore specifically that because it's omnibore specifically that because it's an inherent identifier there's a nice an inherent identifier there's a nice an inherent identifier there's a nice ability to do some of that uh just like ability to do some of that uh just like ability to do some of that uh just like from registries like for example there's from registries like for example there's from registries like for example there's a member of the omnibore core team who a member of the omnibore core team who a member of the omnibore core team who went through Maven central and produced went through Maven central and produced went through Maven central and produced basically a giant mapping of package basically a giant mapping of package basically a giant mapping of package URLs for every package to the omnibore URLs for every package to the omnibore URLs for every package to the omnibore artifact identifiers for everything in artifact identifiers for everything in artifact identifiers for everything in those packages just to you know now he those packages just to you know now he those packages just to you know now he has a little API you can cross reference has a little API you can cross reference has a little API you can cross reference and move between those two identifiers. and move between those two identifiers. and move between those two identifiers. Um I think with CPE I'm not aware of Um I think with CPE I'm not aware of Um I think with CPE I'm not aware of someone doing that particular mapping someone doing that particular mapping someone doing that particular mapping like omnibore to CPE you're back but you like omnibore to CPE you're back but you like omnibore to CPE you're back but you know I think with omnibore specifically know I think with omnibore specifically know I think with omnibore specifically like it's because it's inherent there is like it's because it's inherent there is like it's because it's inherent there is a little bit of like you can do it a little bit of like you can do it a little bit of like you can do it yourself or someone can do it and then yourself or someone can do it and then yourself or someone can do it and then just have that up and available. just have that up and available. just have that up and available. I think part of the problem is you're I think part of the problem is you're I think part of the problem is you're going to have a many to one relationship going to have a many to one relationship going to have a many to one relationship too like if you've got an omnibore too like if you've got an omnibore too like if you've got an omnibore artifact that could exist in multiple artifact that could exist in multiple artifact that could exist in multiple packages and those packages or those packages and those packages or those packages and those packages or those artifacts that exist in multiple artifacts that exist in multiple artifacts that exist in multiple products that identified by CPEs. So products that identified by CPEs. So products that identified by CPEs. So it's not going to be a simple mapping. it's not going to be a simple mapping. it's not going to be a simple mapping. it would be you can end up with a it would be you can end up with a it would be you can end up with a reverse inverse funnel like this one reverse inverse funnel like this one reverse inverse funnel like this one artifact you know uh lib C exists on artifact you know uh lib C exists on artifact you know uh lib C exists on everything and so it's like every everything and so it's like every everything and so it's like every possible CV has lib C in possible CV has lib C in possible CV has lib C in it all right the so just a quick point it all right the so just a quick point it all right the so just a quick point of clarification the printed schedule of clarification the printed schedule of clarification the printed schedule showed this was an hour the panel showed this was an hour the panel showed this was an hour the panel prepared for half an hour the online prepared for half an hour the online prepared for half an hour the online version shows a half an hour it's why version shows a half an hour it's why version shows a half an hour it's why people are bailing potentially so um if people are bailing potentially so um if people are bailing potentially so um if you want to go go. We're going to have you want to go go. We're going to have you want to go go. We're going to have just a few more questions and wrap up. just a few more questions and wrap up. just a few more questions and wrap up. So, just so everybody knows what we're So, just so everybody knows what we're So, just so everybody knows what we're doing here, we're happy to stay for the doing here, we're happy to stay for the doing here, we're happy to stay for the full hour. The panel will stay for the full hour. The panel will stay for the full hour. The panel will stay for the full hour. So, if you want to stay, full hour. So, if you want to stay, full hour. So, if you want to stay, stay. Um, all right. I'm going to ask a stay. Um, all right. I'm going to ask a stay. Um, all right. I'm going to ask a question from online. Maybe Julie, you question from online. Maybe Julie, you question from online. Maybe Julie, you can get him and we'll get him next. So, can get him and we'll get him next. So, can get him and we'll get him next. So, there's about three questions up in there's about three questions up in there's about three questions up in here. Um, I'm going to go with the last here. Um, I'm going to go with the last here. Um, I'm going to go with the last one first. how how to use Pearl with one first. how how to use Pearl with one first. how how to use Pearl with software that does not use any package software that does not use any package software that does not use any package manager like CC code or code that has manager like CC code or code that has manager like CC code or code that has been patched. been patched. been patched. Yeah, so that's that's an that's a great Yeah, so that's that's an that's a great Yeah, so that's that's an that's a great question. Um there's multiple Pearl question. Um there's multiple Pearl question. Um there's multiple Pearl types. Uh Pearl again is a specification types. Uh Pearl again is a specification types. Uh Pearl again is a specification that is extensible kind of like um you that is extensible kind of like um you that is extensible kind of like um you know URIs are extensible. Um uh one of know URIs are extensible. Um uh one of know URIs are extensible. Um uh one of the things that you could potentially do the things that you could potentially do the things that you could potentially do for C C++ cloud for example is use the for C C++ cloud for example is use the for C C++ cloud for example is use the GitHub type if your project is in fact GitHub type if your project is in fact GitHub type if your project is in fact hosted on GitHub. Um there are other hosted on GitHub. Um there are other hosted on GitHub. Um there are other ways. There's there's a bit bucket type ways. There's there's a bit bucket type ways. There's there's a bit bucket type and there's a few other types that you and there's a few other types that you and there's a few other types that you could theoretically use as well for could theoretically use as well for could theoretically use as well for things that do not fall in the norm and things that do not fall in the norm and things that do not fall in the norm and are certainly not packaged or locatable. are certainly not packaged or locatable. are certainly not packaged or locatable. Uh this could be like C++ code. It could Uh this could be like C++ code. It could Uh this could be like C++ code. It could be commercial software whatever. There be commercial software whatever. There be commercial software whatever. There actually is a SWID pearl type. Now SWID actually is a SWID pearl type. Now SWID actually is a SWID pearl type. Now SWID that's that's that's a little bit of can that's that's that's a little bit of can that's that's that's a little bit of can of worms. U SWID itself is software of worms. U SWID itself is software of worms. U SWID itself is software identity. Um the SWID specification is identity. Um the SWID specification is identity. Um the SWID specification is behind an ISO payw wall. Not a big fan. behind an ISO payw wall. Not a big fan. behind an ISO payw wall. Not a big fan. Um, the SWIDS spec essentially is an XML Um, the SWIDS spec essentially is an XML Um, the SWIDS spec essentially is an XML file, but the essence of what SWID is is file, but the essence of what SWID is is file, but the essence of what SWID is is really the the small portion of that XML really the the small portion of that XML really the the small portion of that XML file, which in fact can be represented file, which in fact can be represented file, which in fact can be represented in a package URL. And that's exactly in a package URL. And that's exactly in a package URL. And that's exactly what the SWID protype does. So, it takes what the SWID protype does. So, it takes what the SWID protype does. So, it takes a domain type approach. It uses the uh a domain type approach. It uses the uh a domain type approach. It uses the uh mandatory fields that uh normally a SWID mandatory fields that uh normally a SWID mandatory fields that uh normally a SWID would have and constructs a um a pearl would have and constructs a um a pearl would have and constructs a um a pearl from from from that. By doing this, you can essentially that. By doing this, you can essentially that. By doing this, you can essentially represent commercial software um with represent commercial software um with represent commercial software um with the the the SWID pearl type in a the the the SWID pearl type in a the the the SWID pearl type in a decentralized way just like it is for decentralized way just like it is for decentralized way just like it is for all other pro types today. So that is an all other pro types today. So that is an all other pro types today. So that is an option. um it is less than ideal uh option. um it is less than ideal uh option. um it is less than ideal uh because discovery uh becomes the next because discovery uh becomes the next because discovery uh becomes the next challenge. How do you discover all of challenge. How do you discover all of challenge. How do you discover all of these different pearl squid types? There these different pearl squid types? There these different pearl squid types? There isn't a central repository for these isn't a central repository for these isn't a central repository for these like there is for the CPE dictionary for like there is for the CPE dictionary for like there is for the CPE dictionary for example. example. example. Thanks Steve. Good question. Hands up Thanks Steve. Good question. Hands up Thanks Steve. Good question. Hands up for question in the room. for question in the room. for question in the room. Yeah, maybe two question. Oh start. Yeah, maybe two question. Oh start. Yeah, maybe two question. Oh start. Let's start here and then we'll go Let's start here and then we'll go Let's start here and then we'll go there. Sorry. I'm sorry. I didn't there. Sorry. I'm sorry. I didn't there. Sorry. I'm sorry. I didn't realize there were two. Go ahead. So, realize there were two. Go ahead. So, realize there were two. Go ahead. So, me? Yeah. Go ahead. Yeah. Um, yeah, me? Yeah. Go ahead. Yeah. Um, yeah, me? Yeah. Go ahead. Yeah. Um, yeah, great session, but I still don't great session, but I still don't great session, but I still don't understand. Well, maybe it's me, but um, understand. Well, maybe it's me, but um, understand. Well, maybe it's me, but um, why would we aim for three standards? why would we aim for three standards? why would we aim for three standards? Um, why are you fighting for three Um, why are you fighting for three Um, why are you fighting for three standards while CP is already the standards while CP is already the standards while CP is already the standard in the CV program or in the NVD standard in the CV program or in the NVD standard in the CV program or in the NVD even if it's dysfunctional right now and even if it's dysfunctional right now and even if it's dysfunctional right now and it's not speeding up and you know doing it's not speeding up and you know doing it's not speeding up and you know doing what it should do but should we not what it should do but should we not what it should do but should we not focus on one standard and then as soon focus on one standard and then as soon focus on one standard and then as soon as possible and then really you know as possible and then really you know as possible and then really you know make sure that the community and the make sure that the community and the make sure that the community and the CNAs and everyone involved are just CNAs and everyone involved are just CNAs and everyone involved are just putting their efforts in that and or am putting their efforts in that and or am putting their efforts in that and or am I missing something? Sorry. Well, CPE I missing something? Sorry. Well, CPE I missing something? Sorry. Well, CPE does not cover everything. Like it if does not cover everything. Like it if does not cover everything. Like it if you're doing open source packages and you're doing open source packages and you're doing open source packages and things, it's it's difficult to use CP in things, it's it's difficult to use CP in things, it's it's difficult to use CP in some ways. We've also heard from people some ways. We've also heard from people some ways. We've also heard from people point blank, they refuse to do CPE. point blank, they refuse to do CPE. point blank, they refuse to do CPE. We've had CNA say if you require this, We've had CNA say if you require this, We've had CNA say if you require this, we're out of the program. We've I've we're out of the program. We've I've we're out of the program. We've I've heard that to my face from people. I heard that to my face from people. I heard that to my face from people. I will never do a CPE. Go screw yourself will never do a CPE. Go screw yourself will never do a CPE. Go screw yourself basically. So, uh though I've heard that basically. So, uh though I've heard that basically. So, uh though I've heard that from people like there are people who from people like there are people who from people like there are people who hate CP with a passion. I I respect hate CP with a passion. I I respect hate CP with a passion. I I respect that. I don't necessarily feel the same that. I don't necessarily feel the same that. I don't necessarily feel the same way but there are people who are already way but there are people who are already way but there are people who are already using pearl and people who are already using pearl and people who are already using pearl and people who are already using omnibore you know smaller but using omnibore you know smaller but using omnibore you know smaller but growing so and it also identifies things growing so and it also identifies things growing so and it also identifies things like if you want to identify specific like if you want to identify specific like if you want to identify specific artifacts CP doesn't do that pearl artifacts CP doesn't do that pearl artifacts CP doesn't do that pearl doesn't do that uh but if you want to doesn't do that uh but if you want to doesn't do that uh but if you want to identify like CP came from all largely I identify like CP came from all largely I identify like CP came from all largely I hope I'm saying this right from the hope I'm saying this right from the hope I'm saying this right from the commercial vendor world when it was commercial vendor world when it was commercial vendor world when it was formed there's a lot of product it was formed there's a lot of product it was formed there's a lot of product it was originally a lot of product identifier originally a lot of product identifier originally a lot of product identifier but it's it's grown beyond that yeah you're gonna have to talk in the yeah you're gonna have to talk in the yeah you're gonna have to talk in the mic as it go. Yeah, it uh it like I said mic as it go. Yeah, it uh it like I said mic as it go. Yeah, it uh it like I said earlier just it came from a place where earlier just it came from a place where earlier just it came from a place where uh information wasn't always going to be uh information wasn't always going to be uh information wasn't always going to be available. So whether it was CS or gots available. So whether it was CS or gots available. So whether it was CS or gots or anything. Yeah, I think that's a or anything. Yeah, I think that's a or anything. Yeah, I think that's a great point because you know I read a a great point because you know I read a a great point because you know I read a a an article a while ago talking about CPE an article a while ago talking about CPE an article a while ago talking about CPE being a a standard essentially for being a a standard essentially for being a a standard essentially for automation. And I and I see Pearl as automation. And I and I see Pearl as automation. And I and I see Pearl as essentially the identifier for hyper essentially the identifier for hyper essentially the identifier for hyper automation. Um, back when CPE was built, automation. Um, back when CPE was built, automation. Um, back when CPE was built, dependency management didn't exist. Now dependency management didn't exist. Now dependency management didn't exist. Now it's the norm. You know, millions of it's the norm. You know, millions of it's the norm. You know, millions of packages exist across all these packages exist across all these packages exist across all these different ecosystems. The reality is you different ecosystems. The reality is you different ecosystems. The reality is you cannot automate that with CPE today. It cannot automate that with CPE today. It cannot automate that with CPE today. It is impossible. You can, however, do that is impossible. You can, however, do that is impossible. You can, however, do that hyper that kind of hyperamation with hyper that kind of hyperamation with hyper that kind of hyperamation with package URL today. package URL today. package URL today. Um, I will also point out the fact that Um, I will also point out the fact that Um, I will also point out the fact that CPE isn't native to the software CPE isn't native to the software CPE isn't native to the software industry and I know CPE also does industry and I know CPE also does industry and I know CPE also does hardware as well. It's not native to hardware as well. It's not native to hardware as well. It's not native to either industry and I am of the mindset either industry and I am of the mindset either industry and I am of the mindset that we should embrace more identifiers that we should embrace more identifiers that we should embrace more identifiers not necessarily for software but all the not necessarily for software but all the not necessarily for software but all the GS1 standards for example GMN and G10 GS1 standards for example GMN and G10 GS1 standards for example GMN and G10 for example for hardware devices. So I for example for hardware devices. So I for example for hardware devices. So I welcome a ecosystems where CVEes can be welcome a ecosystems where CVEes can be welcome a ecosystems where CVEes can be um can can can support multiple um can can can support multiple um can can can support multiple different types of identifiers depending different types of identifiers depending different types of identifiers depending on what type of product is vulnerable. on what type of product is vulnerable. on what type of product is vulnerable. Just reacting to the question too, Just reacting to the question too, Just reacting to the question too, Magazine, do you want to clarify uh the Magazine, do you want to clarify uh the Magazine, do you want to clarify uh the the point being made I think in the the point being made I think in the the point being made I think in the question that was asked about CPE being question that was asked about CPE being question that was asked about CPE being a standard in the CVE program and that a standard in the CVE program and that a standard in the CVE program and that phrasing isn't quite exactly the case. I phrasing isn't quite exactly the case. I phrasing isn't quite exactly the case. I think it's Yeah, it's I guess it's the think it's Yeah, it's I guess it's the think it's Yeah, it's I guess it's the the CP the CVE program does the CP the CVE program does the CP the CVE program does not we obviously do not control CPE at not we obviously do not control CPE at not we obviously do not control CPE at all. We we added in the schema the all. We we added in the schema the all. We we added in the schema the ability to embed CV identity uh CPE into ability to embed CV identity uh CPE into ability to embed CV identity uh CPE into the CV record as an identity um to the CV record as an identity um to the CV record as an identity um to support kind of what the industry is support kind of what the industry is support kind of what the industry is doing. It's kind of a this is the doing. It's kind of a this is the doing. It's kind of a this is the industry is already using CP a lot of industry is already using CP a lot of industry is already using CP a lot of people using CP from MVD's data. Uh this people using CP from MVD's data. Uh this people using CP from MVD's data. Uh this is something obviously that has demand. is something obviously that has demand. is something obviously that has demand. and we were hearing from a lot of and we were hearing from a lot of and we were hearing from a lot of different people. Hey, I want to provide different people. Hey, I want to provide different people. Hey, I want to provide CPE. Um it's part of the SISA secure by CPE. Um it's part of the SISA secure by CPE. Um it's part of the SISA secure by design pledge to provide CPE. Uh there design pledge to provide CPE. Uh there design pledge to provide CPE. Uh there so there's a lot of different driving so there's a lot of different driving so there's a lot of different driving factors behind it. And so that was the factors behind it. And so that was the factors behind it. And so that was the most obvious first one to add uh most obvious first one to add uh most obvious first one to add uh official support for. But we've also official support for. But we've also official support for. But we've also seen a lot of people ask like hey how seen a lot of people ask like hey how seen a lot of people ask like hey how about Pearl? I want to I want to put my about Pearl? I want to I want to put my about Pearl? I want to I want to put my I I use Pearl identifiers ready today. I I I use Pearl identifiers ready today. I I I use Pearl identifiers ready today. I could provide that instantaneously if could provide that instantaneously if could provide that instantaneously if you gave me a place to stick it in the you gave me a place to stick it in the you gave me a place to stick it in the record. And today there's another good record. And today there's another good record. And today there's another good way to do that. Yeah. So the next one way to do that. Yeah. So the next one way to do that. Yeah. So the next one was here and then Jerry. Well, actually, was here and then Jerry. Well, actually, was here and then Jerry. Well, actually, can I can I add one more? Oh, yeah. can I can I add one more? Oh, yeah. can I can I add one more? Oh, yeah. Absolutely. Sorry, I didn't. Yeah. Yeah. Absolutely. Sorry, I didn't. Yeah. Yeah. Absolutely. Sorry, I didn't. Yeah. Yeah. So, I I just kind of want to tie back to So, I I just kind of want to tie back to So, I I just kind of want to tie back to the original question though of like why the original question though of like why the original question though of like why one versus the ecosystem. And uh I I one versus the ecosystem. And uh I I one versus the ecosystem. And uh I I think it's important to point out that think it's important to point out that think it's important to point out that while there have been efforts uh to try while there have been efforts uh to try while there have been efforts uh to try and map CPE, the Pearl, efforts to map and map CPE, the Pearl, efforts to map and map CPE, the Pearl, efforts to map omnibr etc. Um they have not been omnibr etc. Um they have not been omnibr etc. Um they have not been holistic. They have not, you know, holistic. They have not, you know, holistic. They have not, you know, succeeded in saying one works, one succeeded in saying one works, one succeeded in saying one works, one doesn't. we can just use one. Uh I think doesn't. we can just use one. Uh I think doesn't. we can just use one. Uh I think that it's important to just accept that that it's important to just accept that that it's important to just accept that right now everyone doesn't know what the right now everyone doesn't know what the right now everyone doesn't know what the right answer is. So bringing it all right answer is. So bringing it all right answer is. So bringing it all together in one place generally speaking together in one place generally speaking together in one place generally speaking and and comparing them is going to be and and comparing them is going to be and and comparing them is going to be the only way right now that we're the only way right now that we're the only way right now that we're probably going to find what that answer probably going to find what that answer probably going to find what that answer is. And yeah and dovetailing off that I is. And yeah and dovetailing off that I is. And yeah and dovetailing off that I mean sometimes not everything maps one mean sometimes not everything maps one mean sometimes not everything maps one to one with everything else. We see that to one with everything else. We see that to one with everything else. We see that a lot with all sorts of different a lot with all sorts of different a lot with all sorts of different mission space uh de facto standards. So mission space uh de facto standards. So mission space uh de facto standards. So sorry over to you. So I'm involved in sorry over to you. So I'm involved in sorry over to you. So I'm involved in the CV codeg working group. I have no the CV codeg working group. I have no the CV codeg working group. I have no objection to put a pro into CV record objection to put a pro into CV record objection to put a pro into CV record schema but I think pro is not ready. The schema but I think pro is not ready. The schema but I think pro is not ready. The reason for that you don't support reason for that you don't support reason for that you don't support version range. So if you want support version range. So if you want support version range. So if you want support pro many products to have the version pro many products to have the version pro many products to have the version range. We don't want list 20 or 30 or range. We don't want list 20 or 30 or range. We don't want list 20 or 30 or even hundreds of products. Yeah. For the even hundreds of products. Yeah. For the even hundreds of products. Yeah. For the same CV. So I think it's a simple same CV. So I think it's a simple same CV. So I think it's a simple enhancement required for Pearl. So if enhancement required for Pearl. So if enhancement required for Pearl. So if this can be resolved so we can support this can be resolved so we can support this can be resolved so we can support that. So I have another comment for that. So I have another comment for that. So I have another comment for Chris. CP 203 is Chris. CP 203 is Chris. CP 203 is over 14 years old or 13 years old. It's over 14 years old or 13 years old. It's over 14 years old or 13 years old. It's totally totally totally outdated. So I heard N has plan to outdated. So I heard N has plan to outdated. So I heard N has plan to enhance enhance enhance CP. So we want to get involved. So CP. So we want to get involved. So CP. So we want to get involved. So reason for that it's so old reason for that it's so old reason for that it's so old anything can't be ignored or removed. So anything can't be ignored or removed. So anything can't be ignored or removed. So we want to move to the JSON based we want to move to the JSON based we want to move to the JSON based schema. So even that means big change schema. So even that means big change schema. So even that means big change for the dictionary. I think that's for the dictionary. I think that's for the dictionary. I think that's probably the right move to make it a probably the right move to make it a probably the right move to make it a more modern standard. more modern standard. more modern standard. Okay. Uh, so I'm just going to repeat a Okay. Uh, so I'm just going to repeat a Okay. Uh, so I'm just going to repeat a little bit to make sure I didn't I don't little bit to make sure I didn't I don't little bit to make sure I didn't I don't miss anything there, but um I think miss anything there, but um I think miss anything there, but um I think there was a comment uh specifically there was a comment uh specifically there was a comment uh specifically about uh CPE specification being old. It about uh CPE specification being old. It about uh CPE specification being old. It is uh it needs to be uh revised for is uh it needs to be uh revised for is uh it needs to be uh revised for modern day and I'm pretty sure we're modern day and I'm pretty sure we're modern day and I'm pretty sure we're planning to do that. Tanya will be planning to do that. Tanya will be planning to do that. Tanya will be talking about that I think in a later talking about that I think in a later talking about that I think in a later later uh talk. later uh talk. later uh talk. Um I I think I missed what you were Um I I think I missed what you were Um I I think I missed what you were talking about regarding the the JSON talking about regarding the the JSON talking about regarding the the JSON change. uh but we are as far as the MVD change. uh but we are as far as the MVD change. uh but we are as far as the MVD is concerned you know we're trying to is concerned you know we're trying to is concerned you know we're trying to represent CPE within a JSON format using represent CPE within a JSON format using represent CPE within a JSON format using one that we've been going with for quite one that we've been going with for quite one that we've been going with for quite a while uh it doesn't align with the a while uh it doesn't align with the a while uh it doesn't align with the official specification document uh and official specification document uh and official specification document uh and one of the things that would be changed one of the things that would be changed one of the things that would be changed if uh if we revise the specification if uh if we revise the specification if uh if we revise the specification would be modernizing the serialization would be modernizing the serialization would be modernizing the serialization to be you know aligned more with the to be you know aligned more with the to be you know aligned more with the JSON approach versus the uh the XML. Um JSON approach versus the uh the XML. Um JSON approach versus the uh the XML. Um I I wanted to talk to one other thing I I wanted to talk to one other thing I I wanted to talk to one other thing though which was you were mentioning the though which was you were mentioning the though which was you were mentioning the versions like version schemes and things versions like version schemes and things versions like version schemes and things like that. Um, that's a problem space like that. Um, that's a problem space like that. Um, that's a problem space for all all identification schemes for all all identification schemes for all all identification schemes still. You know, CPE has a way of still. You know, CPE has a way of still. You know, CPE has a way of handling it that works in some ways and handling it that works in some ways and handling it that works in some ways and falls short in others. Uh, Pearl, I I falls short in others. Uh, Pearl, I I falls short in others. Uh, Pearl, I I was reading up on the the VERS uh was reading up on the the VERS uh was reading up on the the VERS uh section for Pearl right now. They're section for Pearl right now. They're section for Pearl right now. They're they're working on something that looks, they're working on something that looks, they're working on something that looks, you know, like it will help resolve you know, like it will help resolve you know, like it will help resolve quite a few of some of the issues in quite a few of some of the issues in quite a few of some of the issues in that space. Uh, but even that hasn't that space. Uh, but even that hasn't that space. Uh, but even that hasn't really been solved, you know, air quotes really been solved, you know, air quotes really been solved, you know, air quotes solved quite yet. um there's still a lot solved quite yet. um there's still a lot solved quite yet. um there's still a lot of tooling and and work to be done even of tooling and and work to be done even of tooling and and work to be done even if it's on an ecosystem bye-cos basis to if it's on an ecosystem bye-cos basis to if it's on an ecosystem bye-cos basis to really get that kind of stuff uh really get that kind of stuff uh really get that kind of stuff uh hammered out the way it needs to be to hammered out the way it needs to be to hammered out the way it needs to be to be more um effective. I guess to come be more um effective. I guess to come be more um effective. I guess to come back to one of those initial questions and then uh so on the the point of um and then uh so on the the point of um and then uh so on the the point of um Pearl and versioning constraints. So the Pearl and versioning constraints. So the Pearl and versioning constraints. So the current proposal for adding Pearl to the current proposal for adding Pearl to the current proposal for adding Pearl to the CVE record format actually uh reuses the CVE record format actually uh reuses the CVE record format actually uh reuses the mechanism for expressing version mechanism for expressing version mechanism for expressing version constraints that is used for the constraints that is used for the constraints that is used for the recently added support for CPE or recently added support for CPE or recently added support for CPE or recently I guess improved support for recently I guess improved support for recently I guess improved support for CPE. So rather than relying on embedding CPE. So rather than relying on embedding CPE. So rather than relying on embedding the version number in the package URL the version number in the package URL the version number in the package URL where you're correct, you would end up where you're correct, you would end up where you're correct, you would end up specifying a bunch of them if you're specifying a bunch of them if you're specifying a bunch of them if you're trying to express uh constraints. trying to express uh constraints. trying to express uh constraints. Instead, the idea is that the pearl Instead, the idea is that the pearl Instead, the idea is that the pearl would be describing the package and then would be describing the package and then would be describing the package and then you would use the uh additional fields you would use the uh additional fields you would use the uh additional fields that constrain the versioning uh in the that constrain the versioning uh in the that constrain the versioning uh in the way that you would do it for CPE today way that you would do it for CPE today way that you would do it for CPE today in the record format. in the record format. in the record format. Yeah, I think like you mentioned earlier Yeah, I think like you mentioned earlier Yeah, I think like you mentioned earlier that the proposal was split into three that the proposal was split into three that the proposal was split into three parts. So one part is like generic parts. So one part is like generic parts. So one part is like generic representation of original identifiers representation of original identifiers representation of original identifiers just one pearl request to generically just one pearl request to generically just one pearl request to generically support multiple identifiers. Then support multiple identifiers. Then support multiple identifiers. Then there's an individual request for adding there's an individual request for adding there's an individual request for adding pearl and individual request for adding pearl and individual request for adding pearl and individual request for adding omnibore. Uh but yeah the idea is if omnibore. Uh but yeah the idea is if omnibore. Uh but yeah the idea is if you're not familiar with the CPE formats you're not familiar with the CPE formats you're not familiar with the CPE formats the same format MVD's been using like the same format MVD's been using like the same format MVD's been using like you specify the identifier and then you you specify the identifier and then you you specify the identifier and then you have a starting version either excluding have a starting version either excluding have a starting version either excluding or including and ending version or including and ending version or including and ending version including including you. So you can including including you. So you can including including you. So you can specify version ranges. Uh so you don't specify version ranges. Uh so you don't specify version ranges. Uh so you don't have to list, you know, if you had like have to list, you know, if you had like have to list, you know, if you had like with CP, you also do specific versions with CP, you also do specific versions with CP, you also do specific versions in CPE, then you'd have to list every in CPE, then you'd have to list every in CPE, then you'd have to list every CPE. Instead, you list your base CPE and CPE. Instead, you list your base CPE and CPE. Instead, you list your base CPE and then your versions. And that's the then your versions. And that's the then your versions. And that's the proposal right now for Pearl as well. Yeah, I think there was so so we just Yeah, I think there was so so we just Yeah, I think there was so so we just just a quick announcement. We have a lot just a quick announcement. We have a lot just a quick announcement. We have a lot of questions online and in the room I of questions online and in the room I of questions online and in the room I think. So in the future for the think. So in the future for the think. So in the future for the panelists, please try to do a quick panelists, please try to do a quick panelists, please try to do a quick discussion as who's going to be the one discussion as who's going to be the one discussion as who's going to be the one to answer it and then we're going to do to answer it and then we're going to do to answer it and then we're going to do another question. So one answer per uh another question. So one answer per uh another question. So one answer per uh question. I'm going to read a couple question. I'm going to read a couple question. I'm going to read a couple from the online. They've been waiting a from the online. They've been waiting a from the online. They've been waiting a moment. So we had a combination question moment. So we had a combination question moment. So we had a combination question earlier. Might have been a comment on earlier. Might have been a comment on earlier. Might have been a comment on something somebody was saying. So if it something somebody was saying. So if it something somebody was saying. So if it was your if it sounds familiar, answer was your if it sounds familiar, answer was your if it sounds familiar, answer it, please. Uh, does that mean NVD will it, please. Uh, does that mean NVD will it, please. Uh, does that mean NVD will start supporting Pearl or Pearlike start supporting Pearl or Pearlike start supporting Pearl or Pearlike identifiers? And will CP applicability identifiers? And will CP applicability identifiers? And will CP applicability elements be backported to older records elements be backported to older records elements be backported to older records in NVD? And if so, how far back? Sounds in NVD? And if so, how far back? Sounds in NVD? And if so, how far back? Sounds like two people. It was the same person. like two people. It was the same person. like two people. It was the same person. Oh, same. Yeah. So, I guess I might even Oh, same. Yeah. So, I guess I might even Oh, same. Yeah. So, I guess I might even need to hear the second one again, but need to hear the second one again, but need to hear the second one again, but uh first first question. Um, uh first first question. Um, uh first first question. Um, uh, we're looking into that. Uh so uh, we're looking into that. Uh so uh, we're looking into that. Uh so supportive pearl I think was the supportive pearl I think was the supportive pearl I think was the question. Yeah. Uh yes. So that's that's question. Yeah. Uh yes. So that's that's question. Yeah. Uh yes. So that's that's something we're looking into but uh something we're looking into but uh something we're looking into but uh tying into something I mentioned earlier tying into something I mentioned earlier tying into something I mentioned earlier is there's uh there's a little bit of is there's uh there's a little bit of is there's uh there's a little bit of work that needs to be done on work that needs to be done on work that needs to be done on understanding how how that mapping would understanding how how that mapping would understanding how how that mapping would actually occur as opposed to just saying actually occur as opposed to just saying actually occur as opposed to just saying we support two operationally. That's we support two operationally. That's we support two operationally. That's still a whole lot of effort that goes still a whole lot of effort that goes still a whole lot of effort that goes into to supporting a specific data type. into to supporting a specific data type. into to supporting a specific data type. So finding the proper way to do that is So finding the proper way to do that is So finding the proper way to do that is something worth looking something worth looking something worth looking into. And then what was the second one? into. And then what was the second one? into. And then what was the second one? And this next question is probably for And this next question is probably for And this next question is probably for the CVE program perspective around the CVE program perspective around the CVE program perspective around backporting MVD data. Correct. Uh yeah. backporting MVD data. Correct. Uh yeah. backporting MVD data. Correct. Uh yeah. Will the elements uh CPA applicability Will the elements uh CPA applicability Will the elements uh CPA applicability elements be backported to older records? elements be backported to older records? elements be backported to older records? MVD prior to us with the change in the MVD prior to us with the change in the MVD prior to us with the change in the format. format. format. Was that I guess not clear question of Was that I guess not clear question of Was that I guess not clear question of backporting the current applicability backporting the current applicability backporting the current applicability the older NVD records or in the CVE? the older NVD records or in the CVE? the older NVD records or in the CVE? Yes. Yeah, I think it's the older Yes. Yeah, I think it's the older Yes. Yeah, I think it's the older records back. Is there a discussion records back. Is there a discussion records back. Is there a discussion around backporting older CPE information around backporting older CPE information around backporting older CPE information into the the CVE list? I believe in into the the CVE list? I believe in into the the CVE list? I believe in light of it now supporting it going light of it now supporting it going light of it now supporting it going forward. Uh well, if it's the question, forward. Uh well, if it's the question, forward. Uh well, if it's the question, I'm not sure if the the question is for I'm not sure if the the question is for I'm not sure if the the question is for the CV program. No, we don't update the CV program. No, we don't update the CV program. No, we don't update CNA's stuff. In fact, it's against the CNA's stuff. In fact, it's against the CNA's stuff. In fact, it's against the rules for the program to update a CNA's rules for the program to update a CNA's rules for the program to update a CNA's record. A CNA is more than welcome to do record. A CNA is more than welcome to do record. A CNA is more than welcome to do that. So, and we have CNAs who have that. So, and we have CNAs who have that. So, and we have CNAs who have started doing that where they can go started doing that where they can go started doing that where they can go because it's compatible between the old because it's compatible between the old because it's compatible between the old stuff. NVD had did that and you're happy stuff. NVD had did that and you're happy stuff. NVD had did that and you're happy with it at CNA, you can copy it right with it at CNA, you can copy it right with it at CNA, you can copy it right across to your CV record and paste it in across to your CV record and paste it in across to your CV record and paste it in there today. And there are some CVs that there today. And there are some CVs that there today. And there are some CVs that CNAs who look at doing that. Uh but the CNAs who look at doing that. Uh but the CNAs who look at doing that. Uh but the program itself, no, we're not going to program itself, no, we're not going to program itself, no, we're not going to be going to do that because we don't be going to do that because we don't be going to do that because we don't touch the CNA container. Yeah, there touch the CNA container. Yeah, there touch the CNA container. Yeah, there there would be have to I'll just add there would be have to I'll just add there would be have to I'll just add too, there would have to be a role, for too, there would have to be a role, for too, there would have to be a role, for example, if those in the audience are example, if those in the audience are example, if those in the audience are familiar with an ADP, for example, that familiar with an ADP, for example, that familiar with an ADP, for example, that could provide that information as part could provide that information as part could provide that information as part of other records of CNAs. Um, that would of other records of CNAs. Um, that would of other records of CNAs. Um, that would be the way that it could happen. I'd be the way that it could happen. I'd be the way that it could happen. I'd love to see NVD become an ADP. love to see NVD become an ADP. love to see NVD become an ADP. Let me ask one more here and then we'll Let me ask one more here and then we'll Let me ask one more here and then we'll get in the room again. So, would get in the room again. So, would get in the room again. So, would wouldn't be putting a squid in a pearl wouldn't be putting a squid in a pearl wouldn't be putting a squid in a pearl somehow be similar to putting a CP in a somehow be similar to putting a CP in a somehow be similar to putting a CP in a pearl and then not getting the qualities pearl and then not getting the qualities pearl and then not getting the qualities of either one? Steve, do you want to of either one? Steve, do you want to of either one? Steve, do you want to take that? Uh, yeah. The um it it's not take that? Uh, yeah. The um it it's not take that? Uh, yeah. The um it it's not exactly the same thing. um the the SWID exactly the same thing. um the the SWID exactly the same thing. um the the SWID pearl type is still decentralized and pearl type is still decentralized and pearl type is still decentralized and you can distinguish the difference you can distinguish the difference you can distinguish the difference between um the tag creator like the between um the tag creator like the between um the tag creator like the manufacturer of the software versus uh manufacturer of the software versus uh manufacturer of the software versus uh maybe a third party maybe because the maybe a third party maybe because the maybe a third party maybe because the manufacturer is out of business and manufacturer is out of business and manufacturer is out of business and somebody else actually created the SWID somebody else actually created the SWID somebody else actually created the SWID tag on that um obsolete manufacturers's tag on that um obsolete manufacturers's tag on that um obsolete manufacturers's be um behalf. Um all that information is be um behalf. Um all that information is be um behalf. Um all that information is can be described in the pearl uh SWID can be described in the pearl uh SWID can be described in the pearl uh SWID pearl type in addition to a unique pearl type in addition to a unique pearl type in addition to a unique identifier which is a essentially a UID identifier which is a essentially a UID identifier which is a essentially a UID um that is the tag ID. So it's it's not um that is the tag ID. So it's it's not um that is the tag ID. So it's it's not exactly the same thing. You actually do exactly the same thing. You actually do exactly the same thing. You actually do get a lot more level of granularity get a lot more level of granularity get a lot more level of granularity because you are in fact using the Pearl because you are in fact using the Pearl because you are in fact using the Pearl specification which means that not only specification which means that not only specification which means that not only can you specify like the name and can you specify like the name and can you specify like the name and version of the product, but you can version of the product, but you can version of the product, but you can include the Pearl subpath to uh to include the Pearl subpath to uh to include the Pearl subpath to uh to represent certain modules represent certain modules represent certain modules uh within that said product, which is uh within that said product, which is uh within that said product, which is again something that CPE just doesn't again something that CPE just doesn't again something that CPE just doesn't doesn't do. Thanks. Okay, Jerry, you've doesn't do. Thanks. Okay, Jerry, you've doesn't do. Thanks. Okay, Jerry, you've been very patient. over to you again. been very patient. over to you again. been very patient. over to you again. This is for Alec or Megazone. Are there This is for Alec or Megazone. Are there This is for Alec or Megazone. Are there 447 vetos on what can go into a CVE 447 vetos on what can go into a CVE 447 vetos on what can go into a CVE record? Because Megazone, you you said record? Because Megazone, you you said record? Because Megazone, you you said somebody said I will not put a CP in a somebody said I will not put a CP in a somebody said I will not put a CP in a in a record and like if it's required, in a record and like if it's required, in a record and like if it's required, we won't do it. Like does do CNAs have we won't do it. Like does do CNAs have we won't do it. Like does do CNAs have that ability to say that we're if we're that ability to say that we're if we're that ability to say that we're if we're not going to do something and that just not going to do something and that just not going to do something and that just like derails it for the whole No, I'm like derails it for the whole No, I'm like derails it for the whole No, I'm happy to answer, but yeah, go ahead. I happy to answer, but yeah, go ahead. I happy to answer, but yeah, go ahead. I think you should answer. Yeah, it think you should answer. Yeah, it think you should answer. Yeah, it doesn't derail for everybody, but we doesn't derail for everybody, but we doesn't derail for everybody, but we have to take that in consideration. have to take that in consideration. have to take that in consideration. We're on a working group is what's the We're on a working group is what's the We're on a working group is what's the what's the purpose of the program? what's the purpose of the program? what's the purpose of the program? What's the overall benefit versus the What's the overall benefit versus the What's the overall benefit versus the trade-off? If you have a major CNA, say trade-off? If you have a major CNA, say trade-off? If you have a major CNA, say we're not going to do that. Like right we're not going to do that. Like right we're not going to do that. Like right now, F5, I'm a CNA, you know, put my CNA now, F5, I'm a CNA, you know, put my CNA now, F5, I'm a CNA, you know, put my CNA hat on. We don't do CPE today. I want to hat on. We don't do CPE today. I want to hat on. We don't do CPE today. I want to do it. I don't have the resources to get do it. I don't have the resources to get do it. I don't have the resources to get that done internally. So, if you said that done internally. So, if you said that done internally. So, if you said that has to happen today, we will stop that has to happen today, we will stop that has to happen today, we will stop publishing CBES because I can't provide publishing CBES because I can't provide publishing CBES because I can't provide that. you you would say you would stop that. you you would say you would stop that. you you would say you would stop publishing CVES, but how long until your publishing CVES, but how long until your publishing CVES, but how long until your until your customers say you aren't until your customers say you aren't until your customers say you aren't putting out CVs, you have to put out putting out CVs, you have to put out putting out CVs, you have to put out there were there were major vendors out there were there were major vendors out there were there were major vendors out there who don't publish CVS at all. there who don't publish CVS at all. there who don't publish CVS at all. There are firewall vendors and some There are firewall vendors and some There are firewall vendors and some others who haven't published CVS in others who haven't published CVS in others who haven't published CVS in years and their customers aren't making years and their customers aren't making years and their customers aren't making them do it. Yeah. And this is probably them do it. Yeah. And this is probably them do it. Yeah. And this is probably another I'm just interested in if if we another I'm just interested in if if we another I'm just interested in if if we just allow people to say we're not going just allow people to say we're not going just allow people to say we're not going to do it, we'll never be able to to get to do it, we'll never be able to to get to do it, we'll never be able to to get to record. So I will say too back to the to record. So I will say too back to the to record. So I will say too back to the point of a complete record, right? and point of a complete record, right? and point of a complete record, right? and the idea of a CNA container owning its the idea of a CNA container owning its the idea of a CNA container owning its container because that's very important container because that's very important container because that's very important principle in the program right um principle in the program right um principle in the program right um additional information can there is a additional information can there is a additional information can there is a format for example that we literally format for example that we literally format for example that we literally just mentioned right so the an ADP for just mentioned right so the an ADP for just mentioned right so the an ADP for example to add CPE data retroactively is example to add CPE data retroactively is example to add CPE data retroactively is a possibility for that to occur so for a possibility for that to occur so for a possibility for that to occur so for example if that eventuality were to example if that eventuality were to example if that eventuality were to happen hypothetically then you would happen hypothetically then you would happen hypothetically then you would have an ability for CNAs for example have an ability for CNAs for example have an ability for CNAs for example that were not interested or going to that were not interested or going to that were not interested or going to provide CPE for back you know provide CPE for back you know provide CPE for back you know information in their records. It could information in their records. It could information in their records. It could be added into a different container in be added into a different container in be added into a different container in the record, not the CDNA container. Does the record, not the CDNA container. Does the record, not the CDNA container. Does that Yeah. ADP. Yeah. Yeah. So, but the that Yeah. ADP. Yeah. Yeah. So, but the that Yeah. ADP. Yeah. Yeah. So, but the the question is that making things the question is that making things the question is that making things possible and making things required are possible and making things required are possible and making things required are two different things. So, we want to two different things. So, we want to two different things. So, we want to make it possible. Absolutely. U making make it possible. Absolutely. U making make it possible. Absolutely. U making it required. I personally would say I'm it required. I personally would say I'm it required. I personally would say I'm never going to vote to require CPE. I never going to vote to require CPE. I never going to vote to require CPE. I will never do that. I will maybe at some will never do that. I will maybe at some will never do that. I will maybe at some point say you have to provide an point say you have to provide an point say you have to provide an identifier. I won't say you have to identifier. I won't say you have to identifier. I won't say you have to provide this identifier. But maybe if provide this identifier. But maybe if provide this identifier. But maybe if you said you have to identify CPE, Pearl you said you have to identify CPE, Pearl you said you have to identify CPE, Pearl or Omniorore or whatever is supported at or Omniorore or whatever is supported at or Omniorore or whatever is supported at least one of these at some more least one of these at some more least one of these at some more flexible. I'm not going to tell an open flexible. I'm not going to tell an open flexible. I'm not going to tell an open source project go figure out CP. Um source project go figure out CP. Um source project go figure out CP. Um the having it required I think just the having it required I think just the having it required I think just increases that barrier. I'm not against increases that barrier. I'm not against increases that barrier. I'm not against you know raising that bar over time was you know raising that bar over time was you know raising that bar over time was the last we had the last uh presentation the last we had the last uh presentation the last we had the last uh presentation talk about and we're we work together on talk about and we're we work together on talk about and we're we work together on a lot of working groups. Um but it's a a lot of working groups. Um but it's a a lot of working groups. Um but it's a question of like what do you require and question of like what do you require and question of like what do you require and what is that barrier and sometimes you what is that barrier and sometimes you what is that barrier and sometimes you have some people are less objectionable have some people are less objectionable have some people are less objectionable to doing things like CVSS as opposed to to doing things like CVSS as opposed to to doing things like CVSS as opposed to identifiers. Um we are just introduced identifiers. Um we are just introduced identifiers. Um we are just introduced CP support maybe six months ago really CP support maybe six months ago really CP support maybe six months ago really we're just starting to see pickup on we're just starting to see pickup on we're just starting to see pickup on that. So I I maybe in if we start seeing that. So I I maybe in if we start seeing that. So I I maybe in if we start seeing more and more pickup and you know six more and more pickup and you know six more and more pickup and you know six months a year from now a lot of people months a year from now a lot of people months a year from now a lot of people are doing it then you can start saying are doing it then you can start saying are doing it then you can start saying maybe we can make it required but today maybe we can make it required but today maybe we can make it required but today we're we're not there yet. uh in the room question. Yeah, I'm going uh in the room question. Yeah, I'm going uh in the room question. Yeah, I'm going to say something uh really controversial to say something uh really controversial to say something uh really controversial now. So, just please bear with now. So, just please bear with now. So, just please bear with me. Um so, as a consumer of NVD data, I me. Um so, as a consumer of NVD data, I me. Um so, as a consumer of NVD data, I think for us, one of the biggest think for us, one of the biggest think for us, one of the biggest difficulties is that CNAs are in charge difficulties is that CNAs are in charge difficulties is that CNAs are in charge of their CVEEs and no one else is really of their CVEEs and no one else is really of their CVEEs and no one else is really allowed to add data to it. even even allowed to add data to it. even even allowed to add data to it. even even vendors that um make additions to that vendors that um make additions to that vendors that um make additions to that package or another release of that package or another release of that package or another release of that package. For example, package. For example, package. For example, um and you you talked earlier about the um and you you talked earlier about the um and you you talked earlier about the potential of adding pearls, you know, to potential of adding pearls, you know, to potential of adding pearls, you know, to CPE information. Um if only a CNA is CPE information. Um if only a CNA is CPE information. Um if only a CNA is allowed to add a pearl to your CBE, allowed to add a pearl to your CBE, allowed to add a pearl to your CBE, um they're never going to do it. You're um they're never going to do it. You're um they're never going to do it. You're not going to get a lot of uptake unless not going to get a lot of uptake unless not going to get a lot of uptake unless they only want to add a pearl. you're they only want to add a pearl. you're they only want to add a pearl. you're not going to get a CPE plus a couple not going to get a CPE plus a couple not going to get a CPE plus a couple pearls from different package managers, pearls from different package managers, pearls from different package managers, etc. Um, because you're not allowing etc. Um, because you're not allowing etc. Um, because you're not allowing other vendors to to make that addition. other vendors to to make that addition. other vendors to to make that addition. So, say curl releases their CPE, they're So, say curl releases their CPE, they're So, say curl releases their CPE, they're the authority on it. Why can't Ubuntu, the authority on it. Why can't Ubuntu, the authority on it. Why can't Ubuntu, you know, as a package manager also you know, as a package manager also you know, as a package manager also release, you know, here's our pearl, release, you know, here's our pearl, release, you know, here's our pearl, we're going to add it to that. we're going to add it to that. we're going to add it to that. I'm probably going to anger some of my I'm probably going to anger some of my I'm probably going to anger some of my fellow board members. fellow board members. fellow board members. Um I am 100% in favor of CNA adps. I Um I am 100% in favor of CNA adps. I Um I am 100% in favor of CNA adps. I have argued for this. Uh I'm hoping have argued for this. Uh I'm hoping have argued for this. Uh I'm hoping eventually it happens because I I am eventually it happens because I I am eventually it happens because I I am again a CNA. I'm a vendor CNA my other again a CNA. I'm a vendor CNA my other again a CNA. I'm a vendor CNA my other hat you know I I at F5. So you see you hat you know I I at F5. So you see you hat you know I I at F5. So you see you know we have open source software that know we have open source software that know we have open source software that we use in our products. So CV CVE gets we use in our products. So CV CVE gets we use in our products. So CV CVE gets published that affects us in some way published that affects us in some way published that affects us in some way but differently than it affects like but differently than it affects like but differently than it affects like generic CV records because it's specific generic CV records because it's specific generic CV records because it's specific to our implementation our use of that to our implementation our use of that to our implementation our use of that product. we will publish a security product. we will publish a security product. we will publish a security advisory on our website for our advisory on our website for our advisory on our website for our customers saying hey CV XYZ this is how customers saying hey CV XYZ this is how customers saying hey CV XYZ this is how it affects us there is today no way for it affects us there is today no way for it affects us there is today no way for me to put that back into a CVE record I me to put that back into a CVE record I me to put that back into a CVE record I would love to see that capability where would love to see that capability where would love to see that capability where especially packages are used across especially packages are used across especially packages are used across things all these different vendors this things all these different vendors this things all these different vendors this happens across the industry right you happens across the industry right you happens across the industry right you see like Cisco and Palo and Devi see like Cisco and Palo and Devi see like Cisco and Palo and Devi everybody publishes security advisories everybody publishes security advisories everybody publishes security advisories for third-party CVS I would love to see for third-party CVS I would love to see for third-party CVS I would love to see a way to feed that data right back into a way to feed that data right back into a way to feed that data right back into make the CV record the core source of make the CV record the core source of make the CV record the core source of truth truth truth I could as a CNA put my information. I could as a CNA put my information. I could as a CNA put my information. This is how it affects FIB big IP and This is how it affects FIB big IP and This is how it affects FIB big IP and you wouldn't have to go like find like you wouldn't have to go like find like you wouldn't have to go like find like oh this is CVE just go go find my oh this is CVE just go go find my oh this is CVE just go go find my website and figure out if it affects me. website and figure out if it affects me. website and figure out if it affects me. So that would allow other people to put So that would allow other people to put So that would allow other people to put in like you're you say Abuntu has this in like you're you say Abuntu has this in like you're you say Abuntu has this package and they can put their pearl in package and they can put their pearl in package and they can put their pearl in there. Uh and there are other ways to do there. Uh and there are other ways to do there. Uh and there are other ways to do that and that that's my solution to that that and that that's my solution to that that and that that's my solution to that problem would be to allow others more problem would be to allow others more problem would be to allow others more people than there are because if we have people than there are because if we have people than there are because if we have the ADP the ADP the ADP functionality let more people be ADPs. functionality let more people be ADPs. functionality let more people be ADPs. Thanks Magaza. Good, great question. I Thanks Magaza. Good, great question. I Thanks Magaza. Good, great question. I don't think it was that don't think it was that don't think it was that controversial. It's a big topic. No, controversial. It's a big topic. No, controversial. It's a big topic. No, it's it's a big topic. So, one more it's it's a big topic. So, one more it's it's a big topic. So, one more question. What we're planning to do is question. What we're planning to do is question. What we're planning to do is do one more question online and then do one more question online and then do one more question online and then we've got about five minutes. So, I want we've got about five minutes. So, I want we've got about five minutes. So, I want to ask each panelist maybe a 30 second to ask each panelist maybe a 30 second to ask each panelist maybe a 30 second one minute wrap up on your uh area of one minute wrap up on your uh area of one minute wrap up on your uh area of representation for this panel. Thank you representation for this panel. Thank you representation for this panel. Thank you everybody for coming. Um, but what's the everybody for coming. Um, but what's the everybody for coming. Um, but what's the next online? All right, last last next online? All right, last last next online? All right, last last question. Here we go. It's uh compound, question. Here we go. It's uh compound, question. Here we go. It's uh compound, so follow along. One of the current so follow along. One of the current so follow along. One of the current challenges with CPE is the addition of challenges with CPE is the addition of challenges with CPE is the addition of new products and vendors in the NIST CPE new products and vendors in the NIST CPE new products and vendors in the NIST CPE dictionary, which I assume is impacted dictionary, which I assume is impacted dictionary, which I assume is impacted by resource limitations. So, how do we by resource limitations. So, how do we by resource limitations. So, how do we overcome this limitation and what can overcome this limitation and what can overcome this limitation and what can providers/consumers do to help ensure we providers/consumers do to help ensure we providers/consumers do to help ensure we have timely additions to the NIST CPE have timely additions to the NIST CPE have timely additions to the NIST CPE dictionary? dictionary? dictionary? That's a great question. That's a great question. That's a great question. Um well I'll acknowledge the hard part Um well I'll acknowledge the hard part Um well I'll acknowledge the hard part first. Yes it is limited by resources first. Yes it is limited by resources first. Yes it is limited by resources because we are people and we have to because we are people and we have to because we are people and we have to spend time doing the uh certain things spend time doing the uh certain things spend time doing the uh certain things to to help manage it and maintain the to to help manage it and maintain the to to help manage it and maintain the applicability language to ensure it applicability language to ensure it applicability language to ensure it functions. functions. functions. Um Um Um uh the short answer is just that there's uh the short answer is just that there's uh the short answer is just that there's some extra or additional tooling some extra or additional tooling some extra or additional tooling required to help support uh being able required to help support uh being able required to help support uh being able to uh to handle the load of the types of to uh to handle the load of the types of to uh to handle the load of the types of requests that come in. Uh it's not so requests that come in. Uh it's not so requests that come in. Uh it's not so much the additions to the CPE dictionary much the additions to the CPE dictionary much the additions to the CPE dictionary just as an example I think from the just as an example I think from the just as an example I think from the question. uh it's more focused around uh question. uh it's more focused around uh question. uh it's more focused around uh managing managing managing the evolution of certain CPE entries the evolution of certain CPE entries the evolution of certain CPE entries that say started from a void of that say started from a void of that say started from a void of information and now have a great deal information and now have a great deal information and now have a great deal more that vendors or other entities are more that vendors or other entities are more that vendors or other entities are willing to share so that they can become willing to share so that they can become willing to share so that they can become a much more accurate representation of a much more accurate representation of a much more accurate representation of what they need to. Uh that's usually what they need to. Uh that's usually what they need to. Uh that's usually where the the challenge is as far as where the the challenge is as far as where the the challenge is as far as resourcing and time. Uh but the the resourcing and time. Uh but the the resourcing and time. Uh but the the short answer is just uh we need to short answer is just uh we need to short answer is just uh we need to develop more tooling and infrastructure develop more tooling and infrastructure develop more tooling and infrastructure around it and that's exactly what we're around it and that's exactly what we're around it and that's exactly what we're we're doing and have been doing. we're doing and have been doing. we're doing and have been doing. Makes sense to me. All right. Thank you. Makes sense to me. All right. Thank you. Makes sense to me. All right. Thank you. So let's go around the horn real quick.

Um, we are currently the active discussions that currently the active discussions that currently the active discussions that have been happening the past several have been happening the past several have been happening the past several meetings have been revolving around meetings have been revolving around meetings have been revolving around software identifiers as one of the core software identifiers as one of the core software identifiers as one of the core meeting topics. So getting pearl, meeting topics. So getting pearl, meeting topics. So getting pearl, getting the those three pearl pull getting the those three pearl pull getting the those three pearl pull requests we've been mentioning um have requests we've been mentioning um have requests we've been mentioning um have been a core topic we've been discussing been a core topic we've been discussing been a core topic we've been discussing and trying to work through. Uh so that's and trying to work through. Uh so that's and trying to work through.
