Um, so what do we want to talk about? Um, so what do we want to talk about? Um, so what do we want to talk about? Um, so just a very brief uh intro. Many Um, so just a very brief uh intro. Many Um, so just a very brief uh intro. Many of you know this already, but I kind of of you know this already, but I kind of of you know this already, but I kind of want to talk about this from a slightly want to talk about this from a slightly want to talk about this from a slightly different point of view. Uh, and I also different point of view. Uh, and I also different point of view. Uh, and I also want to have lots of questions and want to have lots of questions and want to have lots of questions and things, which means you'll all have things, which means you'll all have things, which means you'll all have traes over here for which I apologize. traes over here for which I apologize. traes over here for which I apologize.

Um we classic who, what, why, when. Um we won't go with how. There's been a lot of won't go with how. There's been a lot of won't go with how. There's been a lot of stuff about how including the last stuff about how including the last stuff about how including the last presentation. Thank you, Langley. Um, presentation. Thank you, Langley. Um, presentation. Thank you, Langley. Um, but h let's talk about this. So, the but h let's talk about this. So, the but h let's talk about this. So, the first thing when we're talking about the first thing when we're talking about the first thing when we're talking about the CRA um is to work out who you are. It CRA um is to work out who you are. It CRA um is to work out who you are. It sounds like a kind of weird thing to be sounds like a kind of weird thing to be sounds like a kind of weird thing to be worrying about. Um, but there are there worrying about. Um, but there are there worrying about. Um, but there are there are three sets of things when we're are three sets of things when we're are three sets of things when we're talking for the open source world, and talking for the open source world, and talking for the open source world, and I'm coming very much from the open I'm coming very much from the open I'm coming very much from the open source world here. There are three source world here. There are three source world here. There are three um sets of folks who are kind of outside um sets of folks who are kind of outside um sets of folks who are kind of outside the the the actual EU uh and these are the the the actual EU uh and these are the the the actual EU uh and these are the maintainers or man sorry the the maintainers or man sorry the the maintainers or man sorry the manufacturers who are the people who who manufacturers who are the people who who manufacturers who are the people who who make the stuff uh the open source make the stuff uh the open source make the stuff uh the open source stewards and the stewards and the stewards and the maintainers. And so the first thing is a maintainers. And so the first thing is a maintainers. And so the first thing is a uh a manufacturer is someone who uh uh a manufacturer is someone who uh uh a manufacturer is someone who uh makes products commercially available, makes products commercially available, makes products commercially available, makes them available in the market. makes them available in the market. makes them available in the market. We've already had some discussion about We've already had some discussion about We've already had some discussion about what those terms mean, but basically if what those terms mean, but basically if what those terms mean, but basically if you are the person selling it or you you are the person selling it or you you are the person selling it or you have a an importer selling it or have a an importer selling it or have a an importer selling it or distributor selling it, that means that distributor selling it, that means that distributor selling it, that means that you are a manufacturer. And we'll see you are a manufacturer. And we'll see you are a manufacturer. And we'll see what that means in a bit. what that means in a bit. what that means in a bit. Let's uh skip to the last one at the Let's uh skip to the last one at the Let's uh skip to the last one at the bottom, which is what is a maintainer? bottom, which is what is a maintainer? bottom, which is what is a maintainer? Well, a maintainer is basically what Well, a maintainer is basically what Well, a maintainer is basically what you'd expect a maintainer to be, which you'd expect a maintainer to be, which you'd expect a maintainer to be, which is someone who looks after one or more is someone who looks after one or more is someone who looks after one or more open-source projects. And of course, uh open-source projects. And of course, uh open-source projects. And of course, uh many open source projects have many many open source projects have many many open source projects have many maintainers or at least several maintainers or at least several maintainers or at least several maintainers. Um and they do what they've maintainers. Um and they do what they've maintainers. Um and they do what they've always done. There's nothing new there. always done. There's nothing new there. always done. There's nothing new there. And um the the problem that people And um the the problem that people And um the the problem that people realized when uh this was being worked realized when uh this was being worked realized when uh this was being worked out was that if you're a manufacturer out was that if you're a manufacturer out was that if you're a manufacturer and you take open source code um and you and you take open source code um and you and you take open source code um and you discover or someone discovers a discover or someone discovers a discover or someone discovers a vulnerability in that open source code vulnerability in that open source code vulnerability in that open source code let's say that Langley is the let's say that Langley is the let's say that Langley is the maintainer. I can go to the maintainer maintainer. I can go to the maintainer maintainer. I can go to the maintainer and say there's this vulnerability. I and say there's this vulnerability. I and say there's this vulnerability. I need it fixed within 72 hours. and he need it fixed within 72 hours. and he need it fixed within 72 hours. and he will say I'm going fishing or well you will say I'm going fishing or well you will say I'm going fishing or well you know he has absolutely no reason to to know he has absolutely no reason to to know he has absolutely no reason to to do that because open source is like that do that because open source is like that do that because open source is like that right and so the concept of open source right and so the concept of open source right and so the concept of open source stewards was born it's not perfect by stewards was born it's not perfect by stewards was born it's not perfect by any means but they kind of act as a as a any means but they kind of act as a as a any means but they kind of act as a as a as a buffer between maintainers and and as a buffer between maintainers and and as a buffer between maintainers and and projects and uh the manufacturers and projects and uh the manufacturers and projects and uh the manufacturers and basically the idea is that it's it's a basically the idea is that it's it's a basically the idea is that it's it's a legal entity legal entity legal entity So typically something like the Linux So typically something like the Linux So typically something like the Linux Foundation or the Eclipse Foundation or Foundation or the Eclipse Foundation or Foundation or the Eclipse Foundation or the Apache Foundation or name your you the Apache Foundation or name your you the Apache Foundation or name your you know one of your foundations here and know one of your foundations here and know one of your foundations here and they have said that they will attempt to they have said that they will attempt to they have said that they will attempt to support provide support for a specific support provide support for a specific support provide support for a specific open-source project or projects um uh so open-source project or projects um uh so open-source project or projects um uh so that manufacturers can make it available that manufacturers can make it available that manufacturers can make it available for commercial use. So it's not just for commercial use. So it's not just for commercial use. So it's not just we're going to do our best for this we're going to do our best for this we're going to do our best for this thing. We're going to make it do our thing. We're going to make it do our thing. We're going to make it do our best so that it can be used by best so that it can be used by best so that it can be used by manufacturers. Okay. So we'll come back manufacturers. Okay. So we'll come back manufacturers. Okay. So we'll come back to this a bit, but this is a really to this a bit, but this is a really to this a bit, but this is a really really important distinction here. Um really important distinction here. Um really important distinction here. Um that these are people who say we're that these are people who say we're that these are people who say we're going to do what we can and help. Which going to do what we can and help. Which going to do what we can and help. Which means that when you're looking at your means that when you're looking at your means that when you're looking at your sbombs, when you're looking at your sbombs, when you're looking at your sbombs, when you're looking at your vulnerability and incident management, vulnerability and incident management, vulnerability and incident management, you've got someone to talk to. Not you've got someone to talk to. Not you've got someone to talk to. Not saying you can force them to do things, saying you can force them to do things, saying you can force them to do things, but let's hope they're going to be a bit but let's hope they're going to be a bit but let's hope they're going to be a bit more responsive than Langley, who more responsive than Langley, who more responsive than Langley, who frankly is already getting on his boat frankly is already getting on his boat frankly is already getting on his boat and having a lovely time. What are you and having a lovely time. What are you and having a lovely time. What are you hoping to catch, Langley? What are you hoping to catch, Langley? What are you hoping to catch, Langley? What are you hoping to catch? Decided what you hope hoping to catch? Decided what you hope hoping to catch? Decided what you hope to catch on your fishing to catch on your fishing to catch on your fishing trip? Oh, bass. Nice. Excellent. Okay, trip? Oh, bass. Nice. Excellent. Okay, trip? Oh, bass. Nice. Excellent. Okay, so uh let's let's get to the next thing. so uh let's let's get to the next thing. so uh let's let's get to the next thing. So, what is this we actually talking So, what is this we actually talking So, what is this we actually talking about here? about here? about here? So the key phrase uh and it would be So the key phrase uh and it would be So the key phrase uh and it would be even more key if I'd meant to close the even more key if I'd meant to close the even more key if I'd meant to close the inverted commas which is doing bad inverted commas which is doing bad inverted commas which is doing bad things for my OCD this point is projects things for my OCD this point is projects things for my OCD this point is projects with digital elements. Uh so and these with digital elements. Uh so and these with digital elements. Uh so and these are ones that being sold in the EU right are ones that being sold in the EU right are ones that being sold in the EU right we only care about the EU although we only care about the EU although we only care about the EU although frankly you should be caring more frankly you should be caring more frankly you should be caring more broadly but for the purposes of this broadly but for the purposes of this broadly but for the purposes of this we're talking about the European Union we're talking about the European Union we're talking about the European Union sadly not the UK sorry to get political sadly not the UK sorry to get political sadly not the UK sorry to get political but there we go. So this means hardware but there we go. So this means hardware but there we go. So this means hardware and software because pretty much all uh and software because pretty much all uh and software because pretty much all uh you know hardware has some software you know hardware has some software you know hardware has some software because microode costs and accounts and because microode costs and accounts and because microode costs and accounts and so does firmware and all those sorts of so does firmware and all those sorts of so does firmware and all those sorts of things. Um and it's for businesses and things. Um and it's for businesses and things. Um and it's for businesses and consumers although we care most about consumers although we care most about consumers although we care most about the consumers and Mark Bhan and earlier the consumers and Mark Bhan and earlier the consumers and Mark Bhan and earlier on had a bit of a chat about that. uh on had a bit of a chat about that. uh on had a bit of a chat about that. uh and as we saw in our last talk by Lambi, and as we saw in our last talk by Lambi, and as we saw in our last talk by Lambi, thank you. There are these various uh thank you. There are these various uh thank you. There are these various uh classes of what these types of um uh classes of what these types of um uh classes of what these types of um uh products are and the implications for products are and the implications for products are and the implications for what you have to do with those depends what you have to do with those depends what you have to do with those depends on what those classes are. So it's on what those classes are. So it's on what those classes are. So it's different for instance from an HSM to a different for instance from an HSM to a different for instance from an HSM to a baby monitor. Um and baby monitors are baby monitor. Um and baby monitors are baby monitor. Um and baby monitors are actually called out pretty much actually called out pretty much actually called out pretty much explicitly in uh as HSM's uh in the EUR. explicitly in uh as HSM's uh in the EUR. explicitly in uh as HSM's uh in the EUR. It's a very very broad set of things. It's a very very broad set of things. It's a very very broad set of things. And as we discussed this morning, it was And as we discussed this morning, it was And as we discussed this morning, it was originally came from some uh questions originally came from some uh questions originally came from some uh questions about IoT and things like MIRI. Am I about IoT and things like MIRI. Am I about IoT and things like MIRI. Am I pronouncing that right? MI AI. about pronouncing that right? MI AI. about pronouncing that right? MI AI. about people realizing that uh lots of devices people realizing that uh lots of devices people realizing that uh lots of devices products with digital elements um could products with digital elements um could products with digital elements um could be used as jumping off uh platforms to be used as jumping off uh platforms to be used as jumping off uh platforms to do bad stuff uh to consumers and uh you do bad stuff uh to consumers and uh you do bad stuff uh to consumers and uh you know the EU cares very much about its know the EU cares very much about its know the EU cares very much about its citizens its consumers and the intention citizens its consumers and the intention citizens its consumers and the intention was to try and do something about that was to try and do something about that was to try and do something about that and they realized that actually it's not and they realized that actually it's not and they realized that actually it's not just baby monitors it's not just webcams just baby monitors it's not just webcams just baby monitors it's not just webcams uh it's pretty much anything out there uh it's pretty much anything out there uh it's pretty much anything out there that is going to have software in it that is going to have software in it that is going to have software in it which can have vulnerabilities. I know which can have vulnerabilities. I know which can have vulnerabilities. I know shocker. Um but and therefore which we shocker. Um but and therefore which we shocker. Um but and therefore which we need to to worry about. Some very need to to worry about. Some very need to to worry about. Some very cynical laughter going on in the room cynical laughter going on in the room cynical laughter going on in the room when I when I say I I don't know what when I when I say I I don't know what when I when I say I I don't know what that's all about. Um and so uh again that's all about. Um and so uh again that's all about. Um and so uh again interesting question. What about interesting question. What about interesting question. What about services? What about SAS stuff? And the services? What about SAS stuff? And the services? What about SAS stuff? And the answer of course as with anything answer of course as with anything answer of course as with anything is it depends. Thank you. Yeah. You good is it depends. Thank you. Yeah. You good is it depends. Thank you. Yeah. You good good audience. This is I'm getting some good audience. This is I'm getting some good audience. This is I'm getting some some comeback here. So um the general some comeback here. So um the general some comeback here. So um the general rule of thumb I think it's fair to say I rule of thumb I think it's fair to say I rule of thumb I think it's fair to say I am not a lawyer. Yeah. Well that's a am not a lawyer. Yeah. Well that's a am not a lawyer. Yeah. Well that's a disclaimer. General rule of thumb is if disclaimer. General rule of thumb is if disclaimer. General rule of thumb is if it is required by a physical PDA or an it is required by a physical PDA or an it is required by a physical PDA or an application or something that you're application or something that you're application or something that you're you're using uh to function correctly you're using uh to function correctly you're using uh to function correctly and it's kind of integrated then it and it's kind of integrated then it and it's kind of integrated then it counts. It's kind of pulled in. So if counts. It's kind of pulled in. So if counts. It's kind of pulled in. So if you're if you've got a a product with you're if you've got a a product with you're if you've got a a product with digital element which is just accessing digital element which is just accessing digital element which is just accessing a standard uh website and you know a standard uh website and you know a standard uh website and you know taking stuff from there then it probably taking stuff from there then it probably taking stuff from there then it probably doesn't count. But on the other hand, uh doesn't count. But on the other hand, uh doesn't count. But on the other hand, uh if you've got a service uh on on a web if you've got a service uh on on a web if you've got a service uh on on a web server which is providing uh an API server which is providing uh an API server which is providing uh an API which gives uh updates for uh for a which gives uh updates for uh for a which gives uh updates for uh for a particular service um that's being particular service um that's being particular service um that's being accessed by the the by a phone or an app accessed by the the by a phone or an app accessed by the the by a phone or an app or by uh a nanny cam then that probably or by uh a nanny cam then that probably or by uh a nanny cam then that probably does count and is pulled in wherever it does count and is pulled in wherever it does count and is pulled in wherever it is hosted in the world. is hosted in the world. is hosted in the world. Okay, just because it's hosted in the US Okay, just because it's hosted in the US Okay, just because it's hosted in the US or Canada or in the UK, that doesn't or Canada or in the UK, that doesn't or Canada or in the UK, that doesn't mean it's exempt because it's being it's mean it's exempt because it's being it's mean it's exempt because it's being it's basically part of the PTE um the product basically part of the PTE um the product basically part of the PTE um the product with digital elements. So, uh not with digital elements. So, uh not with digital elements. So, uh not services, but it depends. Um I I'm services, but it depends. Um I I'm services, but it depends. Um I I'm clearly was not having a good day clearly was not having a good day clearly was not having a good day because I failed to close some brackets because I failed to close some brackets because I failed to close some brackets here as well. I'm going to I'm literally here as well. I'm going to I'm literally here as well. I'm going to I'm literally going to go back and and and fix this going to go back and and and fix this going to go back and and and fix this and send another copy because it's doing and send another copy because it's doing and send another copy because it's doing my head in. my head in. my head in. Um so there should be a bracket closed Um so there should be a bracket closed Um so there should be a bracket closed at the end. Um so some sectors already at the end. Um so some sectors already at the end. Um so some sectors already have existing legislation and you know have existing legislation and you know have existing legislation and you know aviation, medicine, automotive. Um and aviation, medicine, automotive. Um and aviation, medicine, automotive. Um and that's not to say that the EUR doesn't that's not to say that the EUR doesn't that's not to say that the EUR doesn't apply but as Kro says this morning it's apply but as Kro says this morning it's apply but as Kro says this morning it's likely that the existing legislation uh likely that the existing legislation uh likely that the existing legislation uh takes precedent over takes precedent over takes precedent over that and it is it is well exactly. So it that and it is it is well exactly. So it that and it is it is well exactly. So it is as uh Mark Bahannan points out is as uh Mark Bahannan points out is as uh Mark Bahannan points out explicitly called out. So there are explicitly called out. So there are explicitly called out. So there are times when uh you don't need to worry so times when uh you don't need to worry so times when uh you don't need to worry so much because you should already be much because you should already be much because you should already be worrying is what it comes down worrying is what it comes down worrying is what it comes down to. And of course you all are. It's very to. And of course you all are. It's very to. And of course you all are. It's very cynical crowd this. I don't remember cynical crowd this. I don't remember cynical crowd this. I don't remember this moment. Maybe it's just maybe it's this moment. Maybe it's just maybe it's this moment. Maybe it's just maybe it's just me. So what's next? Why? Oh well just me. So what's next? Why? Oh well just me. So what's next? Why? Oh well this is the reason that is not a that is this is the reason that is not a that is this is the reason that is not a that is not a bracket. That is a a a smiley face not a bracket. That is a a a smiley face not a bracket. That is a a a smiley face and that's fine. Maybe we can pretend and that's fine. Maybe we can pretend and that's fine. Maybe we can pretend that's the bracket from the previous that's the bracket from the previous that's the bracket from the previous one. Okay, fine. Uh, so people are one. Okay, fine. Uh, so people are one. Okay, fine. Uh, so people are taking pictures of this slide. You all taking pictures of this slide. You all taking pictures of this slide. You all know it's true, right? Cyber security is know it's true, right? Cyber security is know it's true, right? Cyber security is currently rubbish except for all the currently rubbish except for all the currently rubbish except for all the companies for which you work who do the companies for which you work who do the companies for which you work who do the perfect job, right? And so it's fine. perfect job, right? And so it's fine. perfect job, right? And so it's fine. Okay, well done. You got big thumbs up Okay, well done. You got big thumbs up Okay, well done. You got big thumbs up at the back. Thank you. Um, and as I at the back. Thank you. Um, and as I at the back. Thank you. Um, and as I said already, this is this is partly to said already, this is this is partly to said already, this is this is partly to reduce jumping off attacks. It starts reduce jumping off attacks. It starts reduce jumping off attacks. It starts partly to uh stop people chaining partly to uh stop people chaining partly to uh stop people chaining things. I don't know if any of you saw a things. I don't know if any of you saw a things. I don't know if any of you saw a uh there was a a talk yesterday by uh there was a a talk yesterday by uh there was a a talk yesterday by someone from uh NCO was it someone from uh NCO was it someone from uh NCO was it NC so was NC so was NC so was it NSO? Yeah. Who talked about chaining it NSO? Yeah. Who talked about chaining it NSO? Yeah. Who talked about chaining and this is exactly the thing they're and this is exactly the thing they're and this is exactly the thing they're trying to stop is people chaining trying to stop is people chaining trying to stop is people chaining attacks and using one maybe low uh low attacks and using one maybe low uh low attacks and using one maybe low uh low to medium uh vulnerability to to to medium uh vulnerability to to to medium uh vulnerability to to escalate and and do bad things. So, we escalate and and do bad things. So, we escalate and and do bad things. So, we all know this is a problem and this is all know this is a problem and this is all know this is a problem and this is what um yeah, the EU got bored of and what um yeah, the EU got bored of and what um yeah, the EU got bored of and said, "Well, we're just going to stop it said, "Well, we're just going to stop it said, "Well, we're just going to stop it everywhere and fix it and everything everywhere and fix it and everything everywhere and fix it and everything will be perfect." Thank will be perfect." Thank will be perfect." Thank you. Um when we've uh we've talked a you. Um when we've uh we've talked a you. Um when we've uh we've talked a little bit about this as well. Uh and little bit about this as well. Uh and little bit about this as well. Uh and the answer is pretty much everything the answer is pretty much everything the answer is pretty much everything uh um by December 2027, but some stuff uh um by December 2027, but some stuff uh um by December 2027, but some stuff does come in a year earlier uh on all does come in a year earlier uh on all does come in a year earlier uh on all the vulnerability and incident stuff. the vulnerability and incident stuff. the vulnerability and incident stuff. again as Langley uh mentioned a bit again as Langley uh mentioned a bit again as Langley uh mentioned a bit earlier uh which means earlier uh which means earlier uh which means no don't don't wait till then do it now no don't don't wait till then do it now no don't don't wait till then do it now please please please do it now because please please please do it now because please please please do it now because if you're not doing it now you're going if you're not doing it now you're going if you're not doing it now you're going to have problems because what this comes to have problems because what this comes to have problems because what this comes down to and I I believe this very down to and I I believe this very down to and I I believe this very strongly is it's about processes we need strongly is it's about processes we need strongly is it's about processes we need to do the processes and we need to do to do the processes and we need to do to do the processes and we need to do them now because uh vulnerability them now because uh vulnerability them now because uh vulnerability assessment and risk assessment is a assessment and risk assessment is a assessment and risk assessment is a process it's not a one-off thing, process it's not a one-off thing, process it's not a one-off thing, something you need to teach your teams, something you need to teach your teams, something you need to teach your teams, teach your company, teach your product teach your company, teach your product teach your company, teach your product managers, teach your engineers, teach managers, teach your engineers, teach managers, teach your engineers, teach your testers about so it becomes part of your testers about so it becomes part of your testers about so it becomes part of what you do. And yes, places like Dell what you do. And yes, places like Dell what you do. And yes, places like Dell do this already and they've been do this already and they've been do this already and they've been thinking about it for a long time, but thinking about it for a long time, but thinking about it for a long time, but we need to embed this into our practice. we need to embed this into our practice. we need to embed this into our practice. It should be what we're doing It should be what we're doing It should be what we're doing anyway. Um, so this is my very short, anyway. Um, so this is my very short, anyway. Um, so this is my very short, you know, catchup of of what it is. uh you know, catchup of of what it is. uh you know, catchup of of what it is. uh you've got manufacturers uh stewards and you've got manufacturers uh stewards and you've got manufacturers uh stewards and kind of it doesn't really uh apply to kind of it doesn't really uh apply to kind of it doesn't really uh apply to maintainers. There's not much you can do maintainers. There's not much you can do maintainers. There's not much you can do as a uh as the EU to uh to tell people as a uh as the EU to uh to tell people as a uh as the EU to uh to tell people that they have to uh uh if they're open that they have to uh uh if they're open that they have to uh uh if they're open source folks they have to do particular source folks they have to do particular source folks they have to do particular things. Um it's products with diligent things. Um it's products with diligent things. Um it's products with diligent elements and look I've failed to close elements and look I've failed to close elements and look I've failed to close that again uh because why? because cyber that again uh because why? because cyber that again uh because why? because cyber security is currently rubbish and fully security is currently rubbish and fully security is currently rubbish and fully enforced uh in uh December enforced uh in uh December enforced uh in uh December 27. So this is kind of how I see the 27. So this is kind of how I see the 27. So this is kind of how I see the three things that we need to uh need to three things that we need to uh need to three things that we need to uh need to be working on. Again, you guys know this be working on. Again, you guys know this be working on. Again, you guys know this already, right? You folks know this already, right? You folks know this already, right? You folks know this already, but the the three things that I already, but the the three things that I already, but the the three things that I think are called out most by the EU uh think are called out most by the EU uh think are called out most by the EU uh CRA is risk assessment. And someone CRA is risk assessment. And someone CRA is risk assessment. And someone wisely said I think in the last one that wisely said I think in the last one that wisely said I think in the last one that you know risk assessment is kind of core you know risk assessment is kind of core you know risk assessment is kind of core to everything about the EUR. Um to everything about the EUR. Um to everything about the EUR. Um vulnerability and incident uh management vulnerability and incident uh management vulnerability and incident uh management uh and we talk about supply chain a lot uh and we talk about supply chain a lot uh and we talk about supply chain a lot but I I am an engineer really an but I I am an engineer really an but I I am an engineer really an application engineer. Sorry it's yeah application engineer. Sorry it's yeah application engineer. Sorry it's yeah they're my fault those bugs. Um no one they're my fault those bugs. Um no one they're my fault those bugs. Um no one lets me write code anymore. It's fine. I lets me write code anymore. It's fine. I lets me write code anymore. It's fine. I just I'm an architect now. I just draw just I'm an architect now. I just draw just I'm an architect now. I just draw boxes. Um but it's about dependency boxes. Um but it's about dependency boxes. Um but it's about dependency management right? Because if you don't management right? Because if you don't management right? Because if you don't understand all the dependencies in your understand all the dependencies in your understand all the dependencies in your chain and if you can't list them and if chain and if you can't list them and if chain and if you can't list them and if you can't track what their vulnerability you can't track what their vulnerability you can't track what their vulnerability and incident management is and what and incident management is and what and incident management is and what their risk assessments are then it's their risk assessments are then it's their risk assessments are then it's going to be very difficult to do the going to be very difficult to do the going to be very difficult to do the other stuff. And you know these are other stuff. And you know these are other stuff. And you know these are absolutely interconnected and we have to absolutely interconnected and we have to absolutely interconnected and we have to think of them that way and we have to think of them that way and we have to think of them that way and we have to create our processes to reflect that create our processes to reflect that create our processes to reflect that that is the case. that is the case. that is the case. Uh, and you know, hang on. I hope that Uh, and you know, hang on. I hope that Uh, and you know, hang on. I hope that most of you folks are are thinking this most of you folks are are thinking this most of you folks are are thinking this already. Again, the cynical laughter is already. Again, the cynical laughter is already. Again, the cynical laughter is is upsetting. So hopefully, yes. Um, but is upsetting. So hopefully, yes. Um, but is upsetting. So hopefully, yes. Um, but maybe not as joined up as as we'd like. maybe not as joined up as as we'd like. maybe not as joined up as as we'd like. And now, of course, you get added And now, of course, you get added And now, of course, you get added conformance testing. So, um, we all love conformance testing. So, um, we all love conformance testing. So, um, we all love a good audit, a good audit, a good audit, right? It's Oh, thank you. One person right? It's Oh, thank you. One person right? It's Oh, thank you. One person said, "Right, I I have I have to admit said, "Right, I I have I have to admit said, "Right, I I have I have to admit that I was once an auditor. I worked for that I was once an auditor. I worked for that I was once an auditor. I worked for a year or so, so as an auditor, but I a year or so, so as an auditor, but I a year or so, so as an auditor, but I I'm off it now. I you know, I didn't I'm off it now. I you know, I didn't I'm off it now. I you know, I didn't need it. I could uh give it up anytime I need it. I could uh give it up anytime I need it. I could uh give it up anytime I wanted. uh uh the power the power no so wanted. uh uh the power the power no so wanted. uh uh the power the power no so but you know we we the EU is going to but you know we we the EU is going to but you know we we the EU is going to make you do this and again as we've seen make you do this and again as we've seen make you do this and again as we've seen in some of the other uh talks the level in some of the other uh talks the level in some of the other uh talks the level of conformance testing and whether it's of conformance testing and whether it's of conformance testing and whether it's internal to your organization or internal to your organization or internal to your organization or external to organization depends on external to organization depends on external to organization depends on mainly the class of product you're mainly the class of product you're mainly the class of product you're putting on the market you're making putting on the market you're making putting on the market you're making available on the market if it's an HSM available on the market if it's an HSM available on the market if it's an HSM uh uh something like that which is or uh uh something like that which is or uh uh something like that which is or uh a firewall because firewalls are uh a firewall because firewalls are uh a firewall because firewalls are perfect and fix everything. But if it's perfect and fix everything. But if it's perfect and fix everything. But if it's a a a product which is designed with a a a product which is designed with a a a product which is designed with security in mind as kind of the main security in mind as kind of the main security in mind as kind of the main measure, then that's likely to have the measure, then that's likely to have the measure, then that's likely to have the highest level of conformance highest level of conformance highest level of conformance requirements uh and require you requirements uh and require you requirements uh and require you basically to uh submit lots of basically to uh submit lots of basically to uh submit lots of information to one of the uh EU bodies. information to one of the uh EU bodies. information to one of the uh EU bodies. On the other hand, if it's something On the other hand, if it's something On the other hand, if it's something which is um unlikely to have big which is um unlikely to have big which is um unlikely to have big security impact, then you uh should be security impact, then you uh should be security impact, then you uh should be able to do uh the conformance uh able to do uh the conformance uh able to do uh the conformance uh gathering yourself and submit that uh gathering yourself and submit that uh gathering yourself and submit that uh and hopefully that will be sufficient. and hopefully that will be sufficient. and hopefully that will be sufficient. I'm unsure whether the EU has said I'm unsure whether the EU has said I'm unsure whether the EU has said they're going to do kind of spot checks, they're going to do kind of spot checks, they're going to do kind of spot checks, random checks on people of that. I I random checks on people of that. I I random checks on people of that. I I don't know that that might turn up. I don't know that that might turn up. I don't know that that might turn up. I wouldn't be Oh, Mark has a view on that. Yep. This is the CE ecosystem. Yep. Okay. So, let me let me just repeat Yep. Okay. So, let me let me just repeat Yep. Okay. So, let me let me just repeat that for people who didn't maybe catch that for people who didn't maybe catch that for people who didn't maybe catch it. Um Mark uh who is a lawyer, but he's it.

There will be spot checks approaches. There will be spot checks approaches. There will be spot checks and things. Okay, that's that kind of and things. Okay, that's that kind of and things. Okay, that's that kind of makes sense. One thing that's really makes sense. One thing that's really makes sense. One thing that's really important is that, you know, one of the important is that, you know, one of the important is that, you know, one of the things you're going to be doing is things you're going to be doing is things you're going to be doing is putting in risk assessments. You're putting in risk assessments. You're putting in risk assessments. You're going to be putting in design going to be putting in design going to be putting in design documentation. You're going to be documentation. You're going to be documentation. You're going to be talking about, you know, your talking about, you know, your talking about, you know, your vulnerability management. Um, that is vulnerability management. Um, that is vulnerability management. Um, that is not stuff that is necessarily going to not stuff that is necessarily going to not stuff that is necessarily going to be shared with the public. um which I be shared with the public. um which I be shared with the public. um which I was a bit concerned about when I first was a bit concerned about when I first was a bit concerned about when I first saw that that you know you you've got to saw that that you know you you've got to saw that that you know you you've got to submit this but this is being submitted submit this but this is being submitted submit this but this is being submitted to these agencies not made uh public. to these agencies not made uh public. to these agencies not made uh public. Now if you want to make your risk Now if you want to make your risk Now if you want to make your risk assessment public I think that's a very assessment public I think that's a very assessment public I think that's a very interesting and possibly brave thing to interesting and possibly brave thing to interesting and possibly brave thing to do but on the other hand um also a great do but on the other hand um also a great do but on the other hand um also a great way to get people to think about uh how way to get people to think about uh how way to get people to think about uh how much they trust uh you and your uh your much they trust uh you and your uh your much they trust uh you and your uh your products. So uh the next thing I want to products. So uh the next thing I want to products. So uh the next thing I want to do is uh is to let you ask yourselves do is uh is to let you ask yourselves do is uh is to let you ask yourselves which of these worlds do you inhabit? which of these worlds do you inhabit? which of these worlds do you inhabit? Who are you in this context? So this is Who are you in this context? So this is Who are you in this context? So this is my brief um description of how to work my brief um description of how to work my brief um description of how to work out whether you're a maintainer, an open out whether you're a maintainer, an open out whether you're a maintainer, an open source steward uh or a manufacturer. So source steward uh or a manufacturer. So source steward uh or a manufacturer. So basically if you sell or otherwise make basically if you sell or otherwise make basically if you sell or otherwise make money from PTE products with digital money from PTE products with digital money from PTE products with digital elements in the EU then you are pretty elements in the EU then you are pretty elements in the EU then you are pretty much unequivocally much unequivocally much unequivocally a come on Syria a come on Syria a come on Syria a manufacturer that's very good thank a manufacturer that's very good thank a manufacturer that's very good thank you um you may that may happen via an you um you may that may happen via an you um you may that may happen via an importer via distributor but basically importer via distributor but basically importer via distributor but basically that's what you are okay so if you prov that's what you are okay so if you prov that's what you are okay so if you prov if if you if you provide some level of if if you if you provide some level of if if you if you provide some level of support for open source projects and you support for open source projects and you support for open source projects and you state that's what you can do then you state that's what you can do then you state that's what you can do then you are probably are probably are probably a an open-source steward. Yes, you are a a an open-source steward. Yes, you are a a an open-source steward. Yes, you are a steward. Um few of you are likely to be steward. Um few of you are likely to be steward. Um few of you are likely to be that but we'll come back to that because that but we'll come back to that because that but we'll come back to that because I think it's really really interesting I think it's really really interesting I think it's really really interesting and if you do what you do now which is and if you do what you do now which is and if you do what you do now which is open source stuff then you're probably open source stuff then you're probably open source stuff then you're probably a maintainer. Okay. a maintainer. Okay. a maintainer. Okay. So what happens if you So what happens if you So what happens if you are a are a are a company which sells a product or service company which sells a product or service company which sells a product or service which is based on an open-source project which is based on an open-source project which is based on an open-source project which are you so there's a very question can you you so there's a very question can you you so there's a very question can you be both and I think the answer is yes be both and I think the answer is yes be both and I think the answer is yes and no it depends so I think it's useful and no it depends so I think it's useful and no it depends so I think it's useful to think here about the distinction to think here about the distinction to think here about the distinction between a project and a product, right? between a project and a product, right? between a project and a product, right? A product is a supported A product is a supported A product is a supported version of something which may be an version of something which may be an version of something which may be an open- source project, right? And so if open- source project, right? And so if open- source project, right? And so if you're putting a product out, then you you're putting a product out, then you you're putting a product out, then you are the manufacturer for that product. are the manufacturer for that product. are the manufacturer for that product. Now you may also be the maintainer for Now you may also be the maintainer for Now you may also be the maintainer for that that that project in which case you may also be a project in which case you may also be a project in which case you may also be a steward for that project if you decide steward for that project if you decide steward for that project if you decide that you want to take on that role that you want to take on that role that you want to take on that role particularly if other organizations are particularly if other organizations are particularly if other organizations are using that using that using that project in uh in their project in uh in their project in uh in their products. So you can kind of be both and products. So you can kind of be both and products. So you can kind of be both and of course you may have maintainers who of course you may have maintainers who of course you may have maintainers who you employ as well. you employ as well. you employ as well. The general uh legal understanding seems The general uh legal understanding seems The general uh legal understanding seems to be although we're waiting for a to be although we're waiting for a to be although we're waiting for a definitive answer on this from the EU definitive answer on this from the EU definitive answer on this from the EU that if you are a single person, a that if you are a single person, a that if you are a single person, a single project, a single single project, a single single project, a single maintainer, you cannot be a maintainer, you cannot be a maintainer, you cannot be a steward. It's a bit fuzzy, but we're and steward. It's a bit fuzzy, but we're and steward. It's a bit fuzzy, but we're and we're waiting for definitive answer on we're waiting for definitive answer on we're waiting for definitive answer on that. But even if that is possible, you that. But even if that is possible, you that. But even if that is possible, you are only a steward if you say you want are only a steward if you say you want are only a steward if you say you want to be a steward and you are making a to be a steward and you are making a to be a steward and you are making a specific uh uh commitment to support specific uh uh commitment to support specific uh uh commitment to support that open-source project for use within that open-source project for use within that open-source project for use within APDE. Okay. And again, that's really APDE. Okay. And again, that's really APDE. Okay. And again, that's really important. It's to provide that support. important. It's to provide that support. important. It's to provide that support. There's some really interesting There's some really interesting There's some really interesting questions about um what if a steward questions about um what if a steward questions about um what if a steward decides they only want to support uh a decides they only want to support uh a decides they only want to support uh a uh project for certain fields of uh project for certain fields of uh project for certain fields of endeavor. So they only want to allow it endeavor. So they only want to allow it endeavor. So they only want to allow it for finance and leisure for instance for finance and leisure for instance for finance and leisure for instance rather than defense. Uh which kind of rather than defense. Uh which kind of rather than defense. Uh which kind of breaks the standard open-source model breaks the standard open-source model breaks the standard open-source model about you can use it for anything. But about you can use it for anything. But about you can use it for anything. But we'll come to that when we come to it. we'll come to that when we come to it. we'll come to that when we come to it. And I don't think anyone's uh we have a And I don't think anyone's uh we have a And I don't think anyone's uh we have a question from the audience. Yeah. So this is a great question. Are any are So this is a great question. Are any are So this is a great question. Are any are the open source stewards taking on any the open source stewards taking on any the open source stewards taking on any liability? It's like I've thought of the liability? It's like I've thought of the liability? It's like I've thought of the question before, isn't it? So uh question before, isn't it? So uh question before, isn't it? So uh conformance obligations are very conformance obligations are very conformance obligations are very specific and they're based on the type specific and they're based on the type specific and they're based on the type of of of PTE. There are some obligations on the PTE. There are some obligations on the PTE. There are some obligations on the uh the open source stewards, but I think uh the open source stewards, but I think uh the open source stewards, but I think to say they have liability would be to say they have liability would be to say they have liability would be would be going too far. uh and the the would be going too far. uh and the the would be going too far. uh and the the push back that they can get and the push back that they can get and the push back that they can get and the penalties available to the EU uh there penalties available to the EU uh there penalties available to the EU uh there seems to be very little there at all. seems to be very little there at all. seems to be very little there at all. Okay. So there's not much there and uh Okay. So there's not much there and uh Okay. So there's not much there and uh in terms of the maintainers they have no in terms of the maintainers they have no in terms of the maintainers they have no obligations. So what does this tell us obligations. So what does this tell us obligations. So what does this tell us if you're a manufacturer and you consume if you're a manufacturer and you consume if you're a manufacturer and you consume um open source projects? Well, the first um open source projects? Well, the first um open source projects? Well, the first thing is it tells us that you almost thing is it tells us that you almost thing is it tells us that you almost certainly want there to be a steward for certainly want there to be a steward for certainly want there to be a steward for that open source project, right? Because that open source project, right? Because that open source project, right? Because they're hopefully going to be provided they're hopefully going to be provided they're hopefully going to be provided support, right? support, right? support, right? But it tells us something else, which is But it tells us something else, which is But it tells us something else, which is that if you care about that project and that if you care about that project and that if you care about that project and you care about that level of support and you care about that level of support and you care about that level of support and the vulnerabilities being fixed and the the vulnerabilities being fixed and the the vulnerabilities being fixed and the incidents being reported, you are going incidents being reported, you are going incidents being reported, you are going to need to to uh commit resources, human to need to to uh commit resources, human to need to to uh commit resources, human or money or other to that steward and to or money or other to that steward and to or money or other to that steward and to that project so that you are happy that that project so that you are happy that that project so that you are happy that what you're consuming has a decent ent what you're consuming has a decent ent what you're consuming has a decent ent chance of being chance of being chance of being supportable because as there are few supportable because as there are few supportable because as there are few obligations on the steward, it is down obligations on the steward, it is down obligations on the steward, it is down to the community to make this stuff to the community to make this stuff to the community to make this stuff happen. My hope is that this provides a happen. My hope is that this provides a happen. My hope is that this provides a resurgence in people supporting resurgence in people supporting resurgence in people supporting open-source projects and as again open-source projects and as again open-source projects and as again someone said earlier this uh today someone said earlier this uh today someone said earlier this uh today realizing that as you um in the same way realizing that as you um in the same way realizing that as you um in the same way that you put aside a maybe a certain that you put aside a maybe a certain that you put aside a maybe a certain percentage of your revenue or your percentage of your revenue or your percentage of your revenue or your profit to your IT team that the same profit to your IT team that the same profit to your IT team that the same needs to be done for your open-source uh needs to be done for your open-source uh needs to be done for your open-source uh commitments. Another question or comment commitments. Another question or comment commitments. Another question or comment from over there. Okay. So, so, so, so the question I Okay. So, so, so, so the question I Okay. So, so, so, so the question I think is uh is there a financial think is uh is there a financial think is uh is there a financial incentive uh to support open source incentive uh to support open source incentive uh to support open source stewards as a man manufacturer? what's stewards as a man manufacturer? what's stewards as a man manufacturer? what's to stop uh companies just providing open to stop uh companies just providing open to stop uh companies just providing open providing a providing a providing a product uh to strip mine open source and product uh to strip mine open source and product uh to strip mine open source and the answer is that well if you do that the answer is that well if you do that the answer is that well if you do that well a you're just going to push it well a you're just going to push it well a you're just going to push it further down yeah because they they further down yeah because they they further down yeah because they they build on other open source projects as build on other open source projects as build on other open source projects as well uh so I don't think it necessarily well uh so I don't think it necessarily well uh so I don't think it necessarily helps uh and helps uh and helps uh and b you can always fork right and people b you can always fork right and people b you can always fork right and people will fork and they will do that and I will fork and they will do that and I will fork and they will do that and I think that the the models that I mean we think that the the models that I mean we think that the the models that I mean we we know that they're going to be the we know that they're going to be the we know that they're going to be the foundations are going to take on foundations are going to take on foundations are going to take on stewardship right that works really well stewardship right that works really well stewardship right that works really well for them and that I think is the most for them and that I think is the most for them and that I think is the most efficient economic way of supporting efficient economic way of supporting efficient economic way of supporting uh this with uh they've been the uh this with uh they've been the uh this with uh they've been the stewards because it means that stewards because it means that stewards because it means that manufacturers can put in fractional manufacturers can put in fractional manufacturers can put in fractional parts of you know their work and get a parts of you know their work and get a parts of you know their work and get a the um efficiencies of scale the um efficiencies of scale the um efficiencies of scale and possibly efficiencies of scope by and possibly efficiencies of scope by and possibly efficiencies of scope by doing that. There is no liability indeed. But that. There is no liability indeed. But that. There is no liability indeed. But if you don't if someone's got to be be if you don't if someone's got to be be if you don't if someone's got to be be be helping that, right? Someone's got to be helping that, right? Someone's got to be helping that, right? Someone's got to be providing something that you can use. be providing something that you can use. be providing something that you can use. And if you can't push back on liability, And if you can't push back on liability, And if you can't push back on liability, the only thing you can do is the only thing you can do is the only thing you can do is resource. Let's carry on. We may have resource. Let's carry on. We may have resource. Let's carry on. We may have time for this later. We're running a bit time for this later. We're running a bit time for this later. We're running a bit low on time. So uh this is entirely the low on time. So uh this is entirely the low on time. So uh this is entirely the economics of this are still being worked economics of this are still being worked economics of this are still being worked out. You are quite out. You are quite out. You are quite right. So what do I need to do? What do right. So what do I need to do? What do right. So what do I need to do? What do you need? What I need to do is close you need? What I need to do is close you need? What I need to do is close some inverted commas and some brackets. some inverted commas and some brackets. some inverted commas and some brackets. But what do you need to do? Right. Well, But what do you need to do? Right. Well, But what do you need to do? Right. Well, first of all, you need to decide what first of all, you need to decide what first of all, you need to decide what role you are. Are you a maintainer, an role you are. Are you a maintainer, an role you are. Are you a maintainer, an open source steward, a manufacturer? All open source steward, a manufacturer? All open source steward, a manufacturer? All three with different hats three with different hats three with different hats on. Um you need to get involved in the on. Um you need to get involved in the on. Um you need to get involved in the community. You need at the very least to community. You need at the very least to community. You need at the very least to understand what you're uh uh consuming understand what you're uh uh consuming understand what you're uh uh consuming and what impact that is going to have on and what impact that is going to have on and what impact that is going to have on what you're doing. You got to work out what you're doing. You got to work out what you're doing. You got to work out what your obligations are and how you what your obligations are and how you what your obligations are and how you can actually meet those and then put can actually meet those and then put can actually meet those and then put processes in place. Again, again, again, processes in place. Again, again, again, processes in place. Again, again, again, it is processes that you need to be it is processes that you need to be it is processes that you need to be working out. You also need to talk to working out. You also need to talk to working out. You also need to talk to your ecosystem. work out what you want your ecosystem. work out what you want your ecosystem. work out what you want from them, how you can work together, from them, how you can work together, from them, how you can work together, and what the appropriate uh uh and what the appropriate uh uh and what the appropriate uh uh relationships you should have. And then relationships you should have. And then relationships you should have. And then when it's all done, you can sit back and when it's all done, you can sit back and when it's all done, you can sit back and feel smug. You'll have nothing to worry feel smug. You'll have nothing to worry feel smug. You'll have nothing to worry about. And uh the 20, you know, December about. And uh the 20, you know, December about. And uh the 20, you know, December 26 will come along and 27 and everything 26 will come along and 27 and everything 26 will come along and 27 and everything will be fine. Uh and Langley will be will be fine. Uh and Langley will be will be fine. Uh and Langley will be still be fishing, so he'll be still be fishing, so he'll be still be fishing, so he'll be happy. Uh where can you get information? happy. Uh where can you get information? happy. Uh where can you get information? Um there's a few things uh here. If you Um there's a few things uh here. If you Um there's a few things uh here. If you want a better uh slide, uh please look want a better uh slide, uh please look want a better uh slide, uh please look at uh Crob's talk this morning, which at uh Crob's talk this morning, which at uh Crob's talk this morning, which has loads more um starting points, but has loads more um starting points, but has loads more um starting points, but there here are a few things there, there here are a few things there, there here are a few things there, including uh some articles that I I including uh some articles that I I including uh some articles that I I wrote for the OpenSSF about, you know, wrote for the OpenSSF about, you know, wrote for the OpenSSF about, you know, how how you need to know about what's how how you need to know about what's how how you need to know about what's going on. And so here's here's the big going on. And so here's here's the big going on. And so here's here's the big question. U is it boring, scary, or question. U is it boring, scary, or question. U is it boring, scary, or exciting? And I spent literally minutes exciting? And I spent literally minutes exciting? And I spent literally minutes finding fonts which I felt were finding fonts which I felt were finding fonts which I felt were appropriate appropriate appropriate uh for that. I mean don't I didn't go uh for that. I mean don't I didn't go uh for that. I mean don't I didn't go out and get fonts. They were already on out and get fonts. They were already on out and get fonts. They were already on my drop down. Don't get me wrong, but my drop down. Don't get me wrong, but my drop down. Don't get me wrong, but but I really thought about that. So I but I really thought about that. So I but I really thought about that.
