I know we have uh thanks for joining. I know we have uh thanks for joining. I know we have some strong competition in some of the some strong competition in some of the some strong competition in some of the other rooms right now, but I wanted to other rooms right now, but I wanted to other rooms right now, but I wanted to talk about my experience uh running the talk about my experience uh running the talk about my experience uh running the PER at um service now and uh just a few PER at um service now and uh just a few PER at um service now and uh just a few years ago we look at Fortune 500 status. years ago we look at Fortune 500 status. years ago we look at Fortune 500 status. So the theme of all this is not only are So the theme of all this is not only are So the theme of all this is not only are we learning but uh we're learning as we we learning but uh we're learning as we we learning but uh we're learning as we as we speak through it. So thank you as we speak through it. So thank you as we speak through it. So thank you everyone again for um for attending everyone again for um for attending everyone again for um for attending this. I I was curious about the this. I I was curious about the this. I I was curious about the audience. How many other folks are audience. How many other folks are audience. How many other folks are inerts or I guess never have been. Okay inerts or I guess never have been. Okay inerts or I guess never have been. Okay that's solid. Nice. Yeah you weren't that's solid. Nice. Yeah you weren't that's solid. Nice. Yeah you weren't kidding about that. Um cool. So uh kidding about that. Um cool. So uh kidding about that. Um cool. So uh really appreciate that. really appreciate that. really appreciate that. So, so for me, originally started as a So, so for me, originally started as a So, so for me, originally started as a web app developer, always liked security web app developer, always liked security web app developer, always liked security more though. So, I was able to get into more though. So, I was able to get into more though. So, I was able to get into uh security research. Um, and I'll talk uh security research. Um, and I'll talk uh security research. Um, and I'll talk about it in a little bit, but I was able about it in a little bit, but I was able about it in a little bit, but I was able also to be an apps educator working with also to be an apps educator working with also to be an apps educator working with developers. Um, I got coached to start developers. Um, I got coached to start developers. Um, I got coached to start Service Now's PERT about two and a half Service Now's PERT about two and a half Service Now's PERT about two and a half years ago. um service now had a bounty years ago. um service now had a bounty years ago. um service now had a bounty program and has a responsible program in program and has a responsible program in program and has a responsible program in the BD um as well and all that needed the BD um as well and all that needed the BD um as well and all that needed like an official house and an official like an official house and an official like an official house and an official team. So joined two and a half years ago team. So joined two and a half years ago team. So joined two and a half years ago to start that um turned to first to start that um turned to first to start that um turned to first framework. It wasn't my first rodeo framework. It wasn't my first rodeo framework. It wasn't my first rodeo through but to actually like organize through but to actually like organize through but to actually like organize our growth turned to the services our growth turned to the services our growth turned to the services framework and said here's where started. framework and said here's where started. framework and said here's where started. Uh we're up to 12 engineers and on three Uh we're up to 12 engineers and on three Uh we're up to 12 engineers and on three continents right now. So, uh, we're a continents right now. So, uh, we're a continents right now. So, uh, we're a CNA. We're a member of first.org. I'm CNA. We're a member of first.org. I'm CNA. We're a member of first.org. I'm also an MBA student. Um, about halfway also an MBA student. Um, about halfway also an MBA student. Um, about halfway through that during nights and weekends. through that during nights and weekends. through that during nights and weekends. Um, before joining Surface Um, before joining Surface Um, before joining Surface Now, two experiences being in CNA. One, Now, two experiences being in CNA. One, Now, two experiences being in CNA. One, uh, a researcher CNA myself, another one uh, a researcher CNA myself, another one uh, a researcher CNA myself, another one at at first, uh, Force at at first, uh, Force at at first, uh, Force Point. Again, at Force Point, we were in Point. Again, at Force Point, we were in Point. Again, at Force Point, we were in first.org. Also been at Octa, Invincia, first.org. Also been at Octa, Invincia, first.org. Also been at Octa, Invincia, some G contractors. Um and then for the some G contractors. Um and then for the some G contractors. Um and then for the the bit of free time I have I I did a the bit of free time I have I I did a the bit of free time I have I I did a lot of search and rescue for like six or lot of search and rescue for like six or lot of search and rescue for like six or seven years and then just ran out of seven years and then just ran out of seven years and then just ran out of free time. So the takeaway for uh for free time. So the takeaway for uh for free time. So the takeaway for uh for the bio um at least for this slide is my the bio um at least for this slide is my the bio um at least for this slide is my experiences over time at tech companies experiences over time at tech companies experiences over time at tech companies have gone from onrem to to hosted um have gone from onrem to to hosted um have gone from onrem to to hosted um just with the the trend of cloud uh and just with the the trend of cloud uh and just with the the trend of cloud uh and that's really where this perspective that's really where this perspective that's really where this perspective comes from. So long story short been in comes from. So long story short been in comes from. So long story short been in PERT since 2015. I was able to take um PERT since 2015. I was able to take um PERT since 2015. I was able to take um what I feel like is an 18month uh what I feel like is an 18month uh what I feel like is an 18month uh refresher at Octa where I got to work refresher at Octa where I got to work refresher at Octa where I got to work with developers actually get into like with developers actually get into like with developers actually get into like prevention and education like some of prevention and education like some of prevention and education like some of that early life cycle stuff. Uh I then that early life cycle stuff. Uh I then that early life cycle stuff. Uh I then got poached back into PERT land. Um and got poached back into PERT land. Um and got poached back into PERT land. Um and I think it's I think I like type two I think it's I think I like type two I think it's I think I like type two fun. I can explain that at the end if fun. I can explain that at the end if fun. I can explain that at the end if people have a question. Um but I think people have a question. Um but I think people have a question. Um but I think you know I thinkerts are are genuinely you know I thinkerts are are genuinely you know I thinkerts are are genuinely pretty exciting. So the premise for the pretty exciting. So the premise for the pretty exciting. So the premise for the talk is inserts at a SAS I feel like talk is inserts at a SAS I feel like talk is inserts at a SAS I feel like have some challenges and some have some challenges and some have some challenges and some opportunities that are different than opportunities that are different than opportunities that are different than those at a vendor who strictly makes those at a vendor who strictly makes those at a vendor who strictly makes on-prem software. Some of the challenges on-prem software. Some of the challenges on-prem software. Some of the challenges can be that your infrastructure that can be that your infrastructure that can be that your infrastructure that you're hosting for customers is arguably you're hosting for customers is arguably you're hosting for customers is arguably easily uh discoverable probably internet easily uh discoverable probably internet easily uh discoverable probably internet connected. Uh some opportunities though connected. Uh some opportunities though connected. Uh some opportunities though that come with that is you can uh you that come with that is you can uh you that come with that is you can uh you have some signals through detections and have some signals through detections and have some signals through detections and telemetry telemetry telemetry uh to maybe make some risk based uh to maybe make some risk based uh to maybe make some risk based decisions to say uh this issue needs to decisions to say uh this issue needs to decisions to say uh this issue needs to be fixed tonight and it needs to be be fixed tonight and it needs to be be fixed tonight and it needs to be fixed next week like kind of how much fixed next week like kind of how much fixed next week like kind of how much time you have and how disruptive are you time you have and how disruptive are you time you have and how disruptive are you going to be to the business. So for going to be to the business. So for going to be to the business. So for agenda what we will cover is risk agenda what we will cover is risk agenda what we will cover is risk factors. We'll cover a bit about hosted factors. We'll cover a bit about hosted factors. We'll cover a bit about hosted and onrem. Uh challenges I try not to be and onrem. Uh challenges I try not to be and onrem. Uh challenges I try not to be too negative but challenges are probably too negative but challenges are probably too negative but challenges are probably about 70% of the presentation with about 70% of the presentation with about 70% of the presentation with opportunities being about 30. Uh I I can opportunities being about 30. Uh I I can opportunities being about 30. Uh I I can give advice so a lot of these are just give advice so a lot of these are just give advice so a lot of these are just things to think about or I present maybe things to think about or I present maybe things to think about or I present maybe two schools of thought even if one is two schools of thought even if one is two schools of thought even if one is really silly. You might be like that's really silly. You might be like that's really silly. You might be like that's dumb. I'm going to give you both. Uh I'm dumb. I'm going to give you both. Uh I'm dumb. I'm going to give you both. Uh I'm not a lawyer. These these are of course not a lawyer. These these are of course not a lawyer. These these are of course my own views. uh your situation's likely my own views. uh your situation's likely my own views. uh your situation's likely very different. And to be honest, my very different. And to be honest, my very different. And to be honest, my advice is probably pretty bad anyway. advice is probably pretty bad anyway. advice is probably pretty bad anyway. So, listen, I'll take it. Um the biggest So, listen, I'll take it. Um the biggest So, listen, I'll take it. Um the biggest risk factor for me when I was thinking risk factor for me when I was thinking risk factor for me when I was thinking about this presentation is like the about this presentation is like the about this presentation is like the speed of attack service discovery, speed of attack service discovery, speed of attack service discovery, right? You know, you've got um you're right? You know, you've got um you're right? You know, you've got um you're hosting for customers. You want them to hosting for customers. You want them to hosting for customers. You want them to easily get to uh get to the software easily get to uh get to the software easily get to uh get to the software that you're billing them for. And uh of that you're billing them for. And uh of that you're billing them for. And uh of course that also means researchers and course that also means researchers and course that also means researchers and doctors have probably just as easy doctors have probably just as easy doctors have probably just as easy convenient access to it. Um some people convenient access to it. Um some people convenient access to it. Um some people choose to host uh customers as choose to host uh customers as choose to host uh customers as subdomains of like company.com or subdomains of like company.com or subdomains of like company.com or whatever can be super convenient. I'm whatever can be super convenient. I'm whatever can be super convenient. I'm not saying get away from that like using not saying get away from that like using not saying get away from that like using that getting away from that as a metric that getting away from that as a metric that getting away from that as a metric of security would just be obscurity. So of security would just be obscurity. So of security would just be obscurity. So don't worry about that. But it can lead don't worry about that. But it can lead don't worry about that. But it can lead to interesting things like fast to interesting things like fast to interesting things like fast enumeration of other customers. And if enumeration of other customers. And if enumeration of other customers. And if you have customers who are doing pen you have customers who are doing pen you have customers who are doing pen tests on what they think is their own tests on what they think is their own tests on what they think is their own scope, they accidentally might mess up scope, they accidentally might mess up scope, they accidentally might mess up scope, start pentesting other scope, start pentesting other scope, start pentesting other customers. Some more things to um to customers. Some more things to um to customers. Some more things to um to think about are kind of that that speed think about are kind of that that speed think about are kind of that that speed of of the uh learning curve for of of the uh learning curve for of of the uh learning curve for researchers. It's my opinion that at researchers. It's my opinion that at researchers. It's my opinion that at least to get to that point where least to get to that point where least to get to that point where researcher can find basic web researcher can find basic web researcher can find basic web vulnerabilities is pretty fast. Like vulnerabilities is pretty fast. Like vulnerabilities is pretty fast. Like you're not reversing malware. I don't you're not reversing malware. I don't you're not reversing malware. I don't know how to mess with the chipset, like know how to mess with the chipset, like know how to mess with the chipset, like that sort of that sort of that sort of thing. The software is easily thing. The software is easily thing. The software is easily accessible. It might be free or might accessible. It might be free or might accessible. It might be free or might have some sort of soft payw wall or have some sort of soft payw wall or have some sort of soft payw wall or trial where it's instantly ready. I trial where it's instantly ready. I trial where it's instantly ready. I don't have to go set up servers. Maybe don't have to go set up servers. Maybe don't have to go set up servers. Maybe just sign up with an email address and just sign up with an email address and just sign up with an email address and uh you know with a laptop, maybe some uh you know with a laptop, maybe some uh you know with a laptop, maybe some free software, maybe even just a free software, maybe even just a free software, maybe even just a browser, you can start pentesting web browser, you can start pentesting web browser, you can start pentesting web apps. apps. apps. So and the source risk factors when it So and the source risk factors when it So and the source risk factors when it comes to the target again internet comes to the target again internet comes to the target again internet connected which means can't be within connected which means can't be within connected which means can't be within some some customers feel the lockdown some some customers feel the lockdown some some customers feel the lockdown environment less defense and depth there environment less defense and depth there environment less defense and depth there so you lose a layer also I feel like the so you lose a layer also I feel like the so you lose a layer also I feel like the stakes are higher because with CBSS stakes are higher because with CBSS stakes are higher because with CBSS every time I'm running the calculator to every time I'm running the calculator to every time I'm running the calculator to talk about vulnerability or issue with talk about vulnerability or issue with talk about vulnerability or issue with CP attack vector consistently is network CP attack vector consistently is network CP attack vector consistently is network which is is the highest for that input which is is the highest for that input which is is the highest for that input uh so I just feel that the severity of uh so I just feel that the severity of uh so I just feel that the severity of of vulnerabilities and as impass, you of vulnerabilities and as impass, you of vulnerabilities and as impass, you know, at least from that limited know, at least from that limited know, at least from that limited perspective, start out pretty high. And perspective, start out pretty high. And perspective, start out pretty high. And then ingress and egress requirements, then ingress and egress requirements, then ingress and egress requirements, you don't always know what your customer you don't always know what your customer you don't always know what your customer does and doesn't want to have their does and doesn't want to have their does and doesn't want to have their service talked to or be reachable from. service talked to or be reachable from. service talked to or be reachable from. So you may not be able to implement much So you may not be able to implement much So you may not be able to implement much of a opinion on services that that of a opinion on services that that of a opinion on services that that should be blocked. So in other words, should be blocked. So in other words, should be blocked. So in other words, the stakes are really high. And uh the stakes are really high. And uh the stakes are really high. And uh welcome to the show. welcome to the show. welcome to the show. So to me cloud doesn't just uh it So to me cloud doesn't just uh it So to me cloud doesn't just uh it doesn't mean hands off as a customer doesn't mean hands off as a customer doesn't mean hands off as a customer like I bought your stuff and I have no like I bought your stuff and I have no like I bought your stuff and I have no further responsibility when it comes to further responsibility when it comes to further responsibility when it comes to the the security of what I purchased the the security of what I purchased the the security of what I purchased from you. from you. from you. So there is I I won't let you on the So there is I I won't let you on the So there is I I won't let you on the shared responsibility model that's kind shared responsibility model that's kind shared responsibility model that's kind of snoozefest but um you can think about of snoozefest but um you can think about of snoozefest but um you can think about the shared responsibility model you the shared responsibility model you the shared responsibility model you could think about customer risk based could think about customer risk based could think about customer risk based decision- making whether they um the decision- making whether they um the decision- making whether they um the part they may play is based on the part they may play is based on the part they may play is based on the information the vendor gives out. uh information the vendor gives out. uh information the vendor gives out. uh does that um customer need to apply a does that um customer need to apply a does that um customer need to apply a patch faster than maybe even like a patch faster than maybe even like a patch faster than maybe even like a monthly patching automated cadence? Uh monthly patching automated cadence? Uh monthly patching automated cadence? Uh do they need to do and apply some inter do they need to do and apply some inter do they need to do and apply some inter mitigations? Uh unfortunately a lot of mitigations? Uh unfortunately a lot of mitigations? Uh unfortunately a lot of these situations and realities and these situations and realities and these situations and realities and expectations uh get tested during um a expectations uh get tested during um a expectations uh get tested during um a crisis which is when some customers may crisis which is when some customers may crisis which is when some customers may realize a little late that um they do realize a little late that um they do realize a little late that um they do play a part that communications from the play a part that communications from the play a part that communications from the vendor and stuff like that are are vendor and stuff like that are are vendor and stuff like that are are pretty pretty pretty important. Another challenge is important. Another challenge is important. Another challenge is visibility or telemetry. So, another visibility or telemetry. So, another visibility or telemetry. So, another thing customers might be surprised about thing customers might be surprised about thing customers might be surprised about during or or after a uh a crisis, they during or or after a uh a crisis, they during or or after a uh a crisis, they may ask the vendor, hey, was was I may ask the vendor, hey, was was I may ask the vendor, hey, was was I breached? Which is like a pretty pretty breached? Which is like a pretty pretty breached? Which is like a pretty pretty hot question. Um the vendor may hot question. Um the vendor may hot question. Um the vendor may absolutely not have visibility into the absolutely not have visibility into the absolutely not have visibility into the request and response like on purpose. Uh request and response like on purpose. Uh request and response like on purpose. Uh it may be an absolute liability. It may it may be an absolute liability. It may it may be an absolute liability. It may be in the contracts that hey, we don't be in the contracts that hey, we don't be in the contracts that hey, we don't want to mess with your your data either want to mess with your your data either want to mess with your your data either transit or rest. We have no idea. Uh so transit or rest. We have no idea. Uh so transit or rest. We have no idea. Uh so some of the customers are let down some of the customers are let down some of the customers are let down there. Um and I hope that doesn't come there. Um and I hope that doesn't come there. Um and I hope that doesn't come across as like a surprise with even the across as like a surprise with even the across as like a surprise with even the customers you know during or after an customers you know during or after an customers you know during or after an incident. Uh and therefore the vendor incident. Uh and therefore the vendor incident. Uh and therefore the vendor just is not at all in a position to to just is not at all in a position to to just is not at all in a position to to advise on whether a breach if you want advise on whether a breach if you want advise on whether a breach if you want to use the official word or a data leak to use the official word or a data leak to use the official word or a data leak occurred. You may say hey throw web occurred. You may say hey throw web occurred. You may say hey throw web firewall in front of it and call it a firewall in front of it and call it a firewall in front of it and call it a day. day. day. um it would be awesome, but that may um it would be awesome, but that may um it would be awesome, but that may break either universally all of your break either universally all of your break either universally all of your customers or it may break, oddly enough, customers or it may break, oddly enough, customers or it may break, oddly enough, just some of them. And so that that gets just some of them. And so that that gets just some of them. And so that that gets a little a little tricky. Again, the a little a little tricky. Again, the a little a little tricky. Again, the more customizable your software, more customizable your software, more customizable your software, arguably, the more things that could go arguably, the more things that could go arguably, the more things that could go wrong for, you know, a subset of your wrong for, you know, a subset of your wrong for, you know, a subset of your folks. Uh some customers, their their folks. Uh some customers, their their folks. Uh some customers, their their preferences change. Some would say, "I'd preferences change. Some would say, "I'd preferences change. Some would say, "I'd rather have the downtime and need you to rather have the downtime and need you to rather have the downtime and need you to break my system overnight or 12 hours or break my system overnight or 12 hours or break my system overnight or 12 hours or whatever it is than to risk any sort of whatever it is than to risk any sort of whatever it is than to risk any sort of breach." Um, some customers uptime is breach." Um, some customers uptime is breach." Um, some customers uptime is super variable and, uh, they do not want super variable and, uh, they do not want super variable and, uh, they do not want to take them down no matter what. You to take them down no matter what. You to take them down no matter what. You kind of can't win there. There's not kind of can't win there. There's not kind of can't win there. There's not very single answer. Uh, you also have to very single answer. Uh, you also have to very single answer. Uh, you also have to think about how much downtime might I think about how much downtime might I think about how much downtime might I pause before I have at least like an pause before I have at least like an pause before I have at least like an interim mitigation in place. interim mitigation in place. interim mitigation in place. You may say, "Hey, throw some rate You may say, "Hey, throw some rate You may say, "Hey, throw some rate limiting on it." But you'd be surprised limiting on it." But you'd be surprised limiting on it." But you'd be surprised like 90 95% of your customers may just like 90 95% of your customers may just like 90 95% of your customers may just access your software as if they were a access your software as if they were a access your software as if they were a human. Some some have like may have human. Some some have like may have human. Some some have like may have automated jobs that fall down tons of uh automated jobs that fall down tons of uh automated jobs that fall down tons of uh downloads, do a lot of uploads. Uh you downloads, do a lot of uploads. Uh you downloads, do a lot of uploads. Uh you might be surprised that you just without might be surprised that you just without might be surprised that you just without looking at people's like traffic levels looking at people's like traffic levels looking at people's like traffic levels to say, "Hey, rate limiting. This is to say, "Hey, rate limiting. This is to say, "Hey, rate limiting. This is what I think is the same level." and you what I think is the same level." and you what I think is the same level." and you start to bring some of your customers start to bring some of your customers start to bring some of your customers like in automated jobs and hosting like in automated jobs and hosting like in automated jobs and hosting providers do not have unlimited capacity providers do not have unlimited capacity providers do not have unlimited capacity inst um everything has a limit I think inst um everything has a limit I think inst um everything has a limit I think we're able to keep you know as as an we're able to keep you know as as an we're able to keep you know as as an industry keep building up and up our our industry keep building up and up our our industry keep building up and up our our capabilities but they're capabilities but they're capabilities but they're not not not so when it comes to disclosures um and so when it comes to disclosures um and so when it comes to disclosures um and I've been around CNAs and been reading I've been around CNAs and been reading I've been around CNAs and been reading CNA rules for for quite some time so CNA rules for for quite some time so CNA rules for for quite some time so I'll present you know a couple I'll present you know a couple I'll present you know a couple perspectives it was not necessarily just perspectives it was not necessarily just perspectives it was not necessarily just my own, but you can argue, you know, if my own, but you can argue, you know, if my own, but you can argue, you know, if a customer didn't have to take an a customer didn't have to take an a customer didn't have to take an action, should I bother getting out of action, should I bother getting out of action, should I bother getting out of CDE or is it just noise and a customer CDE or is it just noise and a customer CDE or is it just noise and a customer is probably like, "Hey, thanks for is probably like, "Hey, thanks for is probably like, "Hey, thanks for handling it. Why why bother telling you handling it. Why why bother telling you handling it. Why why bother telling you about this?" Um, even about this?" Um, even about this?" Um, even if patched in your customers occurrences if patched in your customers occurrences if patched in your customers occurrences of the software you're you're providing of the software you're you're providing of the software you're you're providing them, but patching is happening them, but patching is happening them, but patching is happening automatically, maybe monthly, some sort automatically, maybe monthly, some sort automatically, maybe monthly, some sort of automation. did they have to do of automation. did they have to do of automation. did they have to do anything? But to me, there's still value anything? But to me, there's still value anything? But to me, there's still value in uh disclosures because if if I have a in uh disclosures because if if I have a in uh disclosures because if if I have a customer or if I have a patching cadence customer or if I have a patching cadence customer or if I have a patching cadence that at the end of April, customers will that at the end of April, customers will that at the end of April, customers will automatically be patched, but some may automatically be patched, but some may automatically be patched, but some may say, "Hey, um I want to patch, you know, say, "Hey, um I want to patch, you know, say, "Hey, um I want to patch, you know, today uh based on information you gave today uh based on information you gave today uh based on information you gave me. Um I want to go ahead and opt into me. Um I want to go ahead and opt into me. Um I want to go ahead and opt into uh uh uh to as soon as possible." uh how soon to to as soon as possible." uh how soon to to as soon as possible." uh how soon to publish a CDE assuming you're like yeah publish a CDE assuming you're like yeah publish a CDE assuming you're like yeah we're going to do one uh that even can we're going to do one uh that even can we're going to do one uh that even can be subject to debate. So be subject to debate. So be subject to debate. So um one school of thought is release the um one school of thought is release the um one school of thought is release the patch maybe have a notion of hey there's patch maybe have a notion of hey there's patch maybe have a notion of hey there's some security fixes in these release some security fixes in these release some security fixes in these release notes uh and give notes uh and give notes uh and give customers a amount of time to apply the customers a amount of time to apply the customers a amount of time to apply the patch right so some customers they may patch right so some customers they may patch right so some customers they may say hey I want 6 months 12 months like say hey I want 6 months 12 months like say hey I want 6 months 12 months like you're probably not going to be able to you're probably not going to be able to you're probably not going to be able to accommodate that but do you give them a accommodate that but do you give them a accommodate that but do you give them a month and then later the full CP details month and then later the full CP details month and then later the full CP details um the assumption there is that CPE and um the assumption there is that CPE and um the assumption there is that CPE and all details draw a lot of research or all details draw a lot of research or all details draw a lot of research or attention for like follow on research attention for like follow on research attention for like follow on research work. Um, but I've also heard another work. Um, but I've also heard another work. Um, but I've also heard another school of thought where some customers school of thought where some customers school of thought where some customers are highly driven by only what are highly driven by only what are highly driven by only what management tools are telling them. So if management tools are telling them. So if management tools are telling them. So if there's no CDP, they don't even like there's no CDP, they don't even like there's no CDP, they don't even like their clock doesn't start. They don't their clock doesn't start. They don't their clock doesn't start. They don't even pay attention to it. So you can end even pay attention to it. So you can end even pay attention to it. So you can end up in a condition where you're watching up in a condition where you're watching up in a condition where you're watching like a little progress bar of customers like a little progress bar of customers like a little progress bar of customers adopting patches and then that last bit adopting patches and then that last bit adopting patches and then that last bit like they're just never getting there. like they're just never getting there. like they're just never getting there. Why? And so um it could be those those Why? And so um it could be those those Why? And so um it could be those those holdouts are waiting for their tooling holdouts are waiting for their tooling holdouts are waiting for their tooling to say hey there's an issue here. You to say hey there's an issue here. You to say hey there's an issue here. You know the the clock starts start to exit. know the the clock starts start to exit. know the the clock starts start to exit. Um and again at thousands of customers Um and again at thousands of customers Um and again at thousands of customers um as your situation scales I would say um as your situation scales I would say um as your situation scales I would say embargo is complex. I don't want to use embargo is complex. I don't want to use embargo is complex. I don't want to use the word impossible. I would just say I the word impossible. I would just say I the word impossible. I would just say I haven't attempted it. And each of those haven't attempted it. And each of those haven't attempted it. And each of those customers can have one or more staff customers can have one or more staff customers can have one or more staff depending on the size of your customer. depending on the size of your customer. depending on the size of your customer. Uh some other challenges are trying to Uh some other challenges are trying to Uh some other challenges are trying to figure out customer intent. figure out customer intent. figure out customer intent. So did the customer intend to set up So did the customer intend to set up So did the customer intend to set up their system their you know your really their system their you know your really their system their you know your really powerful highly complex software. Did powerful highly complex software. Did powerful highly complex software. Did they intend to set it up that way? Um do they intend to set it up that way? Um do they intend to set it up that way? Um do they know they have it set up that way? they know they have it set up that way? they know they have it set up that way? and uh you know maybe an employee or a and uh you know maybe an employee or a and uh you know maybe an employee or a consultant came in 10 years ago, set up consultant came in 10 years ago, set up consultant came in 10 years ago, set up the platform for them and then you know the platform for them and then you know the platform for them and then you know you've got new staff in place and they you've got new staff in place and they you've got new staff in place and they have no idea that something was set up have no idea that something was set up have no idea that something was set up as it was you know 10 or so years ago as it was you know 10 or so years ago as it was you know 10 or so years ago right and then have people accidentally right and then have people accidentally right and then have people accidentally and I I truly mean accidentally built on and I I truly mean accidentally built on and I I truly mean accidentally built on top top top of a lack of security and it just works of a lack of security and it just works of a lack of security and it just works and then you changing some underlying and then you changing some underlying and then you changing some underlying behavior is going to break behavior is going to break behavior is going to break them and you may not even know that in them and you may not even know that in them and you may not even know that in advance um without the customer getting advance um without the customer getting advance um without the customer getting hands on and doing their own hands on and doing their own hands on and doing their own testing more about intentions and and testing more about intentions and and testing more about intentions and and their challenges. Breaking changes or their challenges. Breaking changes or their challenges. Breaking changes or changing some of the fundamental changing some of the fundamental changing some of the fundamental behavior of that underlying platform in behavior of that underlying platform in behavior of that underlying platform in my mind can have a multi-rain model. I my mind can have a multi-rain model. I my mind can have a multi-rain model. I chose chose chose three at the top level the vendor's three at the top level the vendor's three at the top level the vendor's responsibility is to change the responsibility is to change the responsibility is to change the underlying behavior of the platform um underlying behavior of the platform um underlying behavior of the platform um of the software they make because it's of the software they make because it's of the software they make because it's pretty straightforward. If they also pretty straightforward. If they also pretty straightforward. If they also sell you applications built on that sell you applications built on that sell you applications built on that platform made available to you as SAS, platform made available to you as SAS, platform made available to you as SAS, uh that vendor probably also has to make uh that vendor probably also has to make uh that vendor probably also has to make sure the apps didn't break from that sure the apps didn't break from that sure the apps didn't break from that underlying change in the platform. And underlying change in the platform. And underlying change in the platform. And either as a third ring or kind of at the either as a third ring or kind of at the either as a third ring or kind of at the same time as that second ring, you may same time as that second ring, you may same time as that second ring, you may have yourself if you put your customer have yourself if you put your customer have yourself if you put your customer hat on or um if you're like an hat on or um if you're like an hat on or um if you're like an implementation partner, they may start implementation partner, they may start implementation partner, they may start to write their own code um and follow to write their own code um and follow to write their own code um and follow some of the same practices that your some of the same practices that your some of the same practices that your internal devs do, but that underlying internal devs do, but that underlying internal devs do, but that underlying behavior may may break even in their own behavior may may break even in their own behavior may may break even in their own code. So, putting back my educator hat code. So, putting back my educator hat code. So, putting back my educator hat on for a second, I was like, "All right, on for a second, I was like, "All right, on for a second, I was like, "All right, I got like three or more different I got like three or more different I got like three or more different personas of of developer audiences to uh personas of of developer audiences to uh personas of of developer audiences to uh to work with. Um, we've got a timing to work with. Um, we've got a timing to work with. Um, we've got a timing thing. You know, we're going to like thing. You know, we're going to like thing. You know, we're going to like roll out some of these changes. Um, roll out some of these changes. Um, roll out some of these changes. Um, there's just a lot to what happens if there's just a lot to what happens if there's just a lot to what happens if you have to change uh some fundamental you have to change uh some fundamental you have to change uh some fundamental behavior of that platform you make. um behavior of that platform you make. um behavior of that platform you make. um you may be able to try to you may be able to try to you may be able to try to judge how much software on the judge how much software on the judge how much software on the customer's side that you're confident customer's side that you're confident customer's side that you're confident you can fix yourself and and you could you can fix yourself and and you could you can fix yourself and and you could be you could possibly be highly be you could possibly be highly be you could possibly be highly confident if I gave someone a copy of confident if I gave someone a copy of confident if I gave someone a copy of the file um the check sum still is the the file um the check sum still is the the file um the check sum still is the check sum that um you know is the same check sum that um you know is the same check sum that um you know is the same as what's on my side unlike a throwing as what's on my side unlike a throwing as what's on my side unlike a throwing awayation concerns for a second like awayation concerns for a second like awayation concerns for a second like that file hasn't been modified. So I that file hasn't been modified. So I that file hasn't been modified. So I feel like I have to swap out this feel like I have to swap out this feel like I have to swap out this function that's in there. Um this will function that's in there. Um this will function that's in there. Um this will totally work. We can maybe immediately totally work. We can maybe immediately totally work. We can maybe immediately fix things for the customer. That's fix things for the customer. That's fix things for the customer. That's awesome. Uh problem is even your awesome. Uh problem is even your awesome. Uh problem is even your confidence in that may start to uh confidence in that may start to uh confidence in that may start to uh diminish if even like a single character diminish if even like a single character diminish if even like a single character that file has been changed. You're like that file has been changed. You're like that file has been changed. You're like man this check signs off. man this check signs off. man this check signs off. Um, do we want a chance modifying what Um, do we want a chance modifying what Um, do we want a chance modifying what is now like customerowned and modified is now like customerowned and modified is now like customerowned and modified files for them? And you may also as the files for them? And you may also as the files for them? And you may also as the uh as the host of your customers, you uh as the host of your customers, you uh as the host of your customers, you may end up in a position where an may end up in a position where an may end up in a position where an internet service is like, hey, your internet service is like, hey, your internet service is like, hey, your infrastructure is abusing infrastructure is abusing infrastructure is abusing mine. What are you going to do about it? mine. What are you going to do about it? mine. What are you going to do about it? So you get the uh the responsibility of So you get the uh the responsibility of So you get the uh the responsibility of kind of being that u the referee between kind of being that u the referee between kind of being that u the referee between uh what a customer software is doing and uh what a customer software is doing and uh what a customer software is doing and and maybe paying way too often some and maybe paying way too often some and maybe paying way too often some outside internet outside internet outside internet services. Another challenge I'd like to services. Another challenge I'd like to services. Another challenge I'd like to categorize is as enablement. categorize is as enablement. categorize is as enablement. So as probably a pretty biased security So as probably a pretty biased security So as probably a pretty biased security community here, we want to ship things community here, we want to ship things community here, we want to ship things as secure as possible like full stop. as secure as possible like full stop. as secure as possible like full stop. But the reality is people may have like But the reality is people may have like But the reality is people may have like business use cases that have been around business use cases that have been around business use cases that have been around for a while and they don't yet they're for a while and they don't yet they're for a while and they don't yet they're not ready for like 2A or they're not not ready for like 2A or they're not not ready for like 2A or they're not ready for like the latest and greatest ready for like the latest and greatest ready for like the latest and greatest ciphers and something. And so as a ciphers and something. And so as a ciphers and something. And so as a vendor you're challenged where you're vendor you're challenged where you're vendor you're challenged where you're like all right so we're going to ship like all right so we're going to ship like all right so we're going to ship things in secure way but we are going to things in secure way but we are going to things in secure way but we are going to have to give people the option to back have to give people the option to back have to give people the option to back that down if they want. that down if they want. that down if they want. And in the court of public opinion, when And in the court of public opinion, when And in the court of public opinion, when that customer um it's it's breached, that customer um it's it's breached, that customer um it's it's breached, it's still your brand that shows up in it's still your brand that shows up in it's still your brand that shows up in the news, unfortunately. And you can't the news, unfortunately. And you can't the news, unfortunately. And you can't go out and then like totally drag your go out and then like totally drag your go out and then like totally drag your customer and be like, "Ah, it's their customer and be like, "Ah, it's their customer and be like, "Ah, it's their fault." Like you just I don't see this fault." Like you just I don't see this fault." Like you just I don't see this as like there's no win coming out of as like there's no win coming out of as like there's no win coming out of this. And and that's unfortunate is like this. And and that's unfortunate is like this. And and that's unfortunate is like you're trying to ship secure, you feel you're trying to ship secure, you feel you're trying to ship secure, you feel obligated to give, you know, lesser obligated to give, you know, lesser obligated to give, you know, lesser options. uh someone takes you up on options. uh someone takes you up on options. uh someone takes you up on those something bad happens your brand those something bad happens your brand those something bad happens your brand is still on the is still on the is still on the news. Another challenge could be news. Another challenge could be news. Another challenge could be communication failures. So communication failures. So communication failures. So uh problems that can come up are you uh problems that can come up are you uh problems that can come up are you have contact info for your customers. have contact info for your customers. have contact info for your customers. They have a security team or security They have a security team or security They have a security team or security contact and that is no longer current. contact and that is no longer current. contact and that is no longer current. It's not tied in with AM or something It's not tied in with AM or something It's not tied in with AM or something and so you're essentially automatically and so you're essentially automatically and so you're essentially automatically emailing no one. Um we're all candidates emailing no one. Um we're all candidates emailing no one. Um we're all candidates we take time off. we take time off. we take time off. So sometimes a the person who's listed So sometimes a the person who's listed So sometimes a the person who's listed may not have listed a backup contact for may not have listed a backup contact for may not have listed a backup contact for that super critical uh communication you that super critical uh communication you that super critical uh communication you really would like them to see like today really would like them to see like today really would like them to see like today or tomorrow or as this week. Uh an or tomorrow or as this week. Uh an or tomorrow or as this week. Uh an interesting other thing uh is the interesting other thing uh is the interesting other thing uh is the possibility at larger and larger possibility at larger and larger possibility at larger and larger organizations that the security team and organizations that the security team and organizations that the security team and the maintenance team for the software the maintenance team for the software the maintenance team for the software you provide are different. you provide are different. you provide are different. um a maintenance team may see the um a maintenance team may see the um a maintenance team may see the evidence be like okay and then like evidence be like okay and then like evidence be like okay and then like later once you issue CPD security team later once you issue CPD security team later once you issue CPD security team that's running B management tools might that's running B management tools might that's running B management tools might be like why in the world is this still be like why in the world is this still be like why in the world is this still around you were told about this 60 days around you were told about this 60 days around you were told about this 60 days ago so let them fight that out but just ago so let them fight that out but just ago so let them fight that out but just know that the folks in your messaging know that the folks in your messaging know that the folks in your messaging may not always be the one that really may not always be the one that really may not always be the one that really needs to advocate for the really quick needs to advocate for the really quick needs to advocate for the really quick fixes of things and then you also get fixes of things and then you also get fixes of things and then you also get into if you have an ecosystem around into if you have an ecosystem around into if you have an ecosystem around around your company of like around your company of like around your company of like implementation partners um hosts implementation partners um hosts implementation partners um hosts uh whatever it is uh sometimes the uh whatever it is uh sometimes the uh whatever it is uh sometimes the message doesn't get to that end customer message doesn't get to that end customer message doesn't get to that end customer listener about something. So there that listener about something. So there that listener about something. So there that implementation partner might be totally implementation partner might be totally implementation partner might be totally asleep not paying attention your your asleep not paying attention your your asleep not paying attention your your security cons and it's unfortunate security cons and it's unfortunate security cons and it's unfortunate because what is technically their because what is technically their because what is technically their customer but still a user of your customer but still a user of your customer but still a user of your software um at the very end is not it's software um at the very end is not it's software um at the very end is not it's not patched either. Another challenge either. Another challenge either. Another challenge is vegetable gets is vegetable gets is vegetable gets opportunities, but another challenge is opportunities, but another challenge is opportunities, but another challenge is um kind of this this premise of living um kind of this this premise of living um kind of this this premise of living off the land where uh someone can either off the land where uh someone can either off the land where uh someone can either maliciously or maybe by accident abuse maliciously or maybe by accident abuse maliciously or maybe by accident abuse really powerful features that you create really powerful features that you create really powerful features that you create um and market and that's the reason um and market and that's the reason um and market and that's the reason people arguably bought your software is people arguably bought your software is people arguably bought your software is it solves problems for them. Really, it solves problems for them. Really, it solves problems for them. Really, really complex problems. But you're the really complex problems. But you're the really complex problems. But you're the host. So things that are computationally host. So things that are computationally host. So things that are computationally intensive, you know, you get to put the intensive, you know, you get to put the intensive, you know, you get to put the bill unless you have some sort of shared bill unless you have some sort of shared bill unless you have some sort of shared shared billing model. Um this can again shared billing model. Um this can again shared billing model. Um this can again include abuse of external services. include abuse of external services. include abuse of external services. Remember the internet companies that Remember the internet companies that Remember the internet companies that might come to you and say what is going might come to you and say what is going might come to you and say what is going on here? Um and then I mentioned that a on here? Um and then I mentioned that a on here? Um and then I mentioned that a lot of this living off the land or just lot of this living off the land or just lot of this living off the land or just resource abuse or whatever it is might resource abuse or whatever it is might resource abuse or whatever it is might not even be malicious. it might be like not even be malicious. it might be like not even be malicious. it might be like really just poorly written code like really just poorly written code like really just poorly written code like loops that like non-stop and you're like loops that like non-stop and you're like loops that like non-stop and you're like uh it's like a 101 error right there. So uh it's like a 101 error right there. So uh it's like a 101 error right there. So um there is the possibility that not um there is the possibility that not um there is the possibility that not everything bad is is probably like everything bad is is probably like everything bad is is probably like malicious uh causes. So another So another So another challenge is that hosted providers are challenge is that hosted providers are challenge is that hosted providers are not only responsible for that product or not only responsible for that product or not only responsible for that product or that do software that they sell you but that do software that they sell you but that do software that they sell you but also like everything underneath it. um also like everything underneath it. um also like everything underneath it. um also may end up your piece may end up also may end up your piece may end up also may end up your piece may end up involved in resolving vulnerabilities in involved in resolving vulnerabilities in involved in resolving vulnerabilities in just like the supporting infrastructure just like the supporting infrastructure just like the supporting infrastructure load balancers like backend services if load balancers like backend services if load balancers like backend services if you have like a you know AI services or you have like a you know AI services or you have like a you know AI services or identity or whatever it is identity or whatever it is identity or whatever it is storage you're responsible for all that storage you're responsible for all that storage you're responsible for all that uh as well and don't forget if you do uh as well and don't forget if you do uh as well and don't forget if you do have an on-prem business model where have an on-prem business model where have an on-prem business model where you're like hey we are like 99% hosted you're like hey we are like 99% hosted you're like hey we are like 99% hosted customer base, but we still have that customer base, but we still have that customer base, but we still have that one 1% who wants to like lock their one 1% who wants to like lock their one 1% who wants to like lock their software their own basement or whatever. software their own basement or whatever. software their own basement or whatever. Like you are giving out your software, Like you are giving out your software, Like you are giving out your software, obuscated or not, to outside parties. obuscated or not, to outside parties. obuscated or not, to outside parties. So, you can't just sit back and be like, So, you can't just sit back and be like, So, you can't just sit back and be like, "Hey, we're going to fix this thing. No "Hey, we're going to fix this thing. No "Hey, we're going to fix this thing. No one's ever going to know one's ever going to know one's ever going to know like that it was an issue." Um, or no like that it was an issue." Um, or no like that it was an issue." Um, or no one's going to understand this one's going to understand this one's going to understand this mitigation we put in place because no mitigation we put in place because no mitigation we put in place because no one's going to look at the patchets. And one's going to look at the patchets. And one's going to look at the patchets. And that's not true. um because one you may that's not true. um because one you may that's not true. um because one you may literally be like giving your software literally be like giving your software literally be like giving your software to people and the other is I've seen a to people and the other is I've seen a to people and the other is I've seen a few researchers um talk about how they few researchers um talk about how they few researchers um talk about how they like kind of social engineer or like like kind of social engineer or like like kind of social engineer or like tactically acquire software to then tactically acquire software to then tactically acquire software to then start reversing it um even if you're a start reversing it um even if you're a start reversing it um even if you're a purely hosted company. Now the challenge is what I just want to Now the challenge is what I just want to Now the challenge is what I just want to categorize is like steering just kind of categorize is like steering just kind of categorize is like steering just kind of made that made that up in this context made that made that up in this context made that made that up in this context but blocking the ability for uh but blocking the ability for uh but blocking the ability for uh customers to roll back to a vulnerable customers to roll back to a vulnerable customers to roll back to a vulnerable version again it's like an opinion right version again it's like an opinion right version again it's like an opinion right you're saying hey customers once you've you're saying hey customers once you've you're saying hey customers once you've moved to version 10 that no longer has moved to version 10 that no longer has moved to version 10 that no longer has the vulnerabilities in version 9 we're the vulnerabilities in version 9 we're the vulnerabilities in version 9 we're going to revoke your ability to ever going to revoke your ability to ever going to revoke your ability to ever create a new server with version 9 and create a new server with version 9 and create a new server with version 9 and um or take your production server that um or take your production server that um or take your production server that you rolled to 10 stuff broke. You can't you rolled to 10 stuff broke. You can't you rolled to 10 stuff broke. You can't can't roll it back to nine. So that is can't roll it back to nine. So that is can't roll it back to nine. So that is an opinion where you're saying on the an opinion where you're saying on the an opinion where you're saying on the customer's behalf um your breakage is customer's behalf um your breakage is customer's behalf um your breakage is less important than being reexposed to less important than being reexposed to less important than being reexposed to something that you fixed in version 10. something that you fixed in version 10. something that you fixed in version 10. Uh this can also this doesn't just have Uh this can also this doesn't just have Uh this can also this doesn't just have to be like platform level. This could to be like platform level. This could to be like platform level. This could also be if you're selling apps and you also be if you're selling apps and you also be if you're selling apps and you got an app store or something, you may got an app store or something, you may got an app store or something, you may revoke, you know, revoke, you know, revoke, you know, um, version 17 of some application that um, version 17 of some application that um, version 17 of some application that that you have for sale. Um, 18 is the that you have for sale. Um, 18 is the that you have for sale. Um, 18 is the newest. No one else can go find 17 and newest. No one else can go find 17 and newest. No one else can go find 17 and never install it again. So, the same never install it again. So, the same never install it again. So, the same sort of thing. Um, and you get into a sort of thing. Um, and you get into a sort of thing. Um, and you get into a judgment about what's a reasonable judgment about what's a reasonable judgment about what's a reasonable amount of so time for customers to test amount of so time for customers to test amount of so time for customers to test their changes, right? So, customers may their changes, right? So, customers may their changes, right? So, customers may be like, hey, I'm going to update my be like, hey, I'm going to update my be like, hey, I'm going to update my subro instances or subproduction subro instances or subproduction subro instances or subproduction instances. I want to go test this for instances. I want to go test this for instances. I want to go test this for like 30 days to see if it broke, you like 30 days to see if it broke, you like 30 days to see if it broke, you know, before before we roll it out in know, before before we roll it out in know, before before we roll it out in production. But again, you know, production. But again, you know, production. But again, you know, researcher from like the day to researcher from like the day to researcher from like the day to sometimes the day they told you about sometimes the day they told you about sometimes the day they told you about something, they want to go blog about it something, they want to go blog about it something, they want to go blog about it in like 90 days. That's fair game. But in like 90 days. That's fair game. But in like 90 days. That's fair game. But like you may have customers who want six like you may have customers who want six like you may have customers who want six to 12 months to test changes and you're to 12 months to test changes and you're to 12 months to test changes and you're not you're not going to make both happy. not you're not going to make both happy. not you're not going to make both happy. So just a heads up. So just a heads up. So just a heads up. We'll flip over to opportunities here. We'll flip over to opportunities here. We'll flip over to opportunities here. Um, again, it's it's definitely the Um, again, it's it's definitely the Um, again, it's it's definitely the smaller part of the presentation, but smaller part of the presentation, but smaller part of the presentation, but um, as as a host, you may um, as as a host, you may um, as as a host, you may also be hosting infrastructure that also be hosting infrastructure that also be hosting infrastructure that later kind of became helpful as a later kind of became helpful as a later kind of became helpful as a honeypot where you're like, oh, those honeypot where you're like, oh, those honeypot where you're like, oh, those were like demo instances. They have were like demo instances. They have were like demo instances. They have nothing important, but like people are nothing important, but like people are nothing important, but like people are scanning it and you're like, scanning it and you're like, scanning it and you're like, interesting. Like, okay. Um, kind of interesting. Like, okay. Um, kind of interesting. Like, okay. Um, kind of nice. And one funny potential scenario, nice. And one funny potential scenario, nice. And one funny potential scenario, it's up to you on on what to do about it's up to you on on what to do about it's up to you on on what to do about it, but let's say someone has scanned a it, but let's say someone has scanned a it, but let's say someone has scanned a ton of your infrastructure. They're ton of your infrastructure. They're ton of your infrastructure. They're like, man, I have all of this very like, man, I have all of this very like, man, I have all of this very valuable data, this data set. I'm going valuable data, this data set. I'm going valuable data, this data set. I'm going to go sell it forum and you're like to go sell it forum and you're like to go sell it forum and you're like questioning yourself. You're like, did questioning yourself. You're like, did questioning yourself. You're like, did we patch sufficient? Like, did we fix we patch sufficient? Like, did we fix we patch sufficient? Like, did we fix something? Do they know something we something? Do they know something we something? Do they know something we don't? Or the other outcome is you get don't? Or the other outcome is you get don't? Or the other outcome is you get your hands on a sample of that data or your hands on a sample of that data or your hands on a sample of that data or all that data and you find out it's it's all that data and you find out it's it's all that data and you find out it's it's all demo data from like your demo all demo data from like your demo all demo data from like your demo instances and you're like man that I instances and you're like man that I instances and you're like man that I hope no one buys this like it's terrible hope no one buys this like it's terrible hope no one buys this like it's terrible data. um up to you. You know, you can't data. um up to you. You know, you can't data. um up to you. You know, you can't really professionally go out and say, really professionally go out and say, really professionally go out and say, "Hey, this is, you know, this is federal "Hey, this is, you know, this is federal "Hey, this is, you know, this is federal junk and stuff, but um it may cause you junk and stuff, but um it may cause you junk and stuff, but um it may cause you and your incident response team to be and your incident response team to be and your incident response team to be like, hey, are we as sufficiently like, hey, are we as sufficiently like, hey, are we as sufficiently remediated or mediated as we thought?" remediated or mediated as we thought?" remediated or mediated as we thought?" Um at the end of the day, one thing you Um at the end of the day, one thing you Um at the end of the day, one thing you could think about is don't have your could think about is don't have your could think about is don't have your demo environments heavily lag on just demo environments heavily lag on just demo environments heavily lag on just that patching rig to do with customers, that patching rig to do with customers, that patching rig to do with customers, production instances. um maybe they're production instances. um maybe they're production instances. um maybe they're less important, but the problem is like less important, but the problem is like less important, but the problem is like if and when someone really enthusiastic if and when someone really enthusiastic if and when someone really enthusiastic breaks into one of those demo instances breaks into one of those demo instances breaks into one of those demo instances and then takes a screenshot and tweets and then takes a screenshot and tweets and then takes a screenshot and tweets about it, it's still again your vendor about it, it's still again your vendor about it, it's still again your vendor in the news causing causes concern, in the news causing causes concern, in the news causing causes concern, maybe get something to pick up and then maybe get something to pick up and then maybe get something to pick up and then you're in a position where you're like, you're in a position where you're like, you're in a position where you're like, hey, yeah, that's that's true, but like hey, yeah, that's that's true, but like hey, yeah, that's that's true, but like that's not an important instance. And that's not an important instance. And that's not an important instance. And you still look bad not patching you still look bad not patching you still look bad not patching everything. everything. everything. So another obser uh opportunity um is in So another obser uh opportunity um is in So another obser uh opportunity um is in observability. So no vulnerability is observability. So no vulnerability is observability. So no vulnerability is good but those that you're seeing what good but those that you're seeing what good but those that you're seeing what you think is exploit attempts uh is bad you think is exploit attempts uh is bad you think is exploit attempts uh is bad right? So or especially bad. So you can right? So or especially bad. So you can right? So or especially bad. So you can sometimes be a bit sane about what to sometimes be a bit sane about what to sometimes be a bit sane about what to accelerate a predefined remediation SLA accelerate a predefined remediation SLA accelerate a predefined remediation SLA about. So if you're like, hey, we fixed about. So if you're like, hey, we fixed about. So if you're like, hey, we fixed criticals in 15 days, um, but I'm seeing criticals in 15 days, um, but I'm seeing criticals in 15 days, um, but I'm seeing what looks like a ton of scanning what looks like a ton of scanning what looks like a ton of scanning activity. Do I totally disrupt that activity. Do I totally disrupt that activity. Do I totally disrupt that engineering group or business unit and engineering group or business unit and engineering group or business unit and say, "Hey, I'm sorry about those say, "Hey, I'm sorry about those say, "Hey, I'm sorry about those features that people are about to pay us features that people are about to pay us features that people are about to pay us for that we've, you know, marketed, but for that we've, you know, marketed, but for that we've, you know, marketed, but like I need, you know, you to consider like I need, you know, you to consider like I need, you know, you to consider this to be your your highest priority this to be your your highest priority this to be your your highest priority right now." right now." right now." So again, if you have um some amount of So again, if you have um some amount of So again, if you have um some amount of observability or can work with a team observability or can work with a team observability or can work with a team that does that does that does um again no bone is great or reason to um again no bone is great or reason to um again no bone is great or reason to get laz, but those where you're seeing a get laz, but those where you're seeing a get laz, but those where you're seeing a lot of scanning activity, you might be lot of scanning activity, you might be lot of scanning activity, you might be like, "All right, this is worth like, "All right, this is worth like, "All right, this is worth accelerating how quickly we fix this far accelerating how quickly we fix this far accelerating how quickly we fix this far in advance of what you know your normal in advance of what you know your normal in advance of what you know your normal SLAs are engineering." Uh some other SLAs are engineering." Uh some other SLAs are engineering." Uh some other cool observability stuff you might be cool observability stuff you might be cool observability stuff you might be able to do is say like hey able to do is say like hey able to do is say like hey um yeah so really terrible um yeah so really terrible um yeah so really terrible vulnerabilities in our software but it's vulnerabilities in our software but it's vulnerabilities in our software but it's only in the thing that's bleeding edge. only in the thing that's bleeding edge. only in the thing that's bleeding edge. We just made it last week like.1% of our We just made it last week like.1% of our We just made it last week like.1% of our customers are using it and they're just customers are using it and they're just customers are using it and they're just kind of triing it right now. So like kind of triing it right now. So like kind of triing it right now. So like yeah it's like a CVSS and it's like the yeah it's like a CVSS and it's like the yeah it's like a CVSS and it's like the worst thing ever. It's very severe. But worst thing ever. It's very severe. But worst thing ever. It's very severe. But you might feel like all right let's go you might feel like all right let's go you might feel like all right let's go measure the adoption of versions um in measure the adoption of versions um in measure the adoption of versions um in the wild of our our platform. Um are the wild of our our platform. Um are the wild of our our platform. Um are people even on that bleeding edge thing? people even on that bleeding edge thing? people even on that bleeding edge thing? Maybe not. Um is the vulnerability in Maybe not. Um is the vulnerability in Maybe not. Um is the vulnerability in the thing that's going that everyone is the thing that's going that everyone is the thing that's going that everyone is rolling off of in the next like 15 days rolling off of in the next like 15 days rolling off of in the next like 15 days anyway just because keeping up with anyway just because keeping up with anyway just because keeping up with current versions maybe. Um, even if that current versions maybe. Um, even if that current versions maybe. Um, even if that underlying software is on a version that underlying software is on a version that underlying software is on a version that has the vulnerability, if it depends on has the vulnerability, if it depends on has the vulnerability, if it depends on something like certain configurations or something like certain configurations or something like certain configurations or some little module or component to some little module or component to some little module or component to actually be reachable, you may be able actually be reachable, you may be able actually be reachable, you may be able to go to term like how many people are to go to term like how many people are to go to term like how many people are actually using this app or this actually using this app or this actually using this app or this configuration. You're like, all right, configuration. You're like, all right, configuration. You're like, all right, 10% of people have the app, but like 10% of people have the app, but like 10% of people have the app, but like literally no one's using it. literally no one's using it. literally no one's using it. And um maybe it's not the most critical And um maybe it's not the most critical And um maybe it's not the most critical thing to again disrupt folks like today thing to again disrupt folks like today thing to again disrupt folks like today about and another little measure you about and another little measure you about and another little measure you might be able to do might be able to do might be able to do is the level of use of whatever the is the level of use of whatever the is the level of use of whatever the problem application is. So you may make problem application is. So you may make problem application is. So you may make an app I don't know maybe it does help an app I don't know maybe it does help an app I don't know maybe it does help data or something and you're like all data or something and you're like all data or something and you're like all right so we see the customer has it right so we see the customer has it right so we see the customer has it installed in like production. You can installed in like production. You can installed in like production. You can ask them if you wish to say, "Hey, is ask them if you wish to say, "Hey, is ask them if you wish to say, "Hey, is this freom?" Um, but another thing you this freom?" Um, but another thing you this freom?" Um, but another thing you could do is look and say, "Really could do is look and say, "Really could do is look and say, "Really doesn't look like they're populating it doesn't look like they're populating it doesn't look like they're populating it with, you know, just much volume if any with, you know, just much volume if any with, you know, just much volume if any of of data." Um, bearing in mind that of of data." Um, bearing in mind that of of data." Um, bearing in mind that Euro is not always the answer because Euro is not always the answer because Euro is not always the answer because your component or whatever may ship with your component or whatever may ship with your component or whatever may ship with out of the box demo data to out of the box demo data to out of the box demo data to uh just so people get to know what um, uh just so people get to know what um, uh just so people get to know what um, you know, populated application should you know, populated application should you know, populated application should look like. So, um don't freak yourself look like. So, um don't freak yourself look like. So, um don't freak yourself out that there is data in there if out that there is data in there if out that there is data in there if you're the one who provided you're the one who provided you're the one who provided it. And then, um a final slide on it. And then, um a final slide on it. And then, um a final slide on opportunities is the ability to uh opportunities is the ability to uh opportunities is the ability to uh really speed up things again if you're really speed up things again if you're really speed up things again if you're like, "All right, this does look like like, "All right, this does look like like, "All right, this does look like it's being splitted or a researcher is it's being splitted or a researcher is it's being splitted or a researcher is like, I'm extremely frustrated with you. like, I'm extremely frustrated with you. like, I'm extremely frustrated with you. I'm going to go write about it tomorrow I'm going to go write about it tomorrow I'm going to go write about it tomorrow when it doesn't look like you're going when it doesn't look like you're going when it doesn't look like you're going to be able to get yourself any more to be able to get yourself any more to be able to get yourself any more time." um you might be able to do things time." um you might be able to do things time." um you might be able to do things like like force changes onto customer like like force changes onto customer like like force changes onto customer instances or again like really urgently instances or again like really urgently instances or again like really urgently um body your customers and say hey you um body your customers and say hey you um body your customers and say hey you know please address this in the next you know please address this in the next you know please address this in the next you know 24 hours or something. Um awesome know 24 hours or something. Um awesome know 24 hours or something. Um awesome for security you know you can get rid of for security you know you can get rid of for security you know you can get rid of the issue really quickly but it's super the issue really quickly but it's super the issue really quickly but it's super disruptive and you probably can only do disruptive and you probably can only do disruptive and you probably can only do that so many times. that so many times. that so many times. So it's disruptive within within the So it's disruptive within within the So it's disruptive within within the vendor as well as for everyone your vendor as well as for everyone your vendor as well as for everyone your customers to drop what they're doing and customers to drop what they're doing and customers to drop what they're doing and go deal with your your latest things. So go deal with your your latest things. So go deal with your your latest things. So definitely think about that quite a bit. definitely think about that quite a bit. definitely think about that quite a bit. Um it also I've heard uh one school of Um it also I've heard uh one school of Um it also I've heard uh one school of thought I was that I thought was thought I was that I thought was thought I was that I thought was interesting and I never thought about it interesting and I never thought about it interesting and I never thought about it myself but they were like hey we might myself but they were like hey we might myself but they were like hey we might be negatively establishing precedent be negatively establishing precedent be negatively establishing precedent here. I was like what do you mean like here. I was like what do you mean like here. I was like what do you mean like the patches are good like what's what's the patches are good like what's what's the patches are good like what's what's going on? Um, and they're like, "All going on? Um, and they're like, "All going on? Um, and they're like, "All right, remember shared responsibility right, remember shared responsibility right, remember shared responsibility model." And I was like, "All right." And model." And I was like, "All right." And model." And I was like, "All right." And the argument is that if you as a vendor the argument is that if you as a vendor the argument is that if you as a vendor go above and beyond in those critical go above and beyond in those critical go above and beyond in those critical cases and go and force changes um onto cases and go and force changes um onto cases and go and force changes um onto customer instances, again, looking out customer instances, again, looking out customer instances, again, looking out for for best for them, the customer for for best for them, the customer for for best for them, the customer could as a takeaway sit back and be could as a takeaway sit back and be could as a takeaway sit back and be like, "All right, well, in those times like, "All right, well, in those times like, "All right, well, in those times where it really really matters, the where it really really matters, the where it really really matters, the vendor is going to look out for my best vendor is going to look out for my best vendor is going to look out for my best interest and patch for me." interest and patch for me." interest and patch for me." So like I was like, "Oh, that's that's So like I was like, "Oh, that's that's So like I was like, "Oh, that's that's bad outcome." Um, so that's just another bad outcome." Um, so that's just another bad outcome." Um, so that's just another thing to think about. If you're going thing to think about. If you're going thing to think about. If you're going above and beyond every single time, that above and beyond every single time, that above and beyond every single time, that could be a precedent for that that could be a precedent for that that could be a precedent for that that customer to to customer to to customer to to um and again breaking something. I I um and again breaking something. I I um and again breaking something. I I think in security, I often forget that think in security, I often forget that think in security, I often forget that like availability is like one of the like availability is like one of the like availability is like one of the tenants. Um, and if you have a tenants. Um, and if you have a tenants. Um, and if you have a vulnerability that affects vulnerability that affects vulnerability that affects confidentiality or integrity and you go confidentiality or integrity and you go confidentiality or integrity and you go break something and take it offline, break something and take it offline, break something and take it offline, like you just kind of switch over to an like you just kind of switch over to an like you just kind of switch over to an availability impact and like got rid of availability impact and like got rid of availability impact and like got rid of any concern about I or C. Um, and then any concern about I or C. Um, and then any concern about I or C. Um, and then hopefully your anything you might break hopefully your anything you might break hopefully your anything you might break or something doesn't last too long, but or something doesn't last too long, but or something doesn't last too long, but potentially could count against time potentially could count against time potentially could count against time guarantees you have with the customer. guarantees you have with the customer. guarantees you have with the customer. And then you get into you have to give And then you get into you have to give And then you get into you have to give them credits. um you know what do you them credits. um you know what do you them credits. um you know what do you owe someone for breaking them even if owe someone for breaking them even if owe someone for breaking them even if you were trying to to fix an issue. So, you were trying to to fix an issue. So, you were trying to to fix an issue. So, one bonus opportunity I didn't put on one bonus opportunity I didn't put on one bonus opportunity I didn't put on there is in terts um you get an there is in terts um you get an there is in terts um you get an interesting perspective because you get interesting perspective because you get interesting perspective because you get to see all the areas of improvement that to see all the areas of improvement that to see all the areas of improvement that happened along the way before an issue happened along the way before an issue happened along the way before an issue ended up on you know with your team and ended up on you know with your team and ended up on you know with your team and not that we're perfect but you just get not that we're perfect but you just get not that we're perfect but you just get that perspective of seeing like all the that perspective of seeing like all the that perspective of seeing like all the stuff from the origination of the issue stuff from the origination of the issue stuff from the origination of the issue plus like operational problems plus like operational problems plus like operational problems um any sort of problems tech people or um any sort of problems tech people or um any sort of problems tech people or not people in process this uh that not people in process this uh that not people in process this uh that created this this reason that something created this this reason that something created this this reason that something is up on your desk, so to is up on your desk, so to is up on your desk, so to speak. So again, thank you very much. We speak. So again, thank you very much. We speak. So again, thank you very much. We wrote through that pretty quick. I know wrote through that pretty quick. I know wrote through that pretty quick. I know they gave me I don't know two 30 minute they gave me I don't know two 30 minute they gave me I don't know two 30 minute flops. Didn't know if I'd use both, but flops. Didn't know if I'd use both, but flops. Didn't know if I'd use both, but um what we talked about today was uh my um what we talked about today was uh my um what we talked about today was uh my argument that Esert SS has challenges argument that Esert SS has challenges argument that Esert SS has challenges and opportunities that are different and opportunities that are different and opportunities that are different than those at a strictly on vendor.

You can sache your way over to the corner and ask your over to the corner and ask your over to the corner and ask your question. We have plenty of time. Oh, and the reason for the mic is remote Oh, and the reason for the mic is remote Oh, and the reason for the mic is remote folks need another question. Hey, at my prior company um I won't Hey, at my prior company um I won't Hey, at my prior company um I won't mention the mention the mention the name they got in security treated the name they got in security treated the name they got in security treated the service because we had discovered that service because we had discovered that service because we had discovered that internal entities had started setting up internal entities had started setting up internal entities had started setting up services without going through uh the services without going through uh the services without going through uh the proper approval processes etc. So that proper approval processes etc. So that proper approval processes etc. So that left us scrambling but I can truthfully left us scrambling but I can truthfully left us scrambling but I can truthfully say we encountered a number of the say we encountered a number of the say we encountered a number of the issues that you're talking about issues that you're talking about issues that you're talking about especially the speed um compared to especially the speed um compared to especially the speed um compared to regular product security instant regular product security instant regular product security instant response 10x 20x password we have to response 10x 20x password we have to response 10x 20x password we have to move so just want to commenerate with move so just want to commenerate with move so just want to commenerate with you. Oh it's all good. Yeah thank you you. Oh it's all good. Yeah thank you you. Oh it's all good. Yeah thank you not grilling me either. not grilling me either. not grilling me either. Um, yeah, it's tough. And sometimes Um, yeah, it's tough. And sometimes Um, yeah, it's tough. And sometimes another thing you think about is like, another thing you think about is like, another thing you think about is like, hey, we could do a half solution today hey, we could do a half solution today hey, we could do a half solution today and you're like, should we? And one and you're like, should we? And one and you're like, should we? And one school of thought is like, okay, we school of thought is like, okay, we school of thought is like, okay, we closed half the issue really quickly. closed half the issue really quickly. closed half the issue really quickly. That's awesome. Again, assuming you're That's awesome. Again, assuming you're That's awesome. Again, assuming you're announcing like activity, but the other announcing like activity, but the other announcing like activity, but the other is is is like customers might end up being really like customers might end up being really like customers might end up being really confused, but they're like, I thought confused, but they're like, I thought confused, but they're like, I thought you fixed this. And we're like, we half you fixed this. And we're like, we half you fixed this. And we're like, we half did on Tuesday and then we did the other did on Tuesday and then we did the other did on Tuesday and then we did the other half on Thursday. And they're like, what half on Thursday. And they're like, what half on Thursday. And they're like, what are you doing? are you doing? are you doing? like, you know, we've got all these like like, you know, we've got all these like like, you know, we've got all these like uh change requests that came in. We get uh change requests that came in. We get uh change requests that came in. We get all these maintenance notices. Um you all these maintenance notices. Um you all these maintenance notices. Um you know, when is when are things complete know, when is when are things complete know, when is when are things complete or we can consider this done? Um and you or we can consider this done?

Um and you end up in an awkward spot having to end up in an awkward spot having to end up in an awkward spot having to understand like or educate on like full understand like or educate on like full understand like or educate on like full remediation versus mitigation. Okay. Uh so we have two question one. So Okay. Uh so we have two question one. So Okay. Uh so we have two question one. So firstly like what are some of the firstly like what are some of the firstly like what are some of the additional roles your team plays for S additional roles your team plays for S additional roles your team plays for S service as well other than ship on prem service as well other than ship on prem service as well other than ship on prem products products products some other some other some other roles interesting roles interesting roles interesting so our team actually does um quite a bit so our team actually does um quite a bit so our team actually does um quite a bit now I wouldn't say it's just because now I wouldn't say it's just because now I wouldn't say it's just because we're like a mostly hosted company um we're like a mostly hosted company um we're like a mostly hosted company um and when I talk to other terts it's and when I talk to other terts it's and when I talk to other terts it's interesting to see like what all interesting to see like what all interesting to see like what all services we're involved in But um for services we're involved in But um for services we're involved in But um for some of my folks who know our software some of my folks who know our software some of my folks who know our software and have been around for years then I and have been around for years then I and have been around for years then I also ask them to do like derivative also ask them to do like derivative also ask them to do like derivative research say hey you know we found we're research say hey you know we found we're research say hey you know we found we're told about one told about one told about one issue does this exist anywhere else issue does this exist anywhere else issue does this exist anywhere else right so that's some of the stuff we end right so that's some of the stuff we end right so that's some of the stuff we end up with content review so we're happy to up with content review so we're happy to up with content review so we're happy to have disclosures we just want to make have disclosures we just want to make have disclosures we just want to make sure they're accurate so like we're sure they're accurate so like we're sure they're accurate so like we're often reading um upcoming disclosures to often reading um upcoming disclosures to often reading um upcoming disclosures to say hey is this technically accurate is say hey is this technically accurate is say hey is this technically accurate is it you know fair that sort of it you know fair that sort of it you know fair that sort of So yeah, cool. Uh then second question So yeah, cool. Uh then second question So yeah, cool. Uh then second question is any advice for the companies who are is any advice for the companies who are is any advice for the companies who are in the transformation phase from onre to in the transformation phase from onre to in the transformation phase from onre to SAS from perspective to build a build SAS from perspective to build a build SAS from perspective to build a build that capability. I know um the that capability. I know um the that capability. I know um the presentation right before this I think presentation right before this I think presentation right before this I think GitHub was talking about they split CERT GitHub was talking about they split CERT GitHub was talking about they split CERT and BERT. I don't know if you would want and BERT. I don't know if you would want and BERT. I don't know if you would want to start there and then later figure out to start there and then later figure out to start there and then later figure out how to split, but how to split, but how to split, but um it just comes with a lot more subject um it just comes with a lot more subject um it just comes with a lot more subject matter expertise you might not have matter expertise you might not have matter expertise you might not have right off the bat. Like you have like right off the bat. Like you have like right off the bat. Like you have like Java folks and you're making your app Java folks and you're making your app Java folks and you're making your app and then all of a sudden it's like all and then all of a sudden it's like all and then all of a sudden it's like all right, what about engine X? What about right, what about engine X? What about right, what about engine X? What about like some backend service that came from like some backend service that came from like some backend service that came from some company you bought? You ever go some company you bought? You ever go some company you bought? You ever go that something else? that something else? that something else? So you're in for a learning curve, I So you're in for a learning curve, I So you're in for a learning curve, I guess. guess. guess. So, hey hey hey there. So, you had talked a few slides there. So, you had talked a few slides there. So, you had talked a few slides back about um sort of the pros and cons back about um sort of the pros and cons back about um sort of the pros and cons of disclosing your SAS vulnerabilities. of disclosing your SAS vulnerabilities. of disclosing your SAS vulnerabilities. Yeah. Dicey. before. Um, how do you before. Um, how do you before. Um, how do you view where to draw that line between the view where to draw that line between the view where to draw that line between the actual application code versus the actual application code versus the actual application code versus the supporting infrastructure as far as supporting infrastructure as far as supporting infrastructure as far as disclosures that that you think would be disclosures that that you think would be disclosures that that you think would be valuable for customers to still receive valuable for customers to still receive valuable for customers to still receive versus versus versus um giving them alert fatigue every time um giving them alert fatigue every time um giving them alert fatigue every time something? something? something? I've seen it. So I'm working on our CB I've seen it. So I'm working on our CB I've seen it. So I'm working on our CB policy now revising it. But I started policy now revising it. But I started policy now revising it. But I started looking at what other large tech looking at what other large tech looking at what other large tech companies do. I won't call them out, but companies do. I won't call them out, but companies do. I won't call them out, but some like I would say like really some like I would say like really some like I would say like really bleeding edge where they're like like bleeding edge where they're like like bleeding edge where they're like like critical and high security even if no critical and high security even if no critical and high security even if no customer action is required. They'll customer action is required. They'll customer action is required. They'll still tell you about it. I was like it's still tell you about it. I was like it's still tell you about it. I was like it's kind of cool if you have like the first kind of cool if you have like the first kind of cool if you have like the first power to do it. It's more exposure to power to do it. It's more exposure to power to do it. It's more exposure to write um and maybe customer questions. write um and maybe customer questions. write um and maybe customer questions. But I saw that like but I just buck it But I saw that like but I just buck it But I saw that like but I just buck it as like the leading edge as like the leading edge as like the leading edge folks. folks. folks. Um you could just draw a line at Um you could just draw a line at Um you could just draw a line at customer action whether it's like why customer action whether it's like why customer action whether it's like why bother something about it. Um and bother something about it. Um and bother something about it. Um and another little gotcha that I've seen is another little gotcha that I've seen is another little gotcha that I've seen is um having to dive into services that I um having to dive into services that I um having to dive into services that I thought were hosted only but we provide thought were hosted only but we provide thought were hosted only but we provide an onrem version as well. And I was an onrem version as well. And I was an onrem version as well. And I was like, "Oh, okay." So that one we like, "Oh, okay." So that one we like, "Oh, okay." So that one we sometimes give out to people. And then sometimes give out to people. And then sometimes give out to people. And then that is like to me just traditional, you that is like to me just traditional, you that is like to me just traditional, you know, on stuff. Um, so you're more know, on stuff. Um, so you're more know, on stuff. Um, so you're more looking at doing just the application looking at doing just the application looking at doing just the application code in case there's not deployment. code in case there's not deployment. code in case there's not deployment. Yeah. So if it's on prem to me, that's Yeah. So if it's on prem to me, that's Yeah. So if it's on prem to me, that's like way more straightforward. I was like way more straightforward. I was like way more straightforward. I was like, yeah. And seems like customers like, yeah. And seems like customers like, yeah. And seems like customers would have to take action to patch even would have to take action to patch even would have to take action to patch even at like what I thought was a hosted at like what I thought was a hosted at like what I thought was a hosted shared service. For sure. And then I do shared service. For sure. And then I do shared service. For sure. And then I do think it's neat just to watch like the think it's neat just to watch like the think it's neat just to watch like the trend of transparency toward those trend of transparency toward those trend of transparency toward those notable, you know, backend notable, you know, backend notable, you know, backend vulnerabilities as well. I was hoping to get I was hoping to get I was hoping to get more experiences more experiences more experiences with publicly known vulnerabilities, CVE with publicly known vulnerabilities, CVE with publicly known vulnerabilities, CVE reported by reported by reported by customers. They come to you task customers. They come to you task customers. They come to you task changing infrastructure or something changing infrastructure or something changing infrastructure or something like that and they say are are you like that and they say are are you like that and they say are are you vulnerable? Are you going to be fixing vulnerable? Are you going to be fixing vulnerable? Are you going to be fixing this? and using your research to find this? and using your research to find this? and using your research to find out, okay, we're not using that part of out, okay, we're not using that part of out, okay, we're not using that part of the code or we have this infrastructure the code or we have this infrastructure the code or we have this infrastructure control in place, it's not that high control in place, it's not that high control in place, it's not that high priority. We'll get to it during normal priority. We'll get to it during normal priority. We'll get to it during normal update cycle, right? We're not update cycle, right? We're not update cycle, right? We're not vulnerable to that in the way that this vulnerable to that in the way that this vulnerable to that in the way that this EV is describing even though it says EV is describing even though it says EV is describing even though it says it's a 10. Yeah. How will those it's a 10. Yeah. How will those it's a 10. Yeah. How will those conversations go? Thankfully, pretty conversations go? Thankfully, pretty conversations go? Thankfully, pretty smooth so far. Um so like Tomcat the smooth so far. Um so like Tomcat the smooth so far. Um so like Tomcat the other day really bad one but you had to other day really bad one but you had to other day really bad one but you had to like modify default value to make your like modify default value to make your like modify default value to make your file system read only and I was like file system read only and I was like file system read only and I was like there was like a bunch of reasons um in there was like a bunch of reasons um in there was like a bunch of reasons um in the end we were not not at all affected the end we were not not at all affected the end we were not not at all affected but so we had to dive into it and it I but so we had to dive into it and it I but so we had to dive into it and it I think it was pretty smooth and customers think it was pretty smooth and customers think it was pretty smooth and customers were like hey I read about this thing in were like hey I read about this thing in were like hey I read about this thing in the news the news the news um and we just want to know are you um and we just want to know are you um and we just want to know are you affected by this and so we do our deep affected by this and so we do our deep affected by this and so we do our deep dive to find out those preconditions and dive to find out those preconditions and dive to find out those preconditions and then we find out affected or But plus then we find out affected or But plus then we find out affected or But plus again, if you do have things, I don't again, if you do have things, I don't again, if you do have things, I don't know, other mitigations in place, it's know, other mitigations in place, it's know, other mitigations in place, it's almost a good opportunity to talk about almost a good opportunity to talk about almost a good opportunity to talk about them, be like, "Hey, no, no, we're not." them, be like, "Hey, no, no, we're not." them, be like, "Hey, no, no, we're not." Um, but it's it's interesting. I'm Um, but it's it's interesting. I'm Um, but it's it's interesting. I'm trying to get in the game of predicting trying to get in the game of predicting trying to get in the game of predicting which outside CDs are going to cause uh which outside CDs are going to cause uh which outside CDs are going to cause uh inquiries. So, we can maybe get to it inquiries. So, we can maybe get to it inquiries. So, we can maybe get to it like 12 to 24 hours sooner. Vulnerability, right? Yeah. Vulnerability, right? Yeah. Vulnerability, right? Yeah. And sometimes it's uh even nonproduct And sometimes it's uh even nonproduct And sometimes it's uh even nonproduct stuff. I think I've been asked about stuff. I think I've been asked about stuff. I think I've been asked about like the move it vulnerability and like the move it vulnerability and like the move it vulnerability and whatnot and I was like yeah sorry it's whatnot and I was like yeah sorry it's whatnot and I was like yeah sorry it's not product. So that was pretty not product. So that was pretty not product. So that was pretty quick. Thank you. quick. Thank you. quick. Thank you. Yeah. And if this particular topic Yeah. And if this particular topic Yeah. And if this particular topic specifically PERT software as a service specifically PERT software as a service specifically PERT software as a service cloud is of interest to you, the first cloud is of interest to you, the first cloud is of interest to you, the first PERT sig is in the beginning stages of PERT sig is in the beginning stages of PERT sig is in the beginning stages of revising the services framework and this revising the services framework and this revising the services framework and this is one of the work areas we identified is one of the work areas we identified is one of the work areas we identified about a year ago. We need to have some about a year ago. We need to have some about a year ago. We need to have some additional instructions or some new additional instructions or some new additional instructions or some new information. So, if this is something information. So, if this is something information. So, if this is something you're interested in participating in, you're interested in participating in, you're interested in participating in, we're going to be help shaping some of we're going to be help shaping some of we're going to be help shaping some of the uh framework around this. So, patch the uh framework around this. So, patch the uh framework around this. So, patch is welcome. Keep an eye out and join us is welcome. Keep an eye out and join us is welcome. Keep an eye out and join us to help update the framework for this to help update the framework for this to help update the framework for this important area that a lot of us are important area that a lot of us are important area that a lot of us are dealing with today. Calls are on dealing with today. Calls are on dealing with today. Calls are on Thursdays, right? Thursdays, right? Thursdays, right? That's awesome. I didn't know that. That's awesome. I didn't know that. That's awesome. I didn't know that. Yeah. Oh. Oh, believe me, I was gonna Yeah. Oh. Oh, believe me, I was gonna Yeah. Oh. Oh, believe me, I was gonna come bother you after this. So, does come bother you after this. So, does come bother you after this.
