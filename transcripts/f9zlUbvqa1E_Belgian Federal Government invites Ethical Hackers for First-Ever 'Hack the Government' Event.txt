I know Belgian ethical hacking market. I know Belgian ethical hacking market. I know this because I have seen him interacting this because I have seen him interacting this because I have seen him interacting with hackers at different events and with hackers at different events and with hackers at different events and they behave like as though they're they behave like as though they're they behave like as though they're meeting the pope for the first time. Uh meeting the pope for the first time. Uh meeting the pope for the first time. Uh he is a guest professor at one of our he is a guest professor at one of our he is a guest professor at one of our prestigious universities in Belgium and prestigious universities in Belgium and prestigious universities in Belgium and he is also an experienced bug bounty and he is also an experienced bug bounty and he is also an experienced bug bounty and ethical hacker. His day job is with our ethical hacker. His day job is with our ethical hacker. His day job is with our tech research group uh within CERT and tech research group uh within CERT and tech research group uh within CERT and uh he spent days and nights uh getting uh he spent days and nights uh getting uh he spent days and nights uh getting everything ready and uh scoping this everything ready and uh scoping this everything ready and uh scoping this project but luckily he's uh kept me in project but luckily he's uh kept me in project but luckily he's uh kept me in the loop the entire way. So uh there we the loop the entire way. So uh there we the loop the entire way. So uh there we go with that. go with that. go with that. Um so today the outline of this Um so today the outline of this Um so today the outline of this particular presentation is that we need particular presentation is that we need particular presentation is that we need to go back in time to understand. So we to go back in time to understand. So we to go back in time to understand. So we need to go back to the soup to need to go back to the soup to need to go back to the soup to understand what happened in the understand what happened in the understand what happened in the beginning. Uh I presume that there is beginning. Uh I presume that there is beginning. Uh I presume that there is going to be an opportunity to ask going to be an opportunity to ask going to be an opportunity to ask questions. Uh I don't mind taking questions. Uh I don't mind taking questions. Uh I don't mind taking questions during the session if that's questions during the session if that's questions during the session if that's appropriate or at the end. Um so I'm not appropriate or at the end. Um so I'm not appropriate or at the end. Um so I'm not sure there's a moderator to go through sure there's a moderator to go through sure there's a moderator to go through every question thoroughly, but there we every question thoroughly, but there we every question thoroughly, but there we go. We'll have a we'll give it a go. go. We'll have a we'll give it a go. go. We'll have a we'll give it a go. I've never done something from 3,000 km I've never done something from 3,000 km I've never done something from 3,000 km away. So here we are. So just to be away. So here we are. So just to be away. So here we are. So just to be clear because I know this can sometimes clear because I know this can sometimes clear because I know this can sometimes be tricky. exactly which government was be tricky. exactly which government was be tricky. exactly which government was being hacked. So you are based right being hacked. So you are based right being hacked. So you are based right here currently and I am going to here currently and I am going to here currently and I am going to actually bring you over to be with me in actually bring you over to be with me in actually bring you over to be with me in Belgium. Now you need to leave where you Belgium. Now you need to leave where you Belgium. Now you need to leave where you are and start to understand what Belgium are and start to understand what Belgium are and start to understand what Belgium is about to give you a little bit of is about to give you a little bit of is about to give you a little bit of insight as to how we were able to make insight as to how we were able to make insight as to how we were able to make uh hack the government happen.

And Belgium was the first European country to institutionalize and European country to institutionalize and European country to institutionalize and promote ethical promote ethical promote ethical hacking. And finally, Belgium holds the hacking. And finally, Belgium holds the hacking. And finally, Belgium holds the dubious Guinness World Record honor of dubious Guinness World Record honor of dubious Guinness World Record honor of having the most people to deliberately having the most people to deliberately having the most people to deliberately download a computer virus in an download a computer virus in an download a computer virus in an experiment by the Belgian IT expert Duda experiment by the Belgian IT expert Duda experiment by the Belgian IT expert Duda Stevens. He did it in 2007. Stevens. He did it in 2007. Stevens. He did it in 2007. Some 49 people willingly and Some 49 people willingly and Some 49 people willingly and deliberately downloaded a virus onto deliberately downloaded a virus onto deliberately downloaded a virus onto their computer. Stevens had been running their computer. Stevens had been running their computer. Stevens had been running a campaign for 6 months that offered a campaign for 6 months that offered a campaign for 6 months that offered users a free virus via the slogan, "Is users a free virus via the slogan, "Is users a free virus via the slogan, "Is your PC virus free? Get it infected your PC virus free? Get it infected your PC virus free? Get it infected here." And although we know better, I here." And although we know better, I here." And although we know better, I like to think this is probably this like to think this is probably this like to think this is probably this reason that the cyber center for cyber reason that the cyber center for cyber reason that the cyber center for cyber security Belgium exists to protect security Belgium exists to protect security Belgium exists to protect people like him or from him. Excuse me. people like him or from him. Excuse me. people like him or from him. Excuse me. I just didn't want to. Belgium is not an old country like to. Belgium is not an old country like to. Belgium is not an old country like our neighbors. We are less than 200 our neighbors. We are less than 200 our neighbors. We are less than 200 years old. And to put this into years old. And to put this into years old. And to put this into perspective, the US has about 250 years perspective, the US has about 250 years perspective, the US has about 250 years on us. We are a constitutional monarchy on us. We are a constitutional monarchy on us. We are a constitutional monarchy which means we have a prime minister and which means we have a prime minister and which means we have a prime minister and our very own king and our legal system our very own king and our legal system our very own king and our legal system is based on Napoleonic code and that is based on Napoleonic code and that is based on Napoleonic code and that might be significant for some of the might be significant for some of the might be significant for some of the lawyers who might be in the lawyers who might be in the lawyers who might be in the audience. audience. audience. So how we moved cyber outlaws to be So how we moved cyber outlaws to be So how we moved cyber outlaws to be cyber guardians? Well, that same year cyber guardians? Well, that same year cyber guardians? Well, that same year that that techie was being criminally that that techie was being criminally that that techie was being criminally charged, 2014, the Center for Cyber charged, 2014, the Center for Cyber charged, 2014, the Center for Cyber Security Belgium was created through the Security Belgium was created through the Security Belgium was created through the King's Royal Decree, reporting directly King's Royal Decree, reporting directly King's Royal Decree, reporting directly to the office of the Prime to the office of the Prime to the office of the Prime Minister. We need to step back in time Minister. We need to step back in time Minister. We need to step back in time to understand the context of hack the to understand the context of hack the to understand the context of hack the government. The foundations to meet our government. The foundations to meet our government. The foundations to meet our gold go live date on Wednesday the 13th gold go live date on Wednesday the 13th gold go live date on Wednesday the 13th of November 2024 at 9:00 had a lot that of November 2024 at 9:00 had a lot that of November 2024 at 9:00 had a lot that leaded up led up to that point. So just leaded up led up to that point. So just leaded up led up to that point. So just to recap before we move on, you know to recap before we move on, you know to recap before we move on, you know that Belgium is in the heart of Europe. that Belgium is in the heart of Europe. that Belgium is in the heart of Europe. You know how society and citizens you You know how society and citizens you You know how society and citizens you will learn about how society and our will learn about how society and our will learn about how society and our citizens go from vilifying hacker citizens go from vilifying hacker citizens go from vilifying hacker hackers to tolerating them and even hackers to tolerating them and even hackers to tolerating them and even encouraging them which is a really encouraging them which is a really encouraging them which is a really important step for accepting ethical important step for accepting ethical important step for accepting ethical hacking in your hacking in your hacking in your country. So we're going to climb the country. So we're going to climb the country. So we're going to climb the proverbial mountain and it's got to be proverbial mountain and it's got to be proverbial mountain and it's got to be proverbial because we don't have any proverbial because we don't have any proverbial because we don't have any here. First, what you need is someone here. First, what you need is someone here. First, what you need is someone who has the motivation to make a change. who has the motivation to make a change. who has the motivation to make a change. And in this case, Miguel Dereer, our And in this case, Miguel Dereer, our And in this case, Miguel Dereer, our general director of the CCB and several general director of the CCB and several general director of the CCB and several key members of his team, such as our key members of his team, such as our key members of his team, such as our lawyer and the head of the um ser cyber lawyer and the head of the um ser cyber lawyer and the head of the um ser cyber emergency response team were behind that emergency response team were behind that emergency response team were behind that 100%. We also had a pretty uh viciferous 100%. We also had a pretty uh viciferous 100%. We also had a pretty uh viciferous uh ethical hacking group. they were very uh ethical hacking group. they were very uh ethical hacking group. they were very um willing to go lobbying and and uh um willing to go lobbying and and uh um willing to go lobbying and and uh create uh sensations in the press but create uh sensations in the press but create uh sensations in the press but there were also many more people who there were also many more people who there were also many more people who were behind it as well. So to make such were behind it as well. So to make such were behind it as well. So to make such a societal societal shift you need a societal societal shift you need a societal societal shift you need people with the determination the drive people with the determination the drive people with the determination the drive and the belief that they can get that and the belief that they can get that and the belief that they can get that society to change to get people to take society to change to get people to take society to change to get people to take that first step up the mountain. The that first step up the mountain. The that first step up the mountain. The goal that uh Miguel had was to make goal that uh Miguel had was to make goal that uh Miguel had was to make Belgium one of the least vulnerable Belgium one of the least vulnerable Belgium one of the least vulnerable countries in Europe. countries in Europe. countries in Europe. and build a strong sec cyber security and build a strong sec cyber security and build a strong sec cyber security workforce. He wanted to develop future workforce. He wanted to develop future workforce. He wanted to develop future talent. He wanted to enhance crisis talent. He wanted to enhance crisis talent. He wanted to enhance crisis preparedness and he wanted to strengthen preparedness and he wanted to strengthen preparedness and he wanted to strengthen Belgium's cyber Belgium's cyber Belgium's cyber resilience. They were lofty resilience. They were lofty resilience. They were lofty goals. Before we actually managed to uh goals. Before we actually managed to uh goals. Before we actually managed to uh enable ethical hackers to operate in enable ethical hackers to operate in enable ethical hackers to operate in Belgium, bug bounty platforms were Belgium, bug bounty platforms were Belgium, bug bounty platforms were starting to take traction. um data starting to take traction. um data starting to take traction. um data protection became completely unavoidable protection became completely unavoidable protection became completely unavoidable within the EU because we had the within the EU because we had the within the EU because we had the implementation of the GDPR which is the implementation of the GDPR which is the implementation of the GDPR which is the EU's general data protection regulation EU's general data protection regulation EU's general data protection regulation which was passed in which was passed in which was passed in 2018. Several highprofile companies 2018. Several highprofile companies 2018. Several highprofile companies within Belgium had significant data within Belgium had significant data within Belgium had significant data breaches and so they started to turn to breaches and so they started to turn to breaches and so they started to turn to independent hackers for independent hackers for independent hackers for help. But what kind of procedure could help. But what kind of procedure could help. But what kind of procedure could you have for these hackers? it was still you have for these hackers? it was still you have for these hackers? it was still a criminal action to hack in Belgium. So a criminal action to hack in Belgium. So a criminal action to hack in Belgium. So they tried to do incentives like they tried to do incentives like they tried to do incentives like monetary rewards because they wanted to monetary rewards because they wanted to monetary rewards because they wanted to provide themselves with hackerpowered provide themselves with hackerpowered provide themselves with hackerpowered security. The US was much more mature at security. The US was much more mature at security. The US was much more mature at this point than Europe and especially this point than Europe and especially this point than Europe and especially than Belgium. Belgium is quite a than Belgium. Belgium is quite a than Belgium. Belgium is quite a conservative country in the most part conservative country in the most part conservative country in the most part but quirky. So we were still at the very but quirky. So we were still at the very but quirky. So we were still at the very early stages at that point. early stages at that point. early stages at that point. The first milestone for hack the The first milestone for hack the The first milestone for hack the government was we thought we need to government was we thought we need to government was we thought we need to legally protect those legally protect those legally protect those hackers. So we need to shift society to hackers. So we need to shift society to hackers. So we need to shift society to being able to accept ethical hackers and being able to accept ethical hackers and being able to accept ethical hackers and at the same time we also need to legally at the same time we also need to legally at the same time we also need to legally protect them. And it's not as easy as protect them. And it's not as easy as protect them. And it's not as easy as going hey just change the law especially going hey just change the law especially going hey just change the law especially with uh something like Napoleonic code. with uh something like Napoleonic code. with uh something like Napoleonic code. It's a web of complexity that needs to It's a web of complexity that needs to It's a web of complexity that needs to be very carefully considered due to be very carefully considered due to be very carefully considered due to ramifications that can pop up elsewhere. ramifications that can pop up elsewhere. ramifications that can pop up elsewhere. So if you pull a thread, it could very So if you pull a thread, it could very So if you pull a thread, it could very well um be quite horrible at the other well um be quite horrible at the other well um be quite horrible at the other end of it. So how do we even begin? end of it. So how do we even begin? end of it. So how do we even begin? Well, I interviewed our key contributor Well, I interviewed our key contributor Well, I interviewed our key contributor to creating the change and get him to to creating the change and get him to to creating the change and get him to explain how he got the start up the path explain how he got the start up the path explain how he got the start up the path of this hill. So I asked him the of this hill. So I asked him the of this hill. So I asked him the question, how did you find the correct question, how did you find the correct question, how did you find the correct connection point in the law where it connection point in the law where it connection point in the law where it could be adjusted for ethical hackers? could be adjusted for ethical hackers? could be adjusted for ethical hackers? This clip has subtitles, so it should This clip has subtitles, so it should This clip has subtitles, so it should help in case you don't fully get his uh help in case you don't fully get his uh help in case you don't fully get his uh accent. Here we go. Susan, just so you know, we're not Susan, just so you know, we're not Susan, just so you know, we're not getting the audio from the video. We are getting the audio from the video. We are getting the audio from the video. We are able to see the transcription, however. able to see the transcription, however. able to see the transcription, however. Oh, sorry about that. Oh, sorry about that. Oh, sorry about that. H Well, that was an error on my part. H Well, that was an error on my part. H Well, that was an error on my part. Sorry about that, guys. But I It's only Sorry about that, guys. But I It's only Sorry about that, guys. But I It's only this video and I have one other short this video and I have one other short this video and I have one other short one. Both of them have uh have uh one. Both of them have uh have uh one. Both of them have uh have uh subtitles. I do apologize. I'm glad I subtitles. I do apologize. I'm glad I subtitles. I do apologize. I'm glad I put subtitles on put subtitles on put subtitles on now. Okay. So, on 15th of February 2023, now. Okay. So, on 15th of February 2023, now. Okay. So, on 15th of February 2023, the new whistleblower law legalized the new whistleblower law legalized the new whistleblower law legalized ethical hacking even for cases where the ethical hacking even for cases where the ethical hacking even for cases where the hacked entity did not consent to it. hacked entity did not consent to it. hacked entity did not consent to it. This does not mean that the doors were This does not mean that the doors were This does not mean that the doors were thrown open for anyone to enter because thrown open for anyone to enter because thrown open for anyone to enter because that would be quite disingenuous. that would be quite disingenuous. that would be quite disingenuous. Ethical hackers had to be incredibly Ethical hackers had to be incredibly Ethical hackers had to be incredibly scrupulous about how they behaved to be scrupulous about how they behaved to be scrupulous about how they behaved to be able to be protected by us against being able to be protected by us against being able to be protected by us against being criminally criminally criminally charged. So how would they do it? They charged. So how would they do it? They charged. So how would they do it? They have four main conditions that they have have four main conditions that they have have four main conditions that they have to follow in the law as it was first to follow in the law as it was first to follow in the law as it was first passed. There was no there has to be passed. There was no there has to be passed. There was no there has to be proof that there was no intent to cause proof that there was no intent to cause proof that there was no intent to cause harm or obtain illegitimate benefits harm or obtain illegitimate benefits harm or obtain illegitimate benefits with their activities. And just keep in with their activities. And just keep in with their activities. And just keep in mind extortion is still illegal which mind extortion is still illegal which mind extortion is still illegal which could be tempting I suppose. The second could be tempting I suppose. The second could be tempting I suppose. The second was they had to report any uncovered was they had to report any uncovered was they had to report any uncovered cyber security vulnerable vulnerability cyber security vulnerable vulnerability cyber security vulnerable vulnerability as soon as possible to the CCB and to as soon as possible to the CCB and to as soon as possible to the CCB and to the organization that was being the organization that was being the organization that was being investigated. The third one was that investigated. The third one was that investigated. The third one was that they were not allowed to go any further they were not allowed to go any further they were not allowed to go any further than absolutely necessary and than absolutely necessary and than absolutely necessary and proportionate. proportionate. proportionate. This has been quite a sticking point This has been quite a sticking point This has been quite a sticking point within our law because it's a little bit within our law because it's a little bit within our law because it's a little bit tricky to determine when something is tricky to determine when something is tricky to determine when something is necessary and proportionate. But uh if necessary and proportionate. But uh if necessary and proportionate. But uh if they cause damage, there is civil civil they cause damage, there is civil civil they cause damage, there is civil civil action that can still be taken against action that can still be taken against action that can still be taken against them and we cannot protect them from them and we cannot protect them from them and we cannot protect them from civil action. There is not they are not civil action. There is not they are not civil action. There is not they are not allowed to have any information allowed to have any information allowed to have any information disclosure unless the CCB has given them disclosure unless the CCB has given them disclosure unless the CCB has given them authorization. This has also proved to authorization. This has also proved to authorization. This has also proved to be a rather tricky one over time. be a rather tricky one over time. be a rather tricky one over time. because some of the ethical hackers because some of the ethical hackers because some of the ethical hackers believe that those vulnerabilities believe that those vulnerabilities believe that those vulnerabilities should be fixed much more quickly than should be fixed much more quickly than should be fixed much more quickly than maybe the CCB would uh pressure them to maybe the CCB would uh pressure them to maybe the CCB would uh pressure them to do so. And if they were able to go to do so. And if they were able to go to do so. And if they were able to go to the press, they could potentially the press, they could potentially the press, they could potentially increase that pressure on that increase that pressure on that increase that pressure on that organization. However, it's only been organization. However, it's only been organization. However, it's only been one or two issues so far that we've one or two issues so far that we've one or two issues so far that we've encountered with that. The law, just so encountered with that. The law, just so encountered with that. The law, just so everybody knows, you can't just go out everybody knows, you can't just go out everybody knows, you can't just go out and start hacking. only applies in and start hacking. only applies in and start hacking. only applies in Belgium and it's really a case of when Belgium and it's really a case of when Belgium and it's really a case of when in Rome do as the Romans do. So when in Rome do as the Romans do. So when in Rome do as the Romans do. So when you're in Belgium, you're more proposals for amending this law is more proposals for amending this law is more proposals for amending this law is to also protect people from other to also protect people from other to also protect people from other European Union nation countries um when European Union nation countries um when European Union nation countries um when they're actually hacking a organization they're actually hacking a organization they're actually hacking a organization or a system that resides within Belgium. or a system that resides within Belgium. or a system that resides within Belgium. All the time the hacker must respect the All the time the hacker must respect the All the time the hacker must respect the GDPR and the data privacy laws. So, one milestone achieved. We managed So, one milestone achieved. We managed So, one milestone achieved. We managed to get that law passed and we managed to to get that law passed and we managed to to get that law passed and we managed to do it because the EU insisted that the do it because the EU insisted that the do it because the EU insisted that the whistleblower law had to be transposed whistleblower law had to be transposed whistleblower law had to be transposed into into into um law of the every nation. So, we were um law of the every nation. So, we were um law of the every nation. So, we were one of the first to do this. one of the first to do this. one of the first to do this. So, let's get to the next point. On the So, let's get to the next point. On the So, let's get to the next point. On the 15th of February 2023, as I said, the 15th of February 2023, as I said, the 15th of February 2023, as I said, the law was implemented. It gave legal law was implemented. It gave legal law was implemented. It gave legal protection. it had a procedure to follow protection. it had a procedure to follow protection. it had a procedure to follow if there was no CBD policy by the if there was no CBD policy by the if there was no CBD policy by the organization that was being organization that was being organization that was being investigated. But how do you have that investigated. But how do you have that investigated. But how do you have that protection in reality? How was it protection in reality? How was it protection in reality? How was it actually uh applied in our environment? actually uh applied in our environment? actually uh applied in our environment? Well, firstly, you had 24 hours when you Well, firstly, you had 24 hours when you Well, firstly, you had 24 hours when you found a possible vulnerability to give found a possible vulnerability to give found a possible vulnerability to give us a simplified notification. you had to us a simplified notification. you had to us a simplified notification. you had to notify the CCB and if the organization notify the CCB and if the organization notify the CCB and if the organization did not have a CVD policy, you also then did not have a CVD policy, you also then did not have a CVD policy, you also then had to or um notify the that had to or um notify the that had to or um notify the that organization just generally and not organization just generally and not organization just generally and not through the CVD through the CVD through the CVD process. Secondly, within 72 hours, a process. Secondly, within 72 hours, a process. Secondly, within 72 hours, a complete notification must follow the complete notification must follow the complete notification must follow the procedure which is detailed on our procedure which is detailed on our procedure which is detailed on our website. If you don't do a complete one, website. If you don't do a complete one, website. If you don't do a complete one, we are incapable of protecting them from we are incapable of protecting them from we are incapable of protecting them from criminal action against them. And these criminal action against them. And these criminal action against them. And these deadlines are important. Failure does deadlines are important. Failure does deadlines are important. Failure does mean that uh some ethical hackers have mean that uh some ethical hackers have mean that uh some ethical hackers have had charges placed against had charges placed against had charges placed against them. So how do we educate the very them. So how do we educate the very them. So how do we educate the very people we want to people we want to people we want to protect? The media coverage uh helped um protect? The media coverage uh helped um protect? The media coverage uh helped um but we also created fantastic t-shirt but we also created fantastic t-shirt but we also created fantastic t-shirt for critical vulnerabilities because for critical vulnerabilities because for critical vulnerabilities because we're the government. We're not allowed we're the government. We're not allowed we're the government. We're not allowed to give money. We also provided them to give money. We also provided them to give money. We also provided them with a personal letter signed by Miguel with a personal letter signed by Miguel with a personal letter signed by Miguel Deer Breaker, our director general of Deer Breaker, our director general of Deer Breaker, our director general of the CCB. And this is what our typical CCB. And this is what our typical CCB. And this is what our typical criminal used to look criminal used to look criminal used to look like. This is our criminal from the 2014 like. This is our criminal from the 2014 like. This is our criminal from the 2014 I was telling you the story about. His I was telling you the story about. His I was telling you the story about. His criminal record is listed on your right criminal record is listed on your right criminal record is listed on your right in that frame on on your right. And the in that frame on on your right. And the in that frame on on your right. And the congratulations letter from Miguel is on congratulations letter from Miguel is on congratulations letter from Miguel is on the left. His t-shirt reads in a the left. His t-shirt reads in a the left. His t-shirt reads in a programming code kind of way. And you programming code kind of way. And you programming code kind of way. And you might not be able to make it out so might not be able to make it out so might not be able to make it out so well, so I can read it out to you if you well, so I can read it out to you if you well, so I can read it out to you if you like. So that's while in Belgium, do like. So that's while in Belgium, do like. So that's while in Belgium, do have a beer. Hack ethically, find bugs have a beer. Hack ethically, find bugs have a beer. Hack ethically, find bugs gov assa report to CCB. Done. CCB gov assa report to CCB. Done. CCB gov assa report to CCB. Done. CCB realized that if we wanted to secure our realized that if we wanted to secure our realized that if we wanted to secure our society, hackers are essential. That society, hackers are essential. That society, hackers are essential. That meant that we needed to do things like meant that we needed to do things like meant that we needed to do things like acknowledge their talent, appreciate acknowledge their talent, appreciate acknowledge their talent, appreciate their effort, celebrate their findings, their effort, celebrate their findings, their effort, celebrate their findings, and help with creating the shift from and help with creating the shift from and help with creating the shift from villain to a valued member of society. villain to a valued member of society. villain to a valued member of society. And we really wanted to start And we really wanted to start And we really wanted to start concentrating on community building concentrating on community building concentrating on community building within the ethical hacking um arena. So the next point along our journey So the next point along our journey So the next point along our journey after we had almost operationalized it after we had almost operationalized it after we had almost operationalized it completely, it leads us to how to completely, it leads us to how to completely, it leads us to how to implement it and operationalize that implement it and operationalize that implement it and operationalize that actual reporting. So we get to the next actual reporting. So we get to the next actual reporting. So we get to the next spot. So we planned for the new law. We spot. So we planned for the new law. We spot. So we planned for the new law. We uh figured out how to create working and uh figured out how to create working and uh figured out how to create working and an effective system. But the uh an effective system. But the uh an effective system. But the uh responsibility to do that went to responsibility to do that went to responsibility to do that went to Jeanluke Peters, the head of the cyber Jeanluke Peters, the head of the cyber Jeanluke Peters, the head of the cyber emergency response team. It's my boss. emergency response team. It's my boss. emergency response team. It's my boss. Jeanluke never lost sight of Jeanluke never lost sight of Jeanluke never lost sight of implementing the necessary procedures of implementing the necessary procedures of implementing the necessary procedures of ensuring that legalities were abided by ensuring that legalities were abided by ensuring that legalities were abided by while juggling the capabilities for while juggling the capabilities for while juggling the capabilities for triaging, researching, and understanding triaging, researching, and understanding triaging, researching, and understanding the submitted reports. He has a really the submitted reports. He has a really the submitted reports. He has a really sharp eye on building an ecosystem. So, sharp eye on building an ecosystem. So, sharp eye on building an ecosystem. So, I asked John Luke about this, and here's I asked John Luke about this, and here's I asked John Luke about this, and here's what he had to say. And I apologize if what he had to say. And I apologize if what he had to say. And I apologize if I'm don't know how to get the speaker to I'm don't know how to get the speaker to I'm don't know how to get the speaker to work through my computer. So, there you work through my computer. So, there you work through my computer. So, there you go. CCB has a dedicated technical research CCB has a dedicated technical research CCB has a dedicated technical research team within John Luke's search team within John Luke's search team within John Luke's search department. They have exceptional department. They have exceptional department. They have exceptional talent. The range and the depth of talent. The range and the depth of talent. The range and the depth of knowledge that they have uh was core to knowledge that they have uh was core to knowledge that they have uh was core to being able to help build that community. being able to help build that community. being able to help build that community. They would be the ones who would triage They would be the ones who would triage They would be the ones who would triage all of the vulnerability reports all of the vulnerability reports all of the vulnerability reports submitted. They would have to leaz with submitted. They would have to leaz with submitted. They would have to leaz with the ethical hacker and the organization the ethical hacker and the organization the ethical hacker and the organization evolved and try and in some cases temper evolved and try and in some cases temper evolved and try and in some cases temper some uh backlash that would come from an some uh backlash that would come from an some uh backlash that would come from an organization that had been hacked which organization that had been hacked which organization that had been hacked which all of this built trust and credibility all of this built trust and credibility all of this built trust and credibility within the ethical hacking community. It within the ethical hacking community. It within the ethical hacking community. It doesn't hurt that Johan is also an doesn't hurt that Johan is also an doesn't hurt that Johan is also an ethical hacker. So uh he's uh our lead ethical hacker. So uh he's uh our lead ethical hacker. So uh he's uh our lead for the triage team. We had uh quite a for the triage team. We had uh quite a for the triage team. We had uh quite a few reports coming in. We had more and few reports coming in. We had more and few reports coming in. We had more and more t-shirt awards being sent. So CCB more t-shirt awards being sent. So CCB more t-shirt awards being sent. So CCB decided at that point they were going to decided at that point they were going to decided at that point they were going to sponsor a high-profile hacker conference sponsor a high-profile hacker conference sponsor a high-profile hacker conference called Brukcon to showcase the safe called Brukcon to showcase the safe called Brukcon to showcase the safe harbor law. Uh let me see for those who harbor law. Uh let me see for those who harbor law. Uh let me see for those who have never heard of BCON. I have a have never heard of BCON. I have a have never heard of BCON. I have a little thing about uh what they are little thing about uh what they are little thing about uh what they are because BrewCon is um quite a because BrewCon is um quite a because BrewCon is um quite a prestigious prestigious prestigious um eth hacking not ethical hacking just um eth hacking not ethical hacking just um eth hacking not ethical hacking just hacking event that has been held in hacking event that has been held in hacking event that has been held in Belgium for at least 15 years. Uh it Belgium for at least 15 years. Uh it Belgium for at least 15 years. Uh it started in Brussels which is why it's started in Brussels which is why it's started in Brussels which is why it's called Brukcon but it's only been held called Brukcon but it's only been held called Brukcon but it's only been held there once a year. It's quite the there once a year. It's quite the there once a year. It's quite the misnomer. It's held in a small village misnomer. It's held in a small village misnomer. It's held in a small village um not too far from us. So, let me see. um not too far from us. So, let me see. um not too far from us. So, let me see. Ah, here we go. It's an annual security Ah, here we go. It's an annual security Ah, here we go. It's an annual security and hacker conference for, and I quote, and hacker conference for, and I quote, and hacker conference for, and I quote, persons who delight in having an persons who delight in having an persons who delight in having an intimate understanding of the internal intimate understanding of the internal intimate understanding of the internal workings of a system, computers, and workings of a system, computers, and workings of a system, computers, and computer networks in particular. computer networks in particular. computer networks in particular. So we decided to do the sponsorship So we decided to do the sponsorship So we decided to do the sponsorship there and we decided to showcase what there and we decided to showcase what there and we decided to showcase what this this new law had uh created which this this new law had uh created which this this new law had uh created which is basically now nicknamed a safe harbor is basically now nicknamed a safe harbor is basically now nicknamed a safe harbor law. So at this point enter me as the law. So at this point enter me as the law. So at this point enter me as the project manager for this. I was asked to project manager for this. I was asked to project manager for this. I was asked to manage our presence at BRUCON. The uh manage our presence at BRUCON. The uh manage our presence at BRUCON. The uh request came around the first quarter of request came around the first quarter of request came around the first quarter of 2024. So about a year 2024. So about a year 2024. So about a year ago. Um, and that even at that time, ago. Um, and that even at that time, ago. Um, and that even at that time, just after I took over that role, there just after I took over that role, there just after I took over that role, there was talk of hosting a hack the was talk of hosting a hack the was talk of hosting a hack the government, but I kind of poo pooed it. government, but I kind of poo pooed it. government, but I kind of poo pooed it. I thought it was a crazy idea at the I thought it was a crazy idea at the I thought it was a crazy idea at the time. So, we're going to go to the time. So, we're going to go to the time. So, we're going to go to the penultimate step along our path upwards. I picked out the CCB upwards. I picked out the CCB upwards. I picked out the CCB sponsorship of BUCON as the penultimate sponsorship of BUCON as the penultimate sponsorship of BUCON as the penultimate stop on our climb because it is an easy stop on our climb because it is an easy stop on our climb because it is an easy focal point around which a lot of focal point around which a lot of focal point around which a lot of activity was occurring. for those who activity was occurring. for those who activity was occurring. for those who had never heard of it, you know, it was had never heard of it, you know, it was had never heard of it, you know, it was uh um quite illuminating for them when uh um quite illuminating for them when uh um quite illuminating for them when they arrived at the conference and they arrived at the conference and they arrived at the conference and discovered that Belgium actually had a discovered that Belgium actually had a discovered that Belgium actually had a safe uh harbor law for them. Um Bron safe uh harbor law for them. Um Bron safe uh harbor law for them. Um Bron attracts all sorts of hackers, including attracts all sorts of hackers, including attracts all sorts of hackers, including our own from our own organization. They our own from our own organization. They our own from our own organization. They warn you, you have to secure your own warn you, you have to secure your own warn you, you have to secure your own data. They give you a lovely badge that data. They give you a lovely badge that data. They give you a lovely badge that looks like this. and my team within well looks like this. and my team within well looks like this. and my team within well probably the first five or six minutes. probably the first five or six minutes. probably the first five or six minutes. Oh, my battery is dead on it. Oh, no. Oh, my battery is dead on it. Oh, no. Oh, my battery is dead on it. Oh, no. Here we go. Um, I will give you a little Here we go. Um, I will give you a little Here we go. Um, I will give you a little look as to how it look as to how it look as to how it went. They went and hacked the badge went. They went and hacked the badge went. They went and hacked the badge within minutes making it look like the within minutes making it look like the within minutes making it look like the Matrix. Don't know if you can see that Matrix. Don't know if you can see that Matrix. Don't know if you can see that very well. and it has CCP on it and very well. and it has CCP on it and very well. and it has CCP on it and every so often it glitches to say cert every so often it glitches to say cert every so often it glitches to say cert which is the group that uh we pretend to which is the group that uh we pretend to which is the group that uh we pretend to belong to. So nothing is safe in Bron. belong to. So nothing is safe in Bron. belong to. So nothing is safe in Bron. You do not want to connect to any Wi-Fi. You do not want to connect to any Wi-Fi. You do not want to connect to any Wi-Fi. You do not want to uh leave your device You do not want to uh leave your device You do not want to uh leave your device lying around. They in the past used to lying around. They in the past used to lying around. They in the past used to have a wall of shame so they would show have a wall of shame so they would show have a wall of shame so they would show where everybody was going. Um so it does where everybody was going. Um so it does where everybody was going. Um so it does attract uh quite a wide range of people. attract uh quite a wide range of people. attract uh quite a wide range of people. You could be sitting beside a black hat You could be sitting beside a black hat You could be sitting beside a black hat hacker on one side and a white hat hacker on one side and a white hat hacker on one side and a white hat hacker on the other. uh you just never hacker on the other. uh you just never hacker on the other. uh you just never know and this is where they come to find know and this is where they come to find know and this is where they come to find new and interesting techniques. It has new and interesting techniques. It has new and interesting techniques. It has become so famous that uh people from become so famous that uh people from become so famous that uh people from Japan also make a point to come and Japan also make a point to come and Japan also make a point to come and attend it. Getting tickets to it is like attend it. Getting tickets to it is like attend it. Getting tickets to it is like buying tickets to a Taylor Swift concert buying tickets to a Taylor Swift concert buying tickets to a Taylor Swift concert though because it sells out in seconds though because it sells out in seconds though because it sells out in seconds and they only have capacity for 600 and they only have capacity for 600 and they only have capacity for 600 people there. We did think that we might people there. We did think that we might people there. We did think that we might be able to do the hack the government be able to do the hack the government be able to do the hack the government uh hackathon actually at BrewCon. uh hackathon actually at BrewCon. uh hackathon actually at BrewCon. However, BRCON has a capture the flag However, BRCON has a capture the flag However, BRCON has a capture the flag competition that always operates there competition that always operates there competition that always operates there and we thought that we would actually be and we thought that we would actually be and we thought that we would actually be stepping on people's toes and we didn't stepping on people's toes and we didn't stepping on people's toes and we didn't really want to do that. So, it became really want to do that. So, it became really want to do that. So, it became clear that we needed to run it as an as clear that we needed to run it as an as clear that we needed to run it as an as a uh side event to BrookCon itself. So when we were there, we decided to So when we were there, we decided to So when we were there, we decided to have one clear and single message that have one clear and single message that have one clear and single message that wouldn't get diluted since it was one of wouldn't get diluted since it was one of wouldn't get diluted since it was one of the first times that CCB had been there the first times that CCB had been there the first times that CCB had been there as a sponsor in over a decade. Step one, as a sponsor in over a decade. Step one, as a sponsor in over a decade. Step one, find a bug. Step two, report a bug. We find a bug. Step two, report a bug. We find a bug. Step two, report a bug. We even created some swag for them, which even created some swag for them, which even created some swag for them, which uh you can possibly see here. We have a uh you can possibly see here. We have a uh you can possibly see here. We have a little mug and it tells them exactly how little mug and it tells them exactly how little mug and it tells them exactly how they should report their uh they should report their uh they should report their uh vulnerability and so on. Uh we provided vulnerability and so on. Uh we provided vulnerability and so on. Uh we provided coffee, free coffee, free tea and some coffee, free coffee, free tea and some coffee, free coffee, free tea and some smoothies to be able to fill up their smoothies to be able to fill up their smoothies to be able to fill up their mugs. And um we mugs. And um we mugs. And um we invited our guests or we invited some invited our guests or we invited some invited our guests or we invited some special guests of honor and our special guests of honor and our special guests of honor and our invitation to all of those who had been invitation to all of those who had been invitation to all of those who had been awarded t-shirt since the law had been awarded t-shirt since the law had been awarded t-shirt since the law had been um invoked in the first place. Um our um invoked in the first place. Um our um invoked in the first place. Um our stand it was quite fascinating to watch stand it was quite fascinating to watch stand it was quite fascinating to watch the people who attended this. Our stand the people who attended this. Our stand the people who attended this. Our stand became their safe place because we had became their safe place because we had became their safe place because we had invited these people. They would circle invited these people. They would circle invited these people. They would circle back around to us if they were starting back around to us if they were starting back around to us if they were starting to feel insecure. We also had Johan to feel insecure. We also had Johan to feel insecure. We also had Johan Callaway accepted as the CCB speaker. Callaway accepted as the CCB speaker. Callaway accepted as the CCB speaker. Sadly enough, like I said, he was not Sadly enough, like I said, he was not Sadly enough, like I said, he was not able to be here with us today. Um, and able to be here with us today. Um, and able to be here with us today. Um, and his skill and as as a hacker is is uh his skill and as as a hacker is is uh his skill and as as a hacker is is uh quite unparalleled because of uh the quite unparalleled because of uh the quite unparalleled because of uh the fact that he focuses on specifically API fact that he focuses on specifically API fact that he focuses on specifically API hacking. His knowledge and research hacking. His knowledge and research hacking. His knowledge and research skills are quite legendary. Um, so hack skills are quite legendary. Um, so hack skills are quite legendary. Um, so hack the government got announced at the end the government got announced at the end the government got announced at the end of his presentation. and he was one of of his presentation. and he was one of of his presentation. and he was one of the plenary speakers. The call to action the plenary speakers. The call to action the plenary speakers. The call to action was please come and sign up at our stand was please come and sign up at our stand was please come and sign up at our stand and we will give you more information and we will give you more information and we will give you more information about it. And before we actually about it. And before we actually about it. And before we actually attended the um conference, we had to attended the um conference, we had to attended the um conference, we had to figure out how do we ask these people to figure out how do we ask these people to figure out how do we ask these people to register their interest? I mean, they're register their interest? I mean, they're register their interest? I mean, they're hackers. Are Google forms appropriate? I hackers. Are Google forms appropriate? I hackers. Are Google forms appropriate? I mean, we have to be really careful mean, we have to be really careful mean, we have to be really careful because we can't allow personally because we can't allow personally because we can't allow personally identifiable information to leak. So, a identifiable information to leak. So, a identifiable information to leak. So, a colleague of mine suggested a method colleague of mine suggested a method colleague of mine suggested a method that would respect personally that would respect personally that would respect personally identifiable information from leaking identifiable information from leaking identifiable information from leaking and it would be airgapped, which is and it would be airgapped, which is and it would be airgapped, which is really quite fascinating. He suggested really quite fascinating. He suggested really quite fascinating. He suggested this a this a this a typewriter, which is actually really typewriter, which is actually really typewriter, which is actually really quite funny because uh a lot of people quite funny because uh a lot of people quite funny because uh a lot of people are quite young and have never seen a are quite young and have never seen a are quite young and have never seen a manual typewriter before in their lives. manual typewriter before in their lives. manual typewriter before in their lives. And I'm not sure if the uh screen can be And I'm not sure if the uh screen can be And I'm not sure if the uh screen can be read particularly well, but hackers read particularly well, but hackers read particularly well, but hackers can't resist trying. They actually did a can't resist trying. They actually did a can't resist trying. They actually did a failed SQL injection on our air gap failed SQL injection on our air gap failed SQL injection on our air gap system here. Uh we used a separate sheet system here. Uh we used a separate sheet system here. Uh we used a separate sheet of paper for every single person who of paper for every single person who of paper for every single person who registered their interest. We ensured registered their interest. We ensured registered their interest. We ensured that they gave us their first and last that they gave us their first and last that they gave us their first and last name in uppercase because sometimes last name in uppercase because sometimes last name in uppercase because sometimes last names can be tricky plus their email names can be tricky plus their email names can be tricky plus their email address. address. address. And that sign up was incredible and it And that sign up was incredible and it And that sign up was incredible and it showed us that we had at least interest showed us that we had at least interest showed us that we had at least interest from ethical hackers because we didn't from ethical hackers because we didn't from ethical hackers because we didn't have any money. We didn't have any prize have any money. We didn't have any prize have any money. We didn't have any prize hook. We only gave them the unique hook. We only gave them the unique hook. We only gave them the unique chance to hack high-profile federal chance to hack high-profile federal chance to hack high-profile federal government assets. It was the only thing government assets. It was the only thing government assets. It was the only thing that we could offer with this. And the that we could offer with this. And the that we could offer with this. And the government we'd never be able to give government we'd never be able to give government we'd never be able to give money. So our path to the pinnacle is money. So our path to the pinnacle is money. So our path to the pinnacle is not quite as straightforward as it shows not quite as straightforward as it shows not quite as straightforward as it shows on this slide. We have to have time to on this slide. We have to have time to on this slide. We have to have time to build our community. The community has build our community. The community has build our community. The community has to come first before you can start to to come first before you can start to to come first before you can start to offer anything such as a live uh hacking offer anything such as a live uh hacking offer anything such as a live uh hacking event. Uh Brukcon helped. We knew that event. Uh Brukcon helped. We knew that event. Uh Brukcon helped. We knew that the hackers were keen. We knew that they the hackers were keen. We knew that they the hackers were keen. We knew that they were looking for some kind of a were looking for some kind of a were looking for some kind of a community. And at the top, at the summit, at the And at the top, at the summit, at the And at the top, at the summit, at the peak, at the pinnacle, the foundations peak, at the pinnacle, the foundations peak, at the pinnacle, the foundations had finally been laid. Everything was in had finally been laid. Everything was in had finally been laid. Everything was in place to be able to begin with being place to be able to begin with being place to be able to begin with being able to offer something such as hacking able to offer something such as hacking able to offer something such as hacking a a a government. The societal shift had government. The societal shift had government. The societal shift had helped. The law had helped a lot. It got helped. The law had helped a lot. It got helped. The law had helped a lot. It got a lot of coverage in our country um in a lot of coverage in our country um in a lot of coverage in our country um in multiple languages. We had the process multiple languages. We had the process multiple languages. We had the process now in place that was needed for now in place that was needed for now in place that was needed for protection uh of ethical hackers protection uh of ethical hackers protection uh of ethical hackers legally. We were beginning to build our legally. We were beginning to build our legally. We were beginning to build our ecosystem of ethical hackers and we have ecosystem of ethical hackers and we have ecosystem of ethical hackers and we have arrived at the top. So now how do we arrived at the top. So now how do we arrived at the top. So now how do we actually hack the actually hack the actually hack the government because the top was not the government because the top was not the government because the top was not the end. Sorry the path to climb before end. Sorry the path to climb before end. Sorry the path to climb before organizing the event was what we have organizing the event was what we have organizing the event was what we have just gone through. So now we're coming just gone through. So now we're coming just gone through. So now we're coming to how did we actually do this? to how did we actually do this? to how did we actually do this? Uh uh we had a little bit of a straw Uh uh we had a little bit of a straw Uh uh we had a little bit of a straw poll within our organization and most of poll within our organization and most of poll within our organization and most of them agree that a live hacking event is them agree that a live hacking event is them agree that a live hacking event is the ultimate in security the ultimate in security the ultimate in security testing. So we've gone through the soup. testing. So we've gone through the soup. testing. So we've gone through the soup. We're now on to the main course. We're We're now on to the main course. We're We're now on to the main course. We're going to look at the meat and potatoes going to look at the meat and potatoes going to look at the meat and potatoes between the soup and the nuts of this between the soup and the nuts of this between the soup and the nuts of this meal. How did we convince three other meal. How did we convince three other meal. How did we convince three other federal organizations to participate? federal organizations to participate? federal organizations to participate? The stakeholders for hack the government The stakeholders for hack the government The stakeholders for hack the government included the CCB as the host and included the CCB as the host and included the CCB as the host and organizer, the ethical hacking community organizer, the ethical hacking community organizer, the ethical hacking community in Belgium and the targets. So CCB had been engaging I get targets. So CCB had been engaging I get targets. So CCB had been engaging I get to understand this part as well a bit. to understand this part as well a bit. to understand this part as well a bit. CCB isn't doing this in a vacuum. So we CCB isn't doing this in a vacuum. So we CCB isn't doing this in a vacuum. So we had been engaging the population over had been engaging the population over had been engaging the population over the past 10 years. We were supporting the past 10 years. We were supporting the past 10 years. We were supporting students via cyber security challenges. students via cyber security challenges. students via cyber security challenges. Uh we offer internships to uh cyber Uh we offer internships to uh cyber Uh we offer internships to uh cyber security students and some of our security students and some of our security students and some of our employees even teach as guest employees even teach as guest employees even teach as guest professors. Quite a few of them do. Um professors. Quite a few of them do. Um professors. Quite a few of them do. Um our team insert, manage and coach a our team insert, manage and coach a our team insert, manage and coach a student team called the red demons and student team called the red demons and student team called the red demons and enter them into an annual European cyber enter them into an annual European cyber enter them into an annual European cyber security competition. We have quite a security competition. We have quite a security competition. We have quite a few public contact points. We have few public contact points. We have few public contact points. We have something which we call safe on web. something which we call safe on web. something which we call safe on web. It's a system where you can report spam It's a system where you can report spam It's a system where you can report spam and fishing and this way we can build a and fishing and this way we can build a and fishing and this way we can build a map of what criminal activity is going map of what criminal activity is going map of what criminal activity is going on in the digital world within Belgium. on in the digital world within Belgium. on in the digital world within Belgium. Um we're one of the few countries that Um we're one of the few countries that Um we're one of the few countries that do this. We're starting to help other do this. We're starting to help other do this. We're starting to help other nations within the EU at any rate build nations within the EU at any rate build nations within the EU at any rate build the same kind of system. Plus we have the same kind of system. Plus we have the same kind of system. Plus we have education campaigns for all Belgians. education campaigns for all Belgians. education campaigns for all Belgians. Our most recent one has been um to make Our most recent one has been um to make Our most recent one has been um to make sure you turn on two-factor sure you turn on two-factor sure you turn on two-factor authentication. Um, we had some of our authentication. Um, we had some of our authentication. Um, we had some of our team get filmed driving into this team get filmed driving into this team get filmed driving into this village. It's the smallest village in village. It's the smallest village in village. It's the smallest village in Belgium. It has 71 residents. And what Belgium. It has 71 residents. And what Belgium. It has 71 residents. And what they did in a day was they went through they did in a day was they went through they did in a day was they went through and they um helped every single person and they um helped every single person and they um helped every single person who lived there to enable two-factor who lived there to enable two-factor who lived there to enable two-factor authentication on all their devices. So, authentication on all their devices. So, authentication on all their devices. So, they're now considered to be the safest they're now considered to be the safest they're now considered to be the safest uh cyber security place in Belgium. Uh, uh cyber security place in Belgium. Uh, uh cyber security place in Belgium. Uh, but hack the government definitely did but hack the government definitely did but hack the government definitely did not happen in a bubble. So what we did was we needed to try and So what we did was we needed to try and So what we did was we needed to try and encourage them to participate. encourage them to participate. encourage them to participate. Especially our poor guy with the Especially our poor guy with the Especially our poor guy with the criminal record. We have more than one criminal record. We have more than one criminal record. We have more than one with a criminal record. Don't resent us. with a criminal record. Don't resent us. with a criminal record. Don't resent us. Please come and help us. So we basically Please come and help us. So we basically Please come and help us. So we basically made a declaration of come and show us made a declaration of come and show us made a declaration of come and show us what you can do. We asked for their what you can do. We asked for their what you can do. We asked for their help, but we couldn't offer anything in help, but we couldn't offer anything in help, but we couldn't offer anything in return other than the fact that maybe return other than the fact that maybe return other than the fact that maybe they'd have a good time. they'd have a good time. they'd have a good time. Integrity, which is a company that Integrity, which is a company that Integrity, which is a company that offers bount bug bounty platforms within offers bount bug bounty platforms within offers bount bug bounty platforms within Belgium and uh worldwide, but they're Belgium and uh worldwide, but they're Belgium and uh worldwide, but they're actually a Belgian-based company, also actually a Belgian-based company, also actually a Belgian-based company, also helped us. So, what they did was they uh helped us. So, what they did was they uh helped us. So, what they did was they uh provided us with the platform so that we provided us with the platform so that we provided us with the platform so that we could run this event. Their input about could run this event. Their input about could run this event. Their input about how to do it was completely invaluable how to do it was completely invaluable how to do it was completely invaluable for us. Otherwise, we'd have had to for us. Otherwise, we'd have had to for us. Otherwise, we'd have had to learn the hard way and we probably never learn the hard way and we probably never learn the hard way and we probably never would have got off the launch pad. They would have got off the launch pad. They would have got off the launch pad. They taught us things like communication is taught us things like communication is taught us things like communication is essential, especially with all of your essential, especially with all of your essential, especially with all of your ethical hackers. They recommended using ethical hackers. They recommended using ethical hackers. They recommended using Discord, not optimal. Um, but that Discord, not optimal. Um, but that Discord, not optimal. Um, but that wisdom saved us a lot. Um, I do work wisdom saved us a lot. Um, I do work wisdom saved us a lot. Um, I do work with a team of quite young guys though, with a team of quite young guys though, with a team of quite young guys though, and setting up the Discord server landed and setting up the Discord server landed and setting up the Discord server landed on me because most of them, while they on me because most of them, while they on me because most of them, while they wear young suits, are actually boomers wear young suits, are actually boomers wear young suits, are actually boomers deep down inside and not very deep down inside and not very deep down inside and not very technologically proficient for that. technologically proficient for that. technologically proficient for that. Um, they also integrity taught us about Um, they also integrity taught us about Um, they also integrity taught us about the psychology of scope releases. It's the psychology of scope releases. It's the psychology of scope releases. It's like watching the all these TV shows like watching the all these TV shows like watching the all these TV shows where they, you know, you get to find where they, you know, you get to find where they, you know, you get to find out what the next thing is, but you got out what the next thing is, but you got out what the next thing is, but you got to wait until a few days later. Um, by to wait until a few days later. Um, by to wait until a few days later. Um, by being able to have scope released in being able to have scope released in being able to have scope released in intervals, it means that you have more intervals, it means that you have more intervals, it means that you have more eyes on the target. You have more eyes on the target. You have more eyes on the target. You have more contact points with your um hackers. contact points with your um hackers. contact points with your um hackers. You're able to keep the engagement You're able to keep the engagement You're able to keep the engagement because you're able to have a reason to because you're able to have a reason to because you're able to have a reason to be able to talk with them on a regular be able to talk with them on a regular be able to talk with them on a regular basis. Also, the psychology of finding basis. Also, the psychology of finding basis. Also, the psychology of finding leads and bugs in the first hours was leads and bugs in the first hours was leads and bugs in the first hours was critical. So, some of our guys even went critical. So, some of our guys even went critical. So, some of our guys even went out and had a look prior to the event out and had a look prior to the event out and had a look prior to the event going live in case they needed to give going live in case they needed to give going live in case they needed to give anybody a little bit of a boost. We were anybody a little bit of a boost. We were anybody a little bit of a boost. We were really scared would they find anything. The other thing that you need anything. The other thing that you need anything. The other thing that you need to be um careful about is um not having to be um careful about is um not having to be um careful about is um not having some kind of profile defined about what some kind of profile defined about what some kind of profile defined about what an ethical hacker looks like, behaves an ethical hacker looks like, behaves an ethical hacker looks like, behaves like or does. Not everybody has the same like or does. Not everybody has the same like or does. Not everybody has the same approach or sees the same things. So we approach or sees the same things. So we approach or sees the same things. So we didn't have any defined profile. We did didn't have any defined profile. We did didn't have any defined profile. We did have some rules as to how we wanted to have some rules as to how we wanted to have some rules as to how we wanted to attract people but that was not one of attract people but that was not one of attract people but that was not one of them. We had to end up rewriting a lot them. We had to end up rewriting a lot them. We had to end up rewriting a lot of stereotypes even internally. Some of of stereotypes even internally. Some of of stereotypes even internally. Some of our own people had quite a bit of our own people had quite a bit of our own people had quite a bit of stereotyping uh about what they thought stereotyping uh about what they thought stereotyping uh about what they thought an ethical hacker would respond to or an ethical hacker would respond to or an ethical hacker would respond to or how they would uh behave. But when we how they would uh behave. But when we how they would uh behave. But when we asked for the help they responded in in asked for the help they responded in in asked for the help they responded in in uh quite significant form. So for this uh quite significant form. So for this uh quite significant form. So for this part, never underestimate the knowledge part, never underestimate the knowledge part, never underestimate the knowledge and the motivation and the experience in and the motivation and the experience in and the motivation and the experience in your general population. You'd be really your general population. You'd be really your general population. You'd be really surprised where some of those gems can surprised where some of those gems can surprised where some of those gems can suddenly come out from. And for us, this suddenly come out from. And for us, this suddenly come out from. And for us, this is one of the single most important is one of the single most important is one of the single most important aspects to creating the magic that we aspects to creating the magic that we aspects to creating the magic that we ended up having with our event. Um, sadly enough, of course, you event. Um, sadly enough, of course, you event. Um, sadly enough, of course, you got to practice what you preach. You got to practice what you preach. You got to practice what you preach. You have to lead by example. So CCB had to have to lead by example. So CCB had to have to lead by example. So CCB had to put in our own assets into the scope and put in our own assets into the scope and put in our own assets into the scope and because our whole reason for being is because our whole reason for being is because our whole reason for being is cyber security we had to increase the cyber security we had to increase the cyber security we had to increase the rating of a validated vulnerability rating of a validated vulnerability rating of a validated vulnerability against us. So if you submitted a report against us. So if you submitted a report against us. So if you submitted a report that was assessed as low you got it that was assessed as low you got it that was assessed as low you got it bumped up to medium and medium got bumped up to medium and medium got bumped up to medium and medium got bumped up to high and you get the idea. bumped up to high and you get the idea. bumped up to high and you get the idea. Uh and this has impact on your Uh and this has impact on your Uh and this has impact on your leaderboard table. So um and integrity leaderboard table. So um and integrity leaderboard table. So um and integrity was giving people who were using the was giving people who were using the was giving people who were using the platform um reputation points. So this platform um reputation points. So this platform um reputation points. So this was an important one. However, uh some was an important one. However, uh some was an important one. However, uh some of our people in the organization found of our people in the organization found of our people in the organization found it a scary thing that we were laying it a scary thing that we were laying it a scary thing that we were laying ourselves bare which of course hackers ourselves bare which of course hackers ourselves bare which of course hackers can do to us any time because we have can do to us any time because we have can do to us any time because we have this uh law in place that uh you can this uh law in place that uh you can this uh law in place that uh you can hack anything. potentially we could have hack anything. potentially we could have hack anything. potentially we could have run this whole event without even asking run this whole event without even asking run this whole event without even asking the federal agencies if they wanted to the federal agencies if they wanted to the federal agencies if they wanted to give us some scopes, but we didn't. We give us some scopes, but we didn't. We give us some scopes, but we didn't. We decided that we were going to involve decided that we were going to involve decided that we were going to involve them in the process them in the process them in the process completely. However, this experience of completely. However, this experience of completely. However, this experience of opening ourselves up to being hacked opening ourselves up to being hacked opening ourselves up to being hacked gave us insight for how we could address gave us insight for how we could address gave us insight for how we could address potential objections that the other potential objections that the other potential objections that the other organizations have who are not quite as organizations have who are not quite as organizations have who are not quite as far along the process as the lead of far along the process as the lead of far along the process as the lead of cyber security in Belgium. So how do you cyber security in Belgium. So how do you cyber security in Belgium. So how do you foster this foster this foster this innovation? We needed diversity with innovation? We needed diversity with innovation? We needed diversity with different motivations. We had to allow different motivations. We had to allow different motivations. We had to allow freedom of opinions and suggestions and freedom of opinions and suggestions and freedom of opinions and suggestions and ideas. We did try and look for common ideas. We did try and look for common ideas. We did try and look for common factors and we had narrowed it down to factors and we had narrowed it down to factors and we had narrowed it down to what we thought were three reasons why what we thought were three reasons why what we thought were three reasons why an ethical hacker would be an ethical hacker would be an ethical hacker would be interested. We have the earners, of interested. We have the earners, of interested. We have the earners, of course, people who are transactional, course, people who are transactional, course, people who are transactional, who are trophy hunters. Uh but you know who are trophy hunters. Uh but you know who are trophy hunters. Uh but you know those earners, we figured even if they those earners, we figured even if they those earners, we figured even if they couldn't get money, they could have couldn't get money, they could have couldn't get money, they could have bragging rights because we were going to bragging rights because we were going to bragging rights because we were going to crown them the uh government ethical crown them the uh government ethical crown them the uh government ethical hacker of hacker of hacker of 2024. Um you have some professionals. We 2024. Um you have some professionals. We 2024. Um you have some professionals. We weren't sure if we would be able to get weren't sure if we would be able to get weren't sure if we would be able to get them because every poster that these them because every poster that these them because every poster that these guys end up with behind them is a guys end up with behind them is a guys end up with behind them is a significant amount of money normally and significant amount of money normally and significant amount of money normally and we weren't able to offer any cash at we weren't able to offer any cash at we weren't able to offer any cash at all. Uh you have people who maybe all. Uh you have people who maybe all. Uh you have people who maybe collect swag. So we produce swag. We collect swag. So we produce swag. We collect swag. So we produce swag. We have the learners. we uh decided that we have the learners. we uh decided that we have the learners. we uh decided that we were going to reserve um seats for were going to reserve um seats for were going to reserve um seats for students for advanced researchers uh for students for advanced researchers uh for students for advanced researchers uh for people who were looking to expand their people who were looking to expand their people who were looking to expand their skill sets and who were curious. And skill sets and who were curious. And skill sets and who were curious. And then the third group were idealistic. We then the third group were idealistic. We then the third group were idealistic. We wanted to appeal to their patriotism to wanted to appeal to their patriotism to wanted to appeal to their patriotism to their altruism that they were actually their altruism that they were actually their altruism that they were actually helping keep Belgium safe and their helping keep Belgium safe and their helping keep Belgium safe and their neighbors and their friends and their neighbors and their friends and their neighbors and their friends and their family. family. family. We did make the in the event invitation We did make the in the event invitation We did make the in the event invitation only, but it was only because of the only, but it was only because of the only, but it was only because of the fact that we decided that we would only fact that we decided that we would only fact that we decided that we would only allow for this first rendition of the allow for this first rendition of the allow for this first rendition of the event to be for Belgian citizens only event to be for Belgian citizens only event to be for Belgian citizens only and we needed to do an ID check. So, it and we needed to do an ID check. So, it and we needed to do an ID check. So, it had to be invitation only. But that had to be invitation only. But that had to be invitation only. But that seemed to have had a good impact for us seemed to have had a good impact for us seemed to have had a good impact for us in the fact that a lot of people had a in the fact that a lot of people had a in the fact that a lot of people had a real sense of honor for the fact that real sense of honor for the fact that real sense of honor for the fact that they had been invited to a prestigious they had been invited to a prestigious they had been invited to a prestigious closed event. Be sure you know your rules. Ours were Be sure you know your rules. Ours were Be sure you know your rules. Ours were 50 people maximum. We didn't think our 50 people maximum. We didn't think our 50 people maximum. We didn't think our triage team could handle more than that. triage team could handle more than that. triage team could handle more than that. And we did all the triaging. The bug And we did all the triaging. The bug And we did all the triaging. The bug bounty platform did not help us with bounty platform did not help us with bounty platform did not help us with that. We had to have Belgian citizens. that. We had to have Belgian citizens. that. We had to have Belgian citizens. We had to have a proper ID check. We We had to have a proper ID check. We We had to have a proper ID check. We wanted a mix of the professionals and wanted a mix of the professionals and wanted a mix of the professionals and students. As I said, we first started students. As I said, we first started students. As I said, we first started that we thought we would have 20 that we thought we would have 20 that we thought we would have 20 professionals and 30 students. And professionals and 30 students. And professionals and 30 students. And ironically, we ended up half half. We ironically, we ended up half half. We ironically, we ended up half half. We wanted to make it all about the hackers. wanted to make it all about the hackers. wanted to make it all about the hackers. And this is where I say set firm And this is where I say set firm And this is where I say set firm boundaries because I had so many boundaries because I had so many boundaries because I had so many management people coming to me saying, management people coming to me saying, management people coming to me saying, "Oh, you've got to make it about this "Oh, you've got to make it about this "Oh, you've got to make it about this target. Oh, you've got to make it about target. Oh, you've got to make it about target. Oh, you've got to make it about the uh head of this department and so the uh head of this department and so the uh head of this department and so on. You need to, you know, hug them in on. You need to, you know, hug them in on. You need to, you know, hug them in the mix." And we had to beat a lot of the mix." And we had to beat a lot of the mix." And we had to beat a lot of people off with a stick. Stick with your people off with a stick. Stick with your people off with a stick. Stick with your boundaries completely. This is easy to boundaries completely. This is easy to boundaries completely. This is easy to say. So, what I suggest you do to try say. So, what I suggest you do to try say. So, what I suggest you do to try and stay on point, and this is just some and stay on point, and this is just some and stay on point, and this is just some of my experience, is create a playbook, of my experience, is create a playbook, of my experience, is create a playbook, create an event script, and create a create an event script, and create a create an event script, and create a timeline. And you need to make it so you timeline. And you need to make it so you timeline. And you need to make it so you have an elevator pitch. My elevator have an elevator pitch. My elevator have an elevator pitch. My elevator pitch was this program is created to pitch was this program is created to pitch was this program is created to celebrate the Belgian safe harbor law celebrate the Belgian safe harbor law celebrate the Belgian safe harbor law for ethical hackers and researchers. So, for ethical hackers and researchers. So, for ethical hackers and researchers. So, this isn't about the targets. This is this isn't about the targets. This is this isn't about the targets. This is about the ethical hackers and about the ethical hackers and about the ethical hackers and researchers being able to use this law researchers being able to use this law researchers being able to use this law to be able to go out and hack. And if to be able to go out and hack. And if to be able to go out and hack. And if anyone offers you help, accept it. anyone offers you help, accept it. anyone offers you help, accept it. You're going to need it. It's a really You're going to need it. It's a really You're going to need it. It's a really big job. So, it took five months of job. So, it took five months of job. So, it took five months of discussions to get targets to agree to discussions to get targets to agree to discussions to get targets to agree to be a target. Agreement from the top is be a target. Agreement from the top is be a target. Agreement from the top is essential, and they're usually the essential, and they're usually the essential, and they're usually the hardest ones to shift when you want to hardest ones to shift when you want to hardest ones to shift when you want to do something like this, especially from do something like this, especially from do something like this, especially from a government, especially from a federal a government, especially from a federal a government, especially from a federal government like ours, which is quite government like ours, which is quite government like ours, which is quite slow to move. As you saw, we couldn't slow to move. As you saw, we couldn't slow to move. As you saw, we couldn't form one for 541 form one for 541 form one for 541 days. So, I didn't have one signed up days. So, I didn't have one signed up days. So, I didn't have one signed up until the end of until the end of until the end of September. Our targets did include four September. Our targets did include four September. Our targets did include four federal public services in the end federal public services in the end federal public services in the end because that first one and ourselves, because that first one and ourselves, because that first one and ourselves, nobody considered us as being important nobody considered us as being important nobody considered us as being important kingpin in this. We had one really kingpin in this. We had one really kingpin in this. We had one really important federal public service who important federal public service who important federal public service who signed up to signed up to signed up to it. And one of the reasons was because I it. And one of the reasons was because I it. And one of the reasons was because I took him out for dinner. took him out for dinner. took him out for dinner. these people were or these organizations these people were or these organizations these people were or these organizations are all um high-profile in the mass are all um high-profile in the mass are all um high-profile in the mass market. So we have one which is called market. So we have one which is called market. So we have one which is called BOSA. They're responsible for policy and BOSA. They're responsible for policy and BOSA. They're responsible for policy and support of the government and the support of the government and the support of the government and the population. We have the group that are population. We have the group that are population. We have the group that are responsible for all of the medicines and responsible for all of the medicines and responsible for all of the medicines and health products for both humans and for health products for both humans and for health products for both humans and for animals within Belgium. So they're animals within Belgium. So they're animals within Belgium. So they're responsible for pharmacies, for doctors responsible for pharmacies, for doctors responsible for pharmacies, for doctors receiving things, for drugs being receiving things, for drugs being receiving things, for drugs being approved and so on. And the third group approved and so on. And the third group approved and so on. And the third group we had was we had was we had was uh I'm not going to give you the uh I'm not going to give you the uh I'm not going to give you the initials because it won't mean anything initials because it won't mean anything initials because it won't mean anything to you, but they were responsible for to you, but they were responsible for to you, but they were responsible for the annual vacation entitlements for the annual vacation entitlements for the annual vacation entitlements for independent workers. They have a bit independent workers. They have a bit independent workers. They have a bit more to do with that, but that's the more to do with that, but that's the more to do with that, but that's the area that they got us to concentrate on. area that they got us to concentrate on. area that they got us to concentrate on. And of course us, we put our own assets And of course us, we put our own assets And of course us, we put our own assets on the line, especially safe on on the line, especially safe on on the line, especially safe on web.be. Convincing the application web.be. Convincing the application web.be. Convincing the application owners wasn't easy. Their main concern owners wasn't easy. Their main concern owners wasn't easy. Their main concern was reputation. They had four main was reputation. They had four main was reputation. They had four main concerns. The first main concern was concerns. The first main concern was concerns. The first main concern was reputation. What's going to happen when reputation. What's going to happen when reputation. What's going to happen when bugs are found? So we told them that the bugs are found? So we told them that the bugs are found? So we told them that the results are completely confidential. And results are completely confidential. And results are completely confidential. And our intention is for every uh our intention is for every uh our intention is for every uh vulnerability that was found, we would vulnerability that was found, we would vulnerability that was found, we would celebrate it. I mean uh they need to celebrate it. I mean uh they need to celebrate it. I mean uh they need to have courage and confidence in doing have courage and confidence in doing have courage and confidence in doing this. They need to show people we care this. They need to show people we care this. They need to show people we care about security. We're allowing these about security. We're allowing these about security. We're allowing these people to have a go at finding something people to have a go at finding something people to have a go at finding something before the real hackers can. before the real hackers can. before the real hackers can. Confidentiality. they were worried Confidentiality. they were worried Confidentiality. they were worried about. Uh we have lots of layers of about. Uh we have lots of layers of about. Uh we have lots of layers of legal frameworks. So don't underestimate legal frameworks. So don't underestimate legal frameworks. So don't underestimate this. This takes a long time to sort out this. This takes a long time to sort out this. This takes a long time to sort out as well. And we have a dedicated legal as well. And we have a dedicated legal as well. And we have a dedicated legal group who uh know this law inside and group who uh know this law inside and group who uh know this law inside and out. But on top of that, you need one out. But on top of that, you need one out. But on top of that, you need one with your bug bounty platform and you with your bug bounty platform and you with your bug bounty platform and you need one with the um um that the one need one with the um um that the one need one with the um um that the one that the ethical hackers will sign up to that the ethical hackers will sign up to that the ethical hackers will sign up to and ones that uh the the targets need as and ones that uh the the targets need as and ones that uh the the targets need as well. they needed to have for well. they needed to have for well. they needed to have for confidentiality that they we showed them confidentiality that they we showed them confidentiality that they we showed them that we would have this verified ID that we would have this verified ID that we would have this verified ID because they would be Belgian citizens because they would be Belgian citizens because they would be Belgian citizens only so they could rest assured and most only so they could rest assured and most only so they could rest assured and most of the people not all were known to um of the people not all were known to um of the people not all were known to um our triage group already because they our triage group already because they our triage group already because they dealt with them for other dealt with them for other dealt with them for other um vulnerabilities that they had um vulnerabilities that they had um vulnerabilities that they had reported. reported. reported. So reassure is uh better that these So reassure is uh better that these So reassure is uh better that these ethical hackers find the vulnerabilities ethical hackers find the vulnerabilities ethical hackers find the vulnerabilities before someone else does. So while they before someone else does. So while they before someone else does. So while they say oh you know you might find something say oh you know you might find something say oh you know you might find something yeah of course so can someone else to yeah of course so can someone else to yeah of course so can someone else to address the concerns about uh their address the concerns about uh their address the concerns about uh their third concern was extra work. So we said third concern was extra work. So we said third concern was extra work. So we said that there's no service level agreement that there's no service level agreement that there's no service level agreement on bug fixes. What you need to do is you on bug fixes. What you need to do is you on bug fixes. What you need to do is you need to actually roll it into your need to actually roll it into your need to actually roll it into your releases and if it's a critical releases and if it's a critical releases and if it's a critical infrastructure one you know there's infrastructure one you know there's infrastructure one you know there's certain um procedures that you need to certain um procedures that you need to certain um procedures that you need to follow and it will help you with how you follow and it will help you with how you follow and it will help you with how you do your backups and your restoring and do your backups and your restoring and do your backups and your restoring and your monitoring. So that extra work, your monitoring. So that extra work, your monitoring. So that extra work, it's better to do it while it's a calm it's better to do it while it's a calm it's better to do it while it's a calm time and it's not real. And their fourth time and it's not real. And their fourth time and it's not real. And their fourth concern was downtime. And we chose never concern was downtime. And we chose never concern was downtime. And we chose never to gloss over any of the horrible things to gloss over any of the horrible things to gloss over any of the horrible things that can happen with this. We gave them that can happen with this. We gave them that can happen with this. We gave them no empty promises. Yeah, the chance no empty promises. Yeah, the chance no empty promises. Yeah, the chance isn't nonzero. there's potentially a isn't nonzero. there's potentially a isn't nonzero. there's potentially a hacker could do something which could hacker could do something which could hacker could do something which could bring your systems down. But on the bring your systems down. But on the bring your systems down. But on the bright side, it's good practice and bright side, it's good practice and bright side, it's good practice and resilience. resilience. resilience. We had a really short feedback loop. So We had a really short feedback loop. So We had a really short feedback loop. So our triagers if when they saw something our triagers if when they saw something our triagers if when they saw something come in or they heard something was come in or they heard something was come in or they heard something was going on or they saw something on the going on or they saw something on the going on or they saw something on the Discord channel would be able to contact Discord channel would be able to contact Discord channel would be able to contact the um target organization immediately the um target organization immediately the um target organization immediately because they had capabilities that were because they had capabilities that were because they had capabilities that were inhouse which we would be able to um inhouse which we would be able to um inhouse which we would be able to um discuss with the issue. We would monitor discuss with the issue. We would monitor discuss with the issue. We would monitor all of the reports that came in and we all of the reports that came in and we all of the reports that came in and we realized that was really essential realized that was really essential realized that was really essential because the hacker doesn't always because the hacker doesn't always because the hacker doesn't always realize what the bigger significance for realize what the bigger significance for realize what the bigger significance for some things were. some things were. some things were. Um, and we explained to these targets Um, and we explained to these targets Um, and we explained to these targets that each finding is a vulnerability that each finding is a vulnerability that each finding is a vulnerability that can't be exploited anymore. that can't be exploited anymore. that can't be exploited anymore. Vulnerabilities are not created by Vulnerabilities are not created by Vulnerabilities are not created by hackers. They're discovered. They hackers. They're discovered. They hackers. They're discovered. They existed yesterday and they probably existed yesterday and they probably existed yesterday and they probably existed last week. Will they still exist existed last week. Will they still exist existed last week. Will they still exist tomorrow? That we can have some control tomorrow? That we can have some control tomorrow? That we can have some control over. You can stop a breach before it over. You can stop a breach before it over. You can stop a breach before it happens with their help. The targets happens with their help. The targets happens with their help. The targets don't always realize that this is the don't always realize that this is the don't always realize that this is the closest to a real incident that they closest to a real incident that they closest to a real incident that they could get without the harm. It's not a could get without the harm. It's not a could get without the harm. It's not a tabletop exercise. It's a real test of tabletop exercise. It's a real test of tabletop exercise. It's a real test of their procedures. And it was free and it their procedures. And it was free and it their procedures. And it was free and it was a high quality security assessment. was a high quality security assessment. was a high quality security assessment. One of the um descriptions one of my One of the um descriptions one of my One of the um descriptions one of my colleagues said is when you have a colleagues said is when you have a colleagues said is when you have a pentester, a pentester basically does a pentester, a pentester basically does a pentester, a pentester basically does a ring fence check, you know, goes around, ring fence check, you know, goes around, ring fence check, you know, goes around, tries a whole bunch of different things tries a whole bunch of different things tries a whole bunch of different things around the edges. But an ethical hacker around the edges. But an ethical hacker around the edges. But an ethical hacker will find a small thread that's a little will find a small thread that's a little will find a small thread that's a little loose and they might just start pulling loose and they might just start pulling loose and they might just start pulling on and they'll just concentrate on that. on and they'll just concentrate on that. on and they'll just concentrate on that. And getting that kind of penetration And getting that kind of penetration And getting that kind of penetration testing, you can't you can't buy it testing, you can't you can't buy it testing, you can't you can't buy it easily. Um not unless you have a bug easily. Um not unless you have a bug easily. Um not unless you have a bug bounty program. And of course, federal bounty program. And of course, federal bounty program. And of course, federal government doesn't have bug bounty government doesn't have bug bounty government doesn't have bug bounty programs, at least not programs, at least not programs, at least not yet. Now, the ethical hackers were the yet. Now, the ethical hackers were the yet. Now, the ethical hackers were the most important thing for us for this most important thing for us for this most important thing for us for this event of hack the government. You need event of hack the government. You need event of hack the government. You need to show that you understand them. So, to show that you understand them. So, to show that you understand them. So, I'd like you to have a take a look at I'd like you to have a take a look at I'd like you to have a take a look at that little round logo in the bottom that little round logo in the bottom that little round logo in the bottom corner of my slide. Looks like an well, corner of my slide. Looks like an well, corner of my slide. Looks like an well, it is an iron atom. And those of you who it is an iron atom. And those of you who it is an iron atom. And those of you who know Belgium at all, it is a symbol of know Belgium at all, it is a symbol of know Belgium at all, it is a symbol of our automium, but not copyrighted like our automium, but not copyrighted like our automium, but not copyrighted like because there's no stands in it. So, because there's no stands in it. So, because there's no stands in it. So, it's just an iron atom. And there are it's just an iron atom. And there are it's just an iron atom. And there are certain balls in that logo that are certain balls in that logo that are certain balls in that logo that are colored that is part of a hacker colored that is part of a hacker colored that is part of a hacker subculture message. It's an emblem that subculture message. It's an emblem that subculture message. It's an emblem that they use to represent themselves. It they use to represent themselves. It they use to represent themselves. It comes from Conway's game of life, which comes from Conway's game of life, which comes from Conway's game of life, which was developed in 1970. It's called a was developed in 1970. It's called a was developed in 1970. It's called a glider. It's one of the smallest glider. It's one of the smallest glider. It's one of the smallest spaceships that he um created with his spaceships that he um created with his spaceships that he um created with his mathematical uh for those of you who mathematical uh for those of you who mathematical uh for those of you who don't know and it became the subculture don't know and it became the subculture don't know and it became the subculture um emblem because it's emerged around um emblem because it's emerged around um emblem because it's emerged around the same time as Unix and the internet the same time as Unix and the internet the same time as Unix and the internet came out. So the next thing we also did came out. So the next thing we also did came out. So the next thing we also did was we supplied them with Club Mate. was we supplied them with Club Mate. was we supplied them with Club Mate. It's the oil of European hacking. It's a It's the oil of European hacking. It's a It's the oil of European hacking. It's a caffeine-rich drink based on mate from caffeine-rich drink based on mate from caffeine-rich drink based on mate from uh South America, but it's made into a uh South America, but it's made into a uh South America, but it's made into a fizzy drink in Germany somewhere.

And if you have that, it shows that you you have that, it shows that you you have that, it shows that you understand this group uh at least in understand this group uh at least in understand this group uh at least in Belgium and uh countries surrounding us. Belgium and uh countries surrounding us. Belgium and uh countries surrounding us. You needed to have posters for the brag You needed to have posters for the brag You needed to have posters for the brag wall. Um we also got our hackers to sign wall. Um we also got our hackers to sign wall. Um we also got our hackers to sign each of the post or each of the posters each of the post or each of the posters each of the post or each of the posters for as many uh targets as we had. Had to for as many uh targets as we had. Had to for as many uh targets as we had. Had to sign four posters. We framed them um and sign four posters. We framed them um and sign four posters. We framed them um and we uh gave those to the targets, but it we uh gave those to the targets, but it we uh gave those to the targets, but it also gave we also gave one to every also gave we also gave one to every also gave we also gave one to every single hacker who was there. Um it's a single hacker who was there. Um it's a single hacker who was there. Um it's a bit of their brag wall. They um have bit of their brag wall. They um have bit of their brag wall. They um have this one actually has quite a few Easter this one actually has quite a few Easter this one actually has quite a few Easter eggs in it. The one standing behind me, eggs in it.

It has uh find a all three languages. It has uh find a all three languages. It has uh find a bug reporter bug in it there as well. We bug reporter bug in it there as well. We bug reporter bug in it there as well. We also created and I will have a little also created and I will have a little also created and I will have a little bit of show and tell for you. We also bit of show and tell for you. We also bit of show and tell for you. We also created a um challenge coin and we had created a um challenge coin and we had created a um challenge coin and we had it was just a very very simple challenge it was just a very very simple challenge it was just a very very simple challenge coin. It was simple because I was told coin. It was simple because I was told coin. It was simple because I was told about it about four weeks before I about it about four weeks before I about it about four weeks before I needed to have it. So I didn't really needed to have it. So I didn't really needed to have it. So I didn't really have much time and we thought we were have much time and we thought we were have much time and we thought we were hysterical. We came up with a slogan at hysterical. We came up with a slogan at hysterical. We came up with a slogan at the bottom of it which is vini vidi the bottom of it which is vini vidi the bottom of it which is vini vidi reporter. For those of you who who have reporter. For those of you who who have reporter. For those of you who who have not studied Latin, it means I came, I not studied Latin, it means I came, I not studied Latin, it means I came, I saw, I reported. And on the back it says saw, I reported. And on the back it says saw, I reported. And on the back it says ethical contributor. And we decided to ethical contributor. And we decided to ethical contributor. And we decided to make one for everybody who attended just make one for everybody who attended just make one for everybody who attended just because of the fact that it would be a because of the fact that it would be a because of the fact that it would be a limited collector's edition. And we limited collector's edition. And we limited collector's edition. And we appreciated their help. Um, we didn't appreciated their help. Um, we didn't appreciated their help. Um, we didn't want to make it so that just a few want to make it so that just a few want to make it so that just a few within the group for this particular within the group for this particular within the group for this particular thing came along. We also uh created thing came along. We also uh created thing came along. We also uh created some t-shirts for Brew Con. We had our some t-shirts for Brew Con. We had our some t-shirts for Brew Con. We had our staff wear a t-shirt that said on the staff wear a t-shirt that said on the staff wear a t-shirt that said on the back of it our back of it our back of it our um our web addresses end withbe which is um our web addresses end withbe which is um our web addresses end withbe which is quite convenient for us. What it says quite convenient for us. What it says quite convenient for us. What it says isbe so be estate supported hacker and isbe so be estate supported hacker and isbe so be estate supported hacker and then it has all of the small print on then it has all of the small print on then it has all of the small print on the back end as well. So for hack the the back end as well. So for hack the the back end as well. So for hack the government we created a I am a stateup government we created a I am a stateup government we created a I am a stateup supported hacker t-shirt for them. We supported hacker t-shirt for them. We supported hacker t-shirt for them. We also made sure that the venue and the also made sure that the venue and the also made sure that the venue and the food showed that we understood the food showed that we understood the food showed that we understood the evolving needs of hackers, of ethical evolving needs of hackers, of ethical evolving needs of hackers, of ethical hackers. So gone were pizza and beer, hackers. So gone were pizza and beer, hackers. So gone were pizza and beer, which don't get me wrong, pizza and beer which don't get me wrong, pizza and beer which don't get me wrong, pizza and beer are great, but we had more options.

And uh we down and eat, but some may. And uh we made it so that they had grab-and-go made it so that they had grab-and-go made it so that they had grab-and-go options all day long while they were in options all day long while they were in options all day long while they were in the in the event in person. the in the event in person. the in the event in person. We had to find a suitable venue. This is We had to find a suitable venue. This is We had to find a suitable venue. This is not always not always not always easy. Uh we had to double check its easy.

Uh so if you've never been an organizer for something like this, an organizer for something like this, an organizer for something like this, what goes on behind the curtains? Well, what goes on behind the curtains? Well, what goes on behind the curtains? Well, it took months to coordinate. Johan it took months to coordinate. Johan it took months to coordinate. Johan spent days and nights setting up the spent days and nights setting up the spent days and nights setting up the scope, ensuring it was engaging and scope, ensuring it was engaging and scope, ensuring it was engaging and enticing. And as a hacker himself, he enticing. And as a hacker himself, he enticing. And as a hacker himself, he also did a little bit of testing to see also did a little bit of testing to see also did a little bit of testing to see if it would have any interest for if it would have any interest for if it would have any interest for people. So he would say things like a people. So he would say things like a people. So he would say things like a fully patched Drupal website is not fully patched Drupal website is not fully patched Drupal website is not going to be interesting for these going to be interesting for these going to be interesting for these people. It has to have connectivity and people. It has to have connectivity and people. It has to have connectivity and interaction and stuff of interaction and stuff of interaction and stuff of interest. He also then spent quite a few interest. He also then spent quite a few interest.

So he had to do that as head of that. So he had to do that as well. It was exhausting. We did not well. It was exhausting. We did not well. It was exhausting. We did not account for just how many reports we account for just how many reports we account for just how many reports we would get and uh how important it was to would get and uh how important it was to would get and uh how important it was to make sure we assessed what was going on make sure we assessed what was going on make sure we assessed what was going on on the Discord channel just in case we on the Discord channel just in case we on the Discord channel just in case we wanted to make sure it would never get wanted to make sure it would never get wanted to make sure it would never get nasty. Um we had some nasty. Um we had some nasty. Um we had some um showand tell sessions arranged. Uh we um showand tell sessions arranged. Uh we um showand tell sessions arranged. Uh we had all of the little things that showed had all of the little things that showed had all of the little things that showed their appreciation to their their appreciation to their their appreciation to their contribution.

What we do know though is just a small What we do know though is just a small What we do know though is just a small piece of advice that having a legal piece of advice that having a legal piece of advice that having a legal framework while difficult and time framework while difficult and time framework while difficult and time consuming to make it a reality is a key consuming to make it a reality is a key consuming to make it a reality is a key instrument for for facilitating ethical instrument for for facilitating ethical instrument for for facilitating ethical hacking. Um hacking. Um hacking. Um and we are now preparing for the second and we are now preparing for the second and we are now preparing for the second edition of hack the government. It's uh edition of hack the government. It's uh edition of hack the government. It's uh really shown the power of small really shown the power of small really shown the power of small beginnings.
