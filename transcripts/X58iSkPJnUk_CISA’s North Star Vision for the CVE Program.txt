Um really really excited uh to be here to moderate this excited uh to be here to moderate this excited uh to be here to moderate this panel. Um if you all were part of last panel. Um if you all were part of last panel. Um if you all were part of last year's CISA panel, we talked about what year's CISA panel, we talked about what year's CISA panel, we talked about what kind of the day in the life of America's kind of the day in the life of America's kind of the day in the life of America's uh cyber defense agency and uh cyber defense agency and uh cyber defense agency and vulnerability management team uh does. vulnerability management team uh does. vulnerability management team uh does. And um it was a pretty interesting And um it was a pretty interesting And um it was a pretty interesting panel. We did talk about some future panel. We did talk about some future panel. We did talk about some future things. Uh this year we have a lot to things. Uh this year we have a lot to things. Uh this year we have a lot to celebrate. We've got um the 25-y year celebrate. We've got um the 25-y year celebrate. We've got um the 25-y year milestone which I'm sure you all have milestone which I'm sure you all have milestone which I'm sure you all have been celebrating during the conference been celebrating during the conference been celebrating during the conference this week. Um and it just um you know this week. Um and it just um you know this week. Um and it just um you know it's an opportunity for us at SISA and it's an opportunity for us at SISA and it's an opportunity for us at SISA and um as our community members here on the um as our community members here on the um as our community members here on the panel MITER being represented uh our panel MITER being represented uh our panel MITER being represented uh our vendors with Ben representing there and vendors with Ben representing there and vendors with Ben representing there and and Bob as our secure by design kind of and Bob as our secure by design kind of and Bob as our secure by design kind of future vision thinker um to acknowledge future vision thinker um to acknowledge future vision thinker um to acknowledge and thank all of you for everything and thank all of you for everything and thank all of you for everything you've done to build up this program um you've done to build up this program um you've done to build up this program um and uh enable essentially the the global and uh enable essentially the the global and uh enable essentially the the global ecosystem to be able to um identify, ecosystem to be able to um identify, ecosystem to be able to um identify, detect, mitigate uh vulnerabilities and detect, mitigate uh vulnerabilities and detect, mitigate uh vulnerabilities and um and you know just thankful from my um and you know just thankful from my um and you know just thankful from my perspective of being uh you know a cyber perspective of being uh you know a cyber perspective of being uh you know a cyber defender previously in my career um you defender previously in my career um you defender previously in my career um you know vulnerabilities um you know it's know vulnerabilities um you know it's know vulnerabilities um you know it's it's really it's a foundational thing it's really it's a foundational thing it's really it's a foundational thing that we really have to understand um to that we really have to understand um to that we really have to understand um to be able to uh defend against our be able to uh defend against our be able to uh defend against our adversaries and so a huge thank you to adversaries and so a huge thank you to adversaries and so a huge thank you to to all of you and all your to all of you and all your to all of you and all your contributions. uh we're going to talk contributions. uh we're going to talk contributions. uh we're going to talk about um those contributions and where about um those contributions and where about um those contributions and where we're going in the future. Um but we do we're going in the future. Um but we do we're going in the future. Um but we do want to acknowledge the success we've want to acknowledge the success we've want to acknowledge the success we've made um even uh you know starting from made um even uh you know starting from made um even uh you know starting from the last year's vulcon and kind of where the last year's vulcon and kind of where the last year's vulcon and kind of where we started with um you know focusing we started with um you know focusing we started with um you know focusing more on completeness and data quality more on completeness and data quality more on completeness and data quality and that's largely going to be uh the and that's largely going to be uh the and that's largely going to be uh the heart of our conversation here today. Um heart of our conversation here today. Um heart of our conversation here today. Um but I really wanted to make sure that we but I really wanted to make sure that we but I really wanted to make sure that we did this um in the traditional SISA way did this um in the traditional SISA way did this um in the traditional SISA way uh where we um include partners uh uh where we um include partners uh uh where we um include partners uh include your feedback as part part of include your feedback as part part of include your feedback as part part of the community. Uh and that's really the the community. Uh and that's really the the community. Uh and that's really the big thing that we want to push um as the big thing that we want to push um as the big thing that we want to push um as the narrative and you know kind of when you narrative and you know kind of when you narrative and you know kind of when you walk away from here uh you feel that you walk away from here uh you feel that you walk away from here uh you feel that you have an ability to give us that feedback have an ability to give us that feedback have an ability to give us that feedback um because we really want to hear it. um because we really want to hear it. um because we really want to hear it. Okay. So we're going to go ahead uh and Okay. So we're going to go ahead uh and Okay. So we're going to go ahead uh and get started with the first question. Um, get started with the first question. Um, get started with the first question. Um, and we're going to go to the next slide. and we're going to go to the next slide. and we're going to go to the next slide. I'm going to kick it over to Alec who, I'm going to kick it over to Alec who, I'm going to kick it over to Alec who, you know, just kind of moving moving um you know, just kind of moving moving um you know, just kind of moving moving um from that uh 25-y year milestone um you from that uh 25-y year milestone um you from that uh 25-y year milestone um you know, celebration. Um can you talk about know, celebration. Um can you talk about know, celebration. Um can you talk about a little bit about what what are some of a little bit about what what are some of a little bit about what what are some of the challenges and opportunities in the the challenges and opportunities in the the challenges and opportunities in the CVE program uh right now? Sure. Thanks. CVE program uh right now? Sure. Thanks. CVE program uh right now? Sure. Thanks. Okay. The mic's a little loud. Um yeah, Okay. The mic's a little loud. Um yeah, Okay. The mic's a little loud. Um yeah, and maybe some of you saw this slide and maybe some of you saw this slide and maybe some of you saw this slide earlier uh in a talk that I gave, but earlier uh in a talk that I gave, but earlier uh in a talk that I gave, but it's also part of our 25th anniversary it's also part of our 25th anniversary it's also part of our 25th anniversary report that was published back in report that was published back in report that was published back in October last year about the CVE program. October last year about the CVE program. October last year about the CVE program. I actually saw in a couple talks I actually saw in a couple talks I actually saw in a couple talks actually I think it was quoted and there actually I think it was quoted and there actually I think it was quoted and there was bits sort of drawn from it. was bits sort of drawn from it. was bits sort of drawn from it. Um that's right. Um that's right. Um that's right. Uh firstly that is a big celebration to Uh firstly that is a big celebration to Uh firstly that is a big celebration to recognize. I mean the the CVE program is recognize. I mean the the CVE program is recognize. I mean the the CVE program is something that has been around be well something that has been around be well something that has been around be well being around for 25 years is really being around for 25 years is really being around for 25 years is really remarkable in the sense that I can't remarkable in the sense that I can't remarkable in the sense that I can't really think of another really think of another really think of another um sort of capability or program or or um sort of capability or program or or um sort of capability or program or or anything like that in cyber security anything like that in cyber security anything like that in cyber security that has had such a long and enduring that has had such a long and enduring that has had such a long and enduring impact. Um in recent years I think it impact. Um in recent years I think it impact. Um in recent years I think it could be acknowledged fairly that we could be acknowledged fairly that we could be acknowledged fairly that we have been in a rapid growth phase of have been in a rapid growth phase of have been in a rapid growth phase of adoption um and program coverage and adoption um and program coverage and adoption um and program coverage and that has been seen in the form of uh an that has been seen in the form of uh an that has been seen in the form of uh an increasing number of CNAs to the increasing number of CNAs to the increasing number of CNAs to the community. um that element of an community. um that element of an community. um that element of an increasing number of CNAs has also uh increasing number of CNAs has also uh increasing number of CNAs has also uh coincided with more visibility and more coincided with more visibility and more coincided with more visibility and more coverage of vulnerabilities in the coverage of vulnerabilities in the coverage of vulnerabilities in the ecosystem and a greater number of ecosystem and a greater number of ecosystem and a greater number of vulnerabilities that we are seeing and vulnerabilities that we are seeing and vulnerabilities that we are seeing and we'll talk a little bit more about that. we'll talk a little bit more about that. we'll talk a little bit more about that. So when we think about some of the So when we think about some of the So when we think about some of the challenges and what we've been working challenges and what we've been working challenges and what we've been working on since last year's on since last year's on since last year's conference from a simple perspective, conference from a simple perspective, conference from a simple perspective, it's sort of been a recognition of the it's sort of been a recognition of the it's sort of been a recognition of the growth of the CVE program will continue growth of the CVE program will continue growth of the CVE program will continue and federation will continue, but we're and federation will continue, but we're and federation will continue, but we're starting to think about things in a in a starting to think about things in a in a starting to think about things in a in a in a sense of a new sort of quality in a sense of a new sort of quality in a sense of a new sort of quality era. So going from sort of a growth era era. So going from sort of a growth era era. So going from sort of a growth era that will continue and that's not ending that will continue and that's not ending that will continue and that's not ending but thinking more but thinking more but thinking more uh having a more considered approach uh having a more considered approach uh having a more considered approach about improving quality throughout the about improving quality throughout the about improving quality throughout the program and that's actually been a topic program and that's actually been a topic program and that's actually been a topic that's been discussed by a lot of talks that's been discussed by a lot of talks that's been discussed by a lot of talks that I've really uh enjoyed. I I've seen that I've really uh enjoyed. I I've seen that I've really uh enjoyed. I I've seen a few not as many as I uh hope to see a few not as many as I uh hope to see a few not as many as I uh hope to see once they're available online as well once they're available online as well once they're available online as well because quality has different elements because quality has different elements because quality has different elements to it. there's quality of individual to it. there's quality of individual to it. there's quality of individual records and we had I I really enjoyed records and we had I I really enjoyed records and we had I I really enjoyed Andrew Pollock's talk about how there Andrew Pollock's talk about how there Andrew Pollock's talk about how there can be greater quality from a can be greater quality from a can be greater quality from a perspective of requirements and for some perspective of requirements and for some perspective of requirements and for some of the data elements within the record. of the data elements within the record. of the data elements within the record. There's also quality when we think about There's also quality when we think about There's also quality when we think about processes processes processes uh in the CVE program and CNA's um uh in the CVE program and CNA's um uh in the CVE program and CNA's um working and having better automation working and having better automation working and having better automation abilities right to to enable better abilities right to to enable better abilities right to to enable better quality throughout the program. So those quality throughout the program. So those quality throughout the program. So those are things that we've been thinking are things that we've been thinking are things that we've been thinking about. As we look forward as well, it's about. As we look forward as well, it's about. As we look forward as well, it's it's important to say that we're it's important to say that we're it's important to say that we're thinking about ways that we can bring thinking about ways that we can bring thinking about ways that we can bring other CNAs into the program that are other CNAs into the program that are other CNAs into the program that are maybe underrepresented in terms of the maybe underrepresented in terms of the maybe underrepresented in terms of the ecosystem. So you know, medical devices, ecosystem. So you know, medical devices, ecosystem. So you know, medical devices, automotive, a lot of these domains automotive, a lot of these domains automotive, a lot of these domains perhaps that are less represented in the perhaps that are less represented in the perhaps that are less represented in the CNA community. I would say it's also CNA community. I would say it's also CNA community. I would say it's also extremely important that we continue to extremely important that we continue to extremely important that we continue to try and drive better engagement and try and drive better engagement and try and drive better engagement and coverage uh and collaboration with the coverage uh and collaboration with the coverage uh and collaboration with the open- source community which is a very open- source community which is a very open- source community which is a very different sort of kind of uh uh beast different sort of kind of uh uh beast different sort of kind of uh uh beast alto together and we're making strides alto together and we're making strides alto together and we're making strides there. Um but there's definitely more to there. Um but there's definitely more to there. Um but there's definitely more to be done. So yeah, I think that's that's be done. So yeah, I think that's that's be done. So yeah, I think that's that's been the focus and and I will say that been the focus and and I will say that been the focus and and I will say that um it's been it's been very enjoyable um it's been it's been very enjoyable um it's been it's been very enjoyable for me to to hear some of the for me to to hear some of the for me to to hear some of the conversations as well as the other talks conversations as well as the other talks conversations as well as the other talks about quality because this has really about quality because this has really about quality because this has really been a theme I think if we we don't been a theme I think if we we don't been a theme I think if we we don't really have themes for von con yet but really have themes for von con yet but really have themes for von con yet but like if we did I feel like it would be like if we did I feel like it would be like if we did I feel like it would be something around that this year. So over something around that this year. So over something around that this year. So over thanks Alec. Um, hey Bob, did you want thanks Alec. Um, hey Bob, did you want thanks Alec. Um, hey Bob, did you want to chime in a little bit on, you know, to chime in a little bit on, you know, to chime in a little bit on, you know, uh, Alec brought up the point about, um, uh, Alec brought up the point about, um, uh, Alec brought up the point about, um, you know, kind of targeted, uh, you know, kind of targeted, uh, you know, kind of targeted, uh, collaborations and partnerships for collaborations and partnerships for collaborations and partnerships for growth of visibility of of parts of the growth of visibility of of parts of the growth of visibility of of parts of the ecosystem. In the secure by design ecosystem. In the secure by design ecosystem. In the secure by design effort, we've done a lot of targeted effort, we've done a lot of targeted effort, we've done a lot of targeted partnership engagements. And so I think partnership engagements. And so I think partnership engagements. And so I think um you know some of the things you've um you know some of the things you've um you know some of the things you've done personally to bring um you know done personally to bring um you know done personally to bring um you know those principles into play if you could those principles into play if you could those principles into play if you could share share a little bit about that I' share share a little bit about that I' share share a little bit about that I' there was been a lot of progress in there was been a lot of progress in there was been a lot of progress in completeness overall um from you know completeness overall um from you know completeness overall um from you know from your perspective. Yeah. And so I from your perspective. Yeah. And so I from your perspective. Yeah. And so I think uh maybe what would be helpful is think uh maybe what would be helpful is think uh maybe what would be helpful is is just uh run through some of uh some is just uh run through some of uh some is just uh run through some of uh some of the ways that I think about the um uh of the ways that I think about the um uh of the ways that I think about the um uh Whoops. Why is it going backwards? Whoops. Why is it going backwards? Whoops. Why is it going backwards? the way I think a little bit about the the way I think a little bit about the the way I think a little bit about the the conversations that we have here uh the conversations that we have here uh the conversations that we have here uh at Vongcon but also just kind of in the at Vongcon but also just kind of in the at Vongcon but also just kind of in the community in general. And so um Peter community in general. And so um Peter community in general. And so um Peter asked Eller asked on Monday morning to asked Eller asked on Monday morning to asked Eller asked on Monday morning to tell us a little bit about community. tell us a little bit about community. tell us a little bit about community. And uh turns out I don't think he'd seen And uh turns out I don't think he'd seen And uh turns out I don't think he'd seen my slides, but I actually been thinking my slides, but I actually been thinking my slides, but I actually been thinking about this and I don't know if I'm about this and I don't know if I'm about this and I don't know if I'm thinking about this right. So I invite thinking about this right. So I invite thinking about this right. So I invite lots of uh lots of conversation on this lots of uh lots of conversation on this lots of uh lots of conversation on this but we of course at the center of all of but we of course at the center of all of but we of course at the center of all of this have the CBE database and of course this have the CBE database and of course this have the CBE database and of course we have the CNAs that populate it. And a we have the CNAs that populate it. And a we have the CNAs that populate it. And a lot of the conversations that I've had lot of the conversations that I've had lot of the conversations that I've had with folks kind of stop there and I with folks kind of stop there and I with folks kind of stop there and I think that's necessary but it may not be think that's necessary but it may not be think that's necessary but it may not be sufficient. And so, you know, I wanted sufficient. And so, you know, I wanted sufficient. And so, you know, I wanted to bring into our conversations within to bring into our conversations within to bring into our conversations within SISA and as we reach out to lots of SISA and as we reach out to lots of SISA and as we reach out to lots of other community members, we want to other community members, we want to other community members, we want to start talking more about things like the start talking more about things like the start talking more about things like the tools that people use, but I also said tools that people use, but I also said tools that people use, but I also said people. And so, I want to figure out who people. And so, I want to figure out who people. And so, I want to figure out who are the actual customers. And so, at the are the actual customers. And so, at the are the actual customers. And so, at the end of the day, there are a lot of folks end of the day, there are a lot of folks end of the day, there are a lot of folks uh and I used to be one of these folks uh and I used to be one of these folks uh and I used to be one of these folks who have to figure out how to deal with who have to figure out how to deal with who have to figure out how to deal with the realities of unsafe software. And so the realities of unsafe software. And so the realities of unsafe software. And so we have to figure out how to build we have to figure out how to build we have to figure out how to build teams, build processes. We have to teams, build processes. We have to teams, build processes. We have to figure out um how to to stack rank figure out um how to to stack rank figure out um how to to stack rank things because we it turns out you can't things because we it turns out you can't things because we it turns out you can't patch all the things. And so you have to patch all the things. And so you have to patch all the things. And so you have to actually have a methodology for doing actually have a methodology for doing actually have a methodology for doing so. And sometimes your methodology so. And sometimes your methodology so. And sometimes your methodology doesn't work quite right. So you have to doesn't work quite right. So you have to doesn't work quite right. So you have to adjust your methodology. Hopefully you adjust your methodology. Hopefully you adjust your methodology. Hopefully you didn't get popped too bad, but sometimes didn't get popped too bad, but sometimes didn't get popped too bad, but sometimes you do. So for me being more customer you do. So for me being more customer you do. So for me being more customer centric is really the is where my head centric is really the is where my head centric is really the is where my head is going these days. And so there's the is going these days. And so there's the is going these days. And so there's the first order customers where the tools first order customers where the tools first order customers where the tools that ingest the CVE records and try to that ingest the CVE records and try to that ingest the CVE records and try to provide some insights, but they're provide some insights, but they're provide some insights, but they're trying to provide insights to those trying to provide insights to those trying to provide insights to those downstream customers. So that upper downstream customers. So that upper downstream customers. So that upper right corner is really where I spend a right corner is really where I spend a right corner is really where I spend a lot of time thinking. And then of course lot of time thinking. And then of course lot of time thinking. And then of course uh we have the software publishers. They uh we have the software publishers. They uh we have the software publishers. They may be open source. They may be may be open source. They may be may be open source. They may be commercial. We've got other uh enrichers commercial. We've got other uh enrichers commercial. We've got other uh enrichers who contribute. We've got uh folks in who contribute. We've got uh folks in who contribute. We've got uh folks in the government who want to understand the government who want to understand the government who want to understand more about these kinds of things. We've more about these kinds of things. We've more about these kinds of things. We've got uh people like you. This is your got uh people like you. This is your got uh people like you. This is your little widget up here. So, it's these little widget up here. So, it's these little widget up here. So, it's these external parties. Yeah, absolutely. I external parties. Yeah, absolutely. I external parties. Yeah, absolutely. I have to make sure I include uh people have to make sure I include uh people have to make sure I include uh people who do data analytics and they provide who do data analytics and they provide who do data analytics and they provide insights and you've got a lot of this on insights and you've got a lot of this on insights and you've got a lot of this on your on your website and people like your on your website and people like your on your website and people like Jacobs also produce a lot of information Jacobs also produce a lot of information Jacobs also produce a lot of information that's I think very helpful for shaping that's I think very helpful for shaping that's I think very helpful for shaping our our work. And of course the our our work. And of course the our our work. And of course the bugfinders and and really um the the CVE bugfinders and and really um the the CVE bugfinders and and really um the the CVE program the CV database is really program the CV database is really program the CV database is really critical because again as one of the critical because again as one of the critical because again as one of the co-leads of our secure by design co-leads of our secure by design co-leads of our secure by design initiative I spend a lot of time trying initiative I spend a lot of time trying initiative I spend a lot of time trying to figure out how are we going to reduce to figure out how are we going to reduce to figure out how are we going to reduce the risk and of of running software and the risk and of of running software and the risk and of of running software and part of that can be by being smarter part of that can be by being smarter part of that can be by being smarter about the tools that we use and smarter about the tools that we use and smarter about the tools that we use and smarter about the the processes that about the the processes that about the the processes that organizations set up but that's only organizations set up but that's only organizations set up but that's only going to get us so far and if that was going to get us so far and if that was going to get us so far and if that was going to solve the problem, it would going to solve the problem, it would going to solve the problem, it would have solved it in at least in part by have solved it in at least in part by have solved it in at least in part by now. But that's not the way that we see now. But that's not the way that we see now. But that's not the way that we see the trends going. And so the other dial the trends going. And so the other dial the trends going. And so the other dial that we have is the dial that allows us that we have is the dial that allows us that we have is the dial that allows us to start talking more about recurring to start talking more about recurring to start talking more about recurring classes of defect. So, uh, I'm going to classes of defect. So, uh, I'm going to classes of defect. So, uh, I'm going to I'm going to ask a question. See if I I'm going to ask a question. See if I I'm going to ask a question. See if I can get some people to raise their can get some people to raise their can get some people to raise their hands. All right. So, yes, we'll get an hands. All right. So, yes, we'll get an hands. All right. So, yes, we'll get an audience reaction. How many of you are audience reaction. How many of you are audience reaction. How many of you are familiar with this paper that MITER familiar with this paper that MITER familiar with this paper that MITER wrote in 2007 called unforgivable wrote in 2007 called unforgivable wrote in 2007 called unforgivable vulnerabilities? Oh, a bunch. Great, vulnerabilities? Oh, a bunch. Great, vulnerabilities? Oh, a bunch. Great, great, marvelous. If you haven't read great, marvelous. If you haven't read great, marvelous. If you haven't read it, I would encourage you to do so. So, it, I would encourage you to do so. So, it, I would encourage you to do so. So, in this paper, MITER lists a uh sort of in this paper, MITER lists a uh sort of in this paper, MITER lists a uh sort of a um method for determining what sort of a um method for determining what sort of a um method for determining what sort of um we're gonna have to do interpretive um we're gonna have to do interpretive um we're gonna have to do interpretive dance from this part on. Um so they have dance from this part on. Um so they have dance from this part on. Um so they have a list of of um uh of criteria that a list of of um uh of criteria that a list of of um uh of criteria that would label a product as um as un defect would label a product as um as un defect would label a product as um as un defect as as as unforgivable. And they then list the unforgivable. And they then list the unforgivable. And they then list the ones that in 2007 meet those criteria. ones that in 2007 meet those criteria. ones that in 2007 meet those criteria. And the things that they have on the And the things that they have on the And the things that they have on the list include anybody want to list include anybody want to list include anybody want to guess? SQL guess? SQL guess? SQL injection. What was it? Buffer overflow. injection. What was it? Buffer overflow. injection. What was it? Buffer overflow. Buffer overflow. hardcoded credentials. Buffer overflow. hardcoded credentials. Buffer overflow. hardcoded credentials. Oh, I got Well, you guys are paying Oh, I got Well, you guys are paying Oh, I got Well, you guys are paying attention here on the last day. I attention here on the last day. I attention here on the last day. I appreciate that. I appreciate you. Um, appreciate that. I appreciate you. Um, appreciate that. I appreciate you. Um, yeah, directory traversal, operating yeah, directory traversal, operating yeah, directory traversal, operating system, command ejection, and if you go system, command ejection, and if you go system, command ejection, and if you go back and take a look at the um the the back and take a look at the um the the back and take a look at the um the the list of the MITER uh most dangerous list of the MITER uh most dangerous list of the MITER uh most dangerous weaknesses, and you know, I'm going to weaknesses, and you know, I'm going to weaknesses, and you know, I'm going to lean over here, make sure I'm getting my lean over here, make sure I'm getting my lean over here, make sure I'm getting my facts right from the MITER folks, but um facts right from the MITER folks, but um facts right from the MITER folks, but um that list uh from 2024 includes most of that list uh from 2024 includes most of that list uh from 2024 includes most of the the items from the 20 or 2007 paper. the the items from the 20 or 2007 paper. the the items from the 20 or 2007 paper. And so while many companies have made And so while many companies have made And so while many companies have made great strides in improving the security great strides in improving the security great strides in improving the security of their products, as an overall of their products, as an overall of their products, as an overall industry, we have a lot of work to do. industry, we have a lot of work to do. industry, we have a lot of work to do. And so when I think about those folks in And so when I think about those folks in And so when I think about those folks in the upper right corner, I'm thinking not the upper right corner, I'm thinking not the upper right corner, I'm thinking not just about how we can empower them to just about how we can empower them to just about how we can empower them to make tactical decisions today, but how make tactical decisions today, but how make tactical decisions today, but how we can start to look way upstream and we can start to look way upstream and we can start to look way upstream and figure out how do we make products that figure out how do we make products that figure out how do we make products that are more secure by design. CV program is are more secure by design. CV program is are more secure by design. CV program is a critical piece of that. We can't a critical piece of that. We can't a critical piece of that. We can't improve what we don't measure. Looking improve what we don't measure. Looking improve what we don't measure. Looking at the data scientist, is that is that at the data scientist, is that is that at the data scientist, is that is that true? Is this something? Okay, fine. true? Is this something? Okay, fine. true? Is this something? Okay, fine. Fine. I'm I'm on good track here. So, we Fine. I'm I'm on good track here. So, we Fine. I'm I'm on good track here. So, we need to be able to measure that. And so, need to be able to measure that. And so, need to be able to measure that. And so, things like data quality, which we've things like data quality, which we've things like data quality, which we've hinted at uh already, uh completeness, hinted at uh already, uh completeness, hinted at uh already, uh completeness, that's going to be super super important that's going to be super super important that's going to be super super important to our mission. Hey, Bob. Just for the to our mission. Hey, Bob. Just for the to our mission. Hey, Bob. Just for the image up there. Unfortunately, uh it's image up there. Unfortunately, uh it's image up there. Unfortunately, uh it's lovely to see Sandy of course, but she lovely to see Sandy of course, but she lovely to see Sandy of course, but she is unfortunately our top right quadrant. is unfortunately our top right quadrant. is unfortunately our top right quadrant. And you visualize that if you will, And you visualize that if you will, And you visualize that if you will, a little building with I'm sorry. I'm a little building with I'm sorry. I'm a little building with I'm sorry. I'm I'm sorry I'm blocking your slide. I'm sorry I'm blocking your slide. I'm sorry I'm blocking your slide. You're absorbing all the CVE render. You're absorbing all the CVE render. You're absorbing all the CVE render. So imagine the upper has I think Bob's So imagine the upper has I think Bob's So imagine the upper has I think Bob's point though is is really the CVE is the point though is is really the CVE is the point though is is really the CVE is the heart of the strategy all the you know heart of the strategy all the you know heart of the strategy all the you know things that we are doing as a collective things that we are doing as a collective things that we are doing as a collective community which everyone in that room is community which everyone in that room is community which everyone in that room is part of um contributing to is helping us part of um contributing to is helping us part of um contributing to is helping us to really understand these trends that to really understand these trends that to really understand these trends that um really help us to try to get left of um really help us to try to get left of um really help us to try to get left of boom um where we're not just responding boom um where we're not just responding boom um where we're not just responding to and mitigating vulnerabilities that to and mitigating vulnerabilities that to and mitigating vulnerabilities that we're able to reduce that eventually in we're able to reduce that eventually in we're able to reduce that eventually in the future um and have the software um the future um and have the software um the future um and have the software um manufacturers or producers um really manufacturers or producers um really manufacturers or producers um really help upfront um and but it's the trends help upfront um and but it's the trends help upfront um and but it's the trends that and the root causes uh with the that and the root causes uh with the that and the root causes uh with the CWEs that we are going to be able to do CWEs that we are going to be able to do CWEs that we are going to be able to do more so now that we've made so much more more so now that we've made so much more more so now that we've made so much more progress and that is really a thank you progress and that is really a thank you progress and that is really a thank you to everyone in the community that's to everyone in the community that's to everyone in the community that's putting together uh that information and putting together uh that information and putting together uh that information and uh into the CVE database when they uh into the CVE database when they uh into the CVE database when they submit their CVEs. on initial submission submit their CVEs. on initial submission submit their CVEs. on initial submission or even work with us afterwards to get or even work with us afterwards to get or even work with us afterwards to get the enrichment correct. So, um, so the enrichment correct. So, um, so the enrichment correct. So, um, so that's it's really good progress. I that's it's really good progress. I that's it's really good progress. I can't wait to show you guys some of the can't wait to show you guys some of the can't wait to show you guys some of the data in the future in this in the slides data in the future in this in the slides data in the future in this in the slides here. here. here. Bob, do you have anything else? Sorry. I Bob, do you have anything else? Sorry. I Bob, do you have anything else? Sorry. I I think that's uh I think that's the I think that's uh I think that's the I think that's uh I think that's the main thing you guys have any other main thing you guys have any other main thing you guys have any other I would just add that you know when we I would just add that you know when we I would just add that you know when we talk about the top 25 again that's just talk about the top 25 again that's just talk about the top 25 again that's just one way of measuring things. Um and you one way of measuring things. Um and you one way of measuring things. Um and you know of course it's title most dangerous know of course it's title most dangerous know of course it's title most dangerous software weaknesses implies a certain software weaknesses implies a certain software weaknesses implies a certain kind of thing but I think the real kind of thing but I think the real kind of thing but I think the real through line just to dovetail off is to through line just to dovetail off is to through line just to dovetail off is to say uh while we see an increase in say uh while we see an increase in say uh while we see an increase in vulnerabilities given the nature of vulnerabilities given the nature of vulnerabilities given the nature of increasing software increasing increasing software increasing increasing software increasing complexity these kinds of things um what complexity these kinds of things um what complexity these kinds of things um what we'd really like to see as that occurs we'd really like to see as that occurs we'd really like to see as that occurs is maybe a decrease in the repetition of is maybe a decrease in the repetition of is maybe a decrease in the repetition of these kinds of things such that you know these kinds of things such that you know these kinds of things such that you know we don't overwhelm people with the same we don't overwhelm people with the same we don't overwhelm people with the same kind of problems over and over. Yeah. kind of problems over and over. Yeah. kind of problems over and over. Yeah. And and yeah, that that's exactly right. And and yeah, that that's exactly right. And and yeah, that that's exactly right. And if you take a look at uh the the And if you take a look at uh the the And if you take a look at uh the the rise of quality and safety in other rise of quality and safety in other rise of quality and safety in other industries outside of software, so it's industries outside of software, so it's industries outside of software, so it's automotive safety, aviation, medical automotive safety, aviation, medical automotive safety, aviation, medical devices, chemical, like you name it, devices, chemical, like you name it, devices, chemical, like you name it, there are certain patterns that that uh there are certain patterns that that uh there are certain patterns that that uh cut across all of those. And one of cut across all of those. And one of cut across all of those. And one of those is to identify recurring classes those is to identify recurring classes those is to identify recurring classes of defect and working together to either of defect and working together to either of defect and working together to either as a individual company or across the as a individual company or across the as a individual company or across the industry to find ways to uh not just industry to find ways to uh not just industry to find ways to uh not just reduce those but eliminate those. And reduce those but eliminate those. And reduce those but eliminate those. And those are the kinds of habits and those are the kinds of habits and those are the kinds of habits and instincts that have served other instincts that have served other instincts that have served other industries very well. And I want to know industries very well. And I want to know industries very well. And I want to know how we can find ways to incorporate how we can find ways to incorporate how we can find ways to incorporate those into this industry. And I think those into this industry. And I think those into this industry. And I think how we do that may be uh an exercise how we do that may be uh an exercise how we do that may be uh an exercise that is going to require community not that is going to require community not that is going to require community not just participation but innovation. Um just participation but innovation. Um just participation but innovation. Um but I think that's what we want to do is but I think that's what we want to do is but I think that's what we want to do is is find ways to eliminate entire classes is find ways to eliminate entire classes is find ways to eliminate entire classes of recurring defect. And last point I'll of recurring defect. And last point I'll of recurring defect. And last point I'll put on it. I want to acknowledge that put on it. I want to acknowledge that put on it. I want to acknowledge that those in this room probably know this uh those in this room probably know this uh those in this room probably know this uh and that they're not necessarily and that they're not necessarily and that they're not necessarily contributing to the development of uh contributing to the development of uh contributing to the development of uh software in the way that is introducing software in the way that is introducing software in the way that is introducing a lot of these things over and over. You a lot of these things over and over. You a lot of these things over and over. You guys are reacting. You guys are guys are reacting. You guys are guys are reacting. You guys are responding and having to deal with it responding and having to deal with it responding and having to deal with it too. So acknowledging that that we need too. So acknowledging that that we need too. So acknowledging that that we need to find ways collectively uh and I know to find ways collectively uh and I know to find ways collectively uh and I know we try to work with the developers and we try to work with the developers and we try to work with the developers and those that uh sort of guide the those that uh sort of guide the those that uh sort of guide the developers and and pay you know and sort developers and and pay you know and sort developers and and pay you know and sort of create the incentives around these of create the incentives around these of create the incentives around these kinds of things um such that they take kinds of things um such that they take kinds of things um such that they take that into consideration more so we don't that into consideration more so we don't that into consideration more so we don't have these repetitions over. Okay, I think we're off to the over. Okay, I think we're off to the over. Okay, I think we're off to the next topic. Uh I think we have Ben's next topic. Uh I think we have Ben's next topic. Uh I think we have Ben's slide up next. slide up next. slide up next. Um, yes, there you go. Ben, I thought Um, yes, there you go. Ben, I thought Um, yes, there you go. Ben, I thought this was a really great analysis that this was a really great analysis that this was a really great analysis that you provided. Um, and I'd like you, if you provided. Um, and I'd like you, if you provided. Um, and I'd like you, if you could just walk through your you could just walk through your you could just walk through your analysis and hit some of the key points. analysis and hit some of the key points. analysis and hit some of the key points. I think what we've been talking about I think what we've been talking about I think what we've been talking about really resonates and and and ties into really resonates and and and ties into really resonates and and and ties into your points, your data points on the your points, your data points on the your points, your data points on the right. right. right. So, this was a chart I made uh at the So, this was a chart I made uh at the So, this was a chart I made uh at the beginning of the year. So, as a company, beginning of the year. So, as a company, beginning of the year. So, as a company, we are concerned about how many we are concerned about how many we are concerned about how many vulnerabilities are going to be out in vulnerabilities are going to be out in vulnerabilities are going to be out in the world, how many CVEes we're going to the world, how many CVEes we're going to the world, how many CVEes we're going to have to triage and look at for our have to triage and look at for our have to triage and look at for our customers, uh, for ourselves internally. customers, uh, for ourselves internally. customers, uh, for ourselves internally. Um, and so I took a shot at trying to Um, and so I took a shot at trying to Um, and so I took a shot at trying to see how many we would see in in 2025. see how many we would see in in 2025. see how many we would see in in 2025. Um, so on the left hand side, this is Um, so on the left hand side, this is Um, so on the left hand side, this is just kind of historical throughout the just kind of historical throughout the just kind of historical throughout the past about a year in the past. And then past about a year in the past. And then past about a year in the past. And then the red line is my shot at a model to the red line is my shot at a model to the red line is my shot at a model to predict how how large the CVE database predict how how large the CVE database predict how how large the CVE database will grow. Um, and again, um, Sandy is will grow. Um, and again, um, Sandy is will grow. Um, and again, um, Sandy is is blocking the punch line up in the is blocking the punch line up in the is blocking the punch line up in the upper right there, but it's about 3 upper right there, but it's about 3 upper right there, but it's about 3 330,000, I believe. Um, but the point 330,000, I believe. Um, but the point 330,000, I believe. Um, but the point being that it seems in sometimes being that it seems in sometimes being that it seems in sometimes overwhelming. It can it can feel hard, overwhelming. It can it can feel hard, overwhelming. It can it can feel hard, but I actually think this graph is is a but I actually think this graph is is a but I actually think this graph is is a great thing. Um, so I was reminded this great thing. Um, so I was reminded this great thing. Um, so I was reminded this morning of Mark Andre about 14 years ago morning of Mark Andre about 14 years ago morning of Mark Andre about 14 years ago saying software is eating the world. Um, saying software is eating the world. Um, saying software is eating the world. Um, and I think that's true today. And in and I think that's true today. And in and I think that's true today. And in fact, uh, Kayla gave a great talk on no fact, uh, Kayla gave a great talk on no fact, uh, Kayla gave a great talk on no code, uh, software generation. There are code, uh, software generation. There are code, uh, software generation. There are folks out here vibe coding, uh, which is folks out here vibe coding, uh, which is folks out here vibe coding, uh, which is terrifying. Um, so if anything, if terrifying. Um, so if anything, if terrifying. Um, so if anything, if software is eating the world, it has software is eating the world, it has software is eating the world, it has gotten more voracious. Um, and so we gotten more voracious. Um, and so we gotten more voracious. Um, and so we should be, as Bob said, looking to help should be, as Bob said, looking to help should be, as Bob said, looking to help folks make more secure software um, and folks make more secure software um, and folks make more secure software um, and try to stem that flow. However, um, we try to stem that flow. However, um, we try to stem that flow. However, um, we are also going to have to understand and are also going to have to understand and are also going to have to understand and react and communicate about the vans react and communicate about the vans react and communicate about the vans when they show up. Um, and I I want to when they show up. Um, and I I want to when they show up. Um, and I I want to see this as this is somewhat inevitable see this as this is somewhat inevitable see this as this is somewhat inevitable because we may fix some classes of because we may fix some classes of because we may fix some classes of vulnerabilities, but there are clever vulnerabilities, but there are clever vulnerabilities, but there are clever attackers out there who will come up attackers out there who will come up attackers out there who will come up with new ones that we have to deal with. with new ones that we have to deal with. with new ones that we have to deal with. Um, and we want visibility into as much Um, and we want visibility into as much Um, and we want visibility into as much as we can have. Uh, the CVE program as we can have. Uh, the CVE program as we can have. Uh, the CVE program really gives us a way to communicate really gives us a way to communicate really gives us a way to communicate about new vulnerabilities, right? So on about new vulnerabilities, right? So on about new vulnerabilities, right? So on on Bob's diagram, when we have a on Bob's diagram, when we have a on Bob's diagram, when we have a researcher find a new vulnerability in researcher find a new vulnerability in researcher find a new vulnerability in automatic tank gauges, as my colleague automatic tank gauges, as my colleague automatic tank gauges, as my colleague Pedro Lumbolino did, um, we need to be Pedro Lumbolino did, um, we need to be Pedro Lumbolino did, um, we need to be able to communicate with the vendor and able to communicate with the vendor and able to communicate with the vendor and say, "Hey, we found this." They can say, "Hey, we found this." They can say, "Hey, we found this." They can create a CVE ID. We can communicate with create a CVE ID. We can communicate with create a CVE ID. We can communicate with customers. Um, MITER can kind of put out customers. Um, MITER can kind of put out customers. Um, MITER can kind of put out alerts. Um, and they can also say this alerts. Um, and they can also say this alerts. Um, and they can also say this is patched. This is what you do to patch is patched. This is what you do to patch is patched. This is what you do to patch this CVE without a CVE ID. You're saying this CVE without a CVE ID. You're saying this CVE without a CVE ID. You're saying things like did you patch that Microsoft things like did you patch that Microsoft things like did you patch that Microsoft Exchange Exchange Exchange vulnerability? Which one? Oh, the recent vulnerability? Which one? Oh, the recent vulnerability? Which one? Oh, the recent one with a high high uh CVSS score. one with a high high uh CVSS score. one with a high high uh CVSS score. There's 34 of those in the latest There's 34 of those in the latest There's 34 of those in the latest version of Exchange. So, we need a an version of Exchange. So, we need a an version of Exchange. So, we need a an identifier to be able to communicate identifier to be able to communicate identifier to be able to communicate about these. And if we can't um we're about these. And if we can't um we're about these. And if we can't um we're gonna we're going to have a harder time. gonna we're going to have a harder time. gonna we're going to have a harder time. I am really grateful for the CVE program I am really grateful for the CVE program I am really grateful for the CVE program because it helps us g it grounds us in because it helps us g it grounds us in because it helps us g it grounds us in this way. Um we we gave a presentation this way. Um we we gave a presentation this way. Um we we gave a presentation last year, my colleague Sander Vinberg last year, my colleague Sander Vinberg last year, my colleague Sander Vinberg and I and he said something I think and I and he said something I think and I and he said something I think really really smart is that the lack of really really smart is that the lack of really really smart is that the lack of a CVE ID for a vulnerability essentially a CVE ID for a vulnerability essentially a CVE ID for a vulnerability essentially makes it like a potential zero day makes it like a potential zero day makes it like a potential zero day because you don't really have a way to because you don't really have a way to because you don't really have a way to communicate about it. you don't really communicate about it. you don't really communicate about it. you don't really have a way to understand what's have a way to understand what's have a way to understand what's happening in your ecosystem. Um I am happening in your ecosystem. Um I am happening in your ecosystem. Um I am very appreciative for the work of folks very appreciative for the work of folks very appreciative for the work of folks like Andrew Pollock and Jay Jacobs and like Andrew Pollock and Jay Jacobs and like Andrew Pollock and Jay Jacobs and others who are trying to understand what others who are trying to understand what others who are trying to understand what the best way to do that communication is the best way to do that communication is the best way to do that communication is um and how we can improve the CVE um and how we can improve the CVE um and how we can improve the CVE program for that communication. Um, so I program for that communication. Um, so I program for that communication. Um, so I see this increase as good and it'll give see this increase as good and it'll give see this increase as good and it'll give us better visibility as all this new us better visibility as all this new us better visibility as all this new software comes on board. Um, all these software comes on board. Um, all these software comes on board. Um, all these complexities come out, as we see new complexities come out, as we see new complexities come out, as we see new different kinds of attacks. I want to be different kinds of attacks. I want to be different kinds of attacks. I want to be able to catalog, look at, and able to catalog, look at, and able to catalog, look at, and communicate with everybody else about communicate with everybody else about communicate with everybody else about them. And without that communication, them. And without that communication, them. And without that communication, we're just we're going to be held in the we're just we're going to be held in the we're just we're going to be held in the dark. Um, and we that's that's not a dark. Um, and we that's that's not a dark. Um, and we that's that's not a good thing. That doesn't make us more good thing. That doesn't make us more good thing. That doesn't make us more secure. secure. secure. Hey, did it help that I turned my video Hey, did it help that I turned my video Hey, did it help that I turned my video off? It did. It did. All right. Look at off? It did. It did. All right. Look at off? It did. It did. All right. Look at that. Right there. Okay. Thank you. that. Right there. Okay. Thank you. that. Right there. Okay.

Um I know uh um Alec had some some Um I know uh um Alec had some some Um I know uh um Alec had some some points he wanted to hit on this slide points he wanted to hit on this slide points he wanted to hit on this slide and potentially even Bob. Um I think and potentially even Bob. Um I think and potentially even Bob. Um I think it's it's important to um recognize, you it's it's important to um recognize, you it's it's important to um recognize, you know, the the key points there on the know, the the key points there on the know, the the key points there on the right hand side. right hand side. right hand side. Yeah, I think you want me to go first. Yeah, I think you want me to go first. Yeah, I think you want me to go first. Let me just uh do a quick uh a quick Let me just uh do a quick uh a quick Let me just uh do a quick uh a quick little thing here. So, uh you mentioned little thing here. So, uh you mentioned little thing here. So, uh you mentioned Mark Andre. So, I used to work at Mark Andre. So, I used to work at Mark Andre. So, I used to work at Netscape. That's how old I am. And uh Netscape. That's how old I am. And uh Netscape. That's how old I am. And uh I'm I see people in the back googling. I'm I see people in the back googling. I'm I see people in the back googling. Um and what is Netscape? Um so, uh so so Um and what is Netscape? Um so, uh so so Um and what is Netscape? Um so, uh so so back in the day there was this uh this back in the day there was this uh this back in the day there was this uh this thing where um I guess it was some thing where um I guess it was some thing where um I guess it was some French researchers had uh over holiday French researchers had uh over holiday French researchers had uh over holiday break, they had uh grabbed a bunch of break, they had uh grabbed a bunch of break, they had uh grabbed a bunch of machines and they broke a 40-bit SSL machines and they broke a 40-bit SSL machines and they broke a 40-bit SSL connection. And there was a lot of news connection. And there was a lot of news connection. And there was a lot of news like, "Oh my god, they broke 40-bit like, "Oh my god, they broke 40-bit like, "Oh my god, they broke 40-bit SSL." And our reaction was, "Yeah, it's SSL." And our reaction was, "Yeah, it's SSL." And our reaction was, "Yeah, it's right on schedule. This is how we expect right on schedule. This is how we expect right on schedule. This is how we expect this to go." And so we're glad that our this to go." And so we're glad that our this to go." And so we're glad that our math has been correct. This is how math has been correct. This is how math has been correct. This is how Moore's law applies to cracking cracking Moore's law applies to cracking cracking Moore's law applies to cracking cracking RSA. So that was a that was a good piece RSA. So that was a that was a good piece RSA. So that was a that was a good piece of news. And so when I look at this, I of news. And so when I look at this, I of news. And so when I look at this, I also say, "Yeah, looks like we're right also say, "Yeah, looks like we're right also say, "Yeah, looks like we're right on track. We're increasing visibility. on track. We're increasing visibility. on track. We're increasing visibility. We're getting more insights into the We're getting more insights into the We're getting more insights into the software that is eating the world. And software that is eating the world. And software that is eating the world. And this is the right thing." Of course, this is the right thing." Of course, this is the right thing." Of course, NASA has got to talk more about quality. NASA has got to talk more about quality. NASA has got to talk more about quality. We got to talk much more about We got to talk much more about We got to talk much more about automation uh because there's no way automation uh because there's no way automation uh because there's no way that humans are going to be able to keep that humans are going to be able to keep that humans are going to be able to keep up with all of this throughout that up with all of this throughout that up with all of this throughout that entire ecosystem. And so, we got to entire ecosystem. And so, we got to entire ecosystem. And so, we got to figure out how to make sure that we have figure out how to make sure that we have figure out how to make sure that we have a strong bias towards machine a strong bias towards machine a strong bias towards machine readability and making sure the data is readability and making sure the data is readability and making sure the data is is correct and accurate and timely. is correct and accurate and timely. is correct and accurate and timely. You'll hear me say that those words You'll hear me say that those words You'll hear me say that those words correct, accurate, and timely over and correct, accurate, and timely over and correct, accurate, and timely over and over and over again uh in order to make over and over again uh in order to make over and over again uh in order to make sure that we have high quality. So, I I sure that we have high quality. So, I I sure that we have high quality. So, I I appreciate this graph because in my appreciate this graph because in my appreciate this graph because in my mind, it's another example of, yeah, mind, it's another example of, yeah, mind, it's another example of, yeah, we're kind of right on schedule. And so, we're kind of right on schedule. And so, we're kind of right on schedule. And so, yeah, thanks to everybody who who yeah, thanks to everybody who who yeah, thanks to everybody who who contributed to making this level of contributed to making this level of contributed to making this level of visibility possible. visibility possible. visibility possible. Yeah, I I don't know that I need to Yeah, I I don't know that I need to Yeah, I I don't know that I need to belabor a number of points. I agree with belabor a number of points. I agree with belabor a number of points. I agree with the points that have been made generally the points that have been made generally the points that have been made generally speaking. speaking. speaking. Um, and I think it's something to Um, and I think it's something to Um, and I think it's something to consider when I I will just tell one consider when I I will just tell one consider when I I will just tell one anecdote which is that sometimes there's anecdote which is that sometimes there's anecdote which is that sometimes there's an interpretation of more CNAs in the an interpretation of more CNAs in the an interpretation of more CNAs in the program causing more program causing more program causing more vulnerabilities. Um, and I think most in vulnerabilities. Um, and I think most in vulnerabilities. Um, and I think most in this room would realize that's not the this room would realize that's not the this room would realize that's not the right correlation to make. Um, it's right correlation to make. Um, it's right correlation to make. Um, it's definitely true that more CNAs uh definitely true that more CNAs uh definitely true that more CNAs uh conceptually can provide more vis conceptually can provide more vis conceptually can provide more vis visibility to vulnerabilities uh and and visibility to vulnerabilities uh and and visibility to vulnerabilities uh and and cover them. Um, and that's something cover them. Um, and that's something cover them. Um, and that's something that we try and do as we continue to that we try and do as we continue to that we try and do as we continue to federate and and maybe there'll be federate and and maybe there'll be federate and and maybe there'll be questions and discussions later about questions and discussions later about questions and discussions later about that. Um, because that's something that that. Um, because that's something that that. Um, because that's something that we're continuing to try and do and find we're continuing to try and do and find we're continuing to try and do and find a way to uh bring CNAs into the program a way to uh bring CNAs into the program a way to uh bring CNAs into the program that are ready and able that are ready and able that are ready and able um and have a demonstrable need to be um and have a demonstrable need to be um and have a demonstrable need to be CNAs and can contribute in the right CNAs and can contribute in the right CNAs and can contribute in the right kind of way. Um, and that's something kind of way. Um, and that's something kind of way. Um, and that's something that we want to continue to do um to that we want to continue to do um to that we want to continue to do um to manage what we're trying to deal with. manage what we're trying to deal with. manage what we're trying to deal with. So So So thank you for hitting that point because thank you for hitting that point because thank you for hitting that point because uh yeah I do hear that a lot where it's uh yeah I do hear that a lot where it's uh yeah I do hear that a lot where it's like you know oh there's so many like you know oh there's so many like you know oh there's so many vulnerabil there's so many CVEes well vulnerabil there's so many CVEes well vulnerabil there's so many CVEes well the more visibility we have the better the more visibility we have the better the more visibility we have the better ability we have to mitigate and defend ability we have to mitigate and defend ability we have to mitigate and defend against those vulnerabilities and um you against those vulnerabilities and um you against those vulnerabilities and um you know other otherwise it it's like what know other otherwise it it's like what know other otherwise it it's like what Ben said you know they're they're Ben said you know they're they're Ben said you know they're they're treated like a zero day because we can't treated like a zero day because we can't treated like a zero day because we can't see them. Um okay I think this this see them. Um okay I think this this see them. Um okay I think this this one's good. Uh let's move on to the next one's good. Uh let's move on to the next one's good. Uh let's move on to the next topic. Um so really just kind of topic. Um so really just kind of topic. Um so really just kind of bringing everything together with our bringing everything together with our bringing everything together with our northstar vision for the CVE program. Um northstar vision for the CVE program. Um northstar vision for the CVE program. Um you know we talked about federation but you know we talked about federation but you know we talked about federation but really it's not just to and to scale. really it's not just to and to scale. really it's not just to and to scale. It's not just to scale and federate just It's not just to scale and federate just It's not just to scale and federate just because um we really want to put because um we really want to put because um we really want to put intentionality behind how we're scaling intentionality behind how we're scaling intentionality behind how we're scaling and who we're um federating with um uh and who we're um federating with um uh and who we're um federating with um uh to be able to um you know create just to be able to um you know create just to be able to um you know create just this um the strong foundation and this um the strong foundation and this um the strong foundation and resilience for this program. Um you know resilience for this program. Um you know resilience for this program. Um you know building those partnerships. Um we've building those partnerships. Um we've building those partnerships. Um we've got uh you know definitely we've seen got uh you know definitely we've seen got uh you know definitely we've seen and I'm excited to show the next couple and I'm excited to show the next couple and I'm excited to show the next couple of analysis charts on um raising the bar of analysis charts on um raising the bar of analysis charts on um raising the bar for for data enrichment. Um and I really for for data enrichment. Um and I really for for data enrichment. Um and I really feel like kind of like right now we're feel like kind of like right now we're feel like kind of like right now we're in this completeness uh you know in this completeness uh you know in this completeness uh you know building up the completeness of the building up the completeness of the building up the completeness of the vulnerab or the CVE records but we vulnerab or the CVE records but we vulnerab or the CVE records but we really want to get to that quality and really want to get to that quality and really want to get to that quality and so you know we want to talk about you so you know we want to talk about you so you know we want to talk about you know how do we achieve that together as know how do we achieve that together as know how do we achieve that together as a community. Um, but these are really a community. Um, but these are really a community. Um, but these are really the three pillars that we are um focused the three pillars that we are um focused the three pillars that we are um focused on for the program. Uh, you know, Alec on for the program. Uh, you know, Alec on for the program. Uh, you know, Alec or Bob, do you have any any comments or or Bob, do you have any any comments or or Bob, do you have any any comments or anything you want to add to what I've um anything you want to add to what I've um anything you want to add to what I've um covered so far? Yeah, I I can jump in a covered so far? Yeah, I I can jump in a covered so far? Yeah, I I can jump in a little bit. So, um, when when Sy's little bit. So, um, when when Sy's little bit. So, um, when when Sy's talking about the intentional scaling, talking about the intentional scaling, talking about the intentional scaling, um, here's here's how I process this. um, here's here's how I process this. um, here's here's how I process this. there is um I think a great opportunity there is um I think a great opportunity there is um I think a great opportunity for us to really more strongly engage for us to really more strongly engage for us to really more strongly engage the software authors, publishers, the software authors, publishers, the software authors, publishers, commercial uh software manufacturers and commercial uh software manufacturers and commercial uh software manufacturers and the idea is that uh we think it's better the idea is that uh we think it's better the idea is that uh we think it's better and faster and cheaper for us to engage and faster and cheaper for us to engage and faster and cheaper for us to engage with them so that they can take with them so that they can take with them so that they can take ownership of the CVE records. Um and so ownership of the CVE records. Um and so ownership of the CVE records. Um and so when you think about the secure by when you think about the secure by when you think about the secure by design uh the the core principles there design uh the the core principles there design uh the the core principles there are three of them. The first one says are three of them. The first one says are three of them. The first one says that we want the companies to take that we want the companies to take that we want the companies to take ownership of their customers security ownership of their customers security ownership of their customers security outcomes. So we don't want just outcomes. So we don't want just outcomes. So we don't want just companies to produce some stuff. Here's companies to produce some stuff. Here's companies to produce some stuff. Here's your hardening guide. Off you go. Good your hardening guide. Off you go. Good your hardening guide. Off you go. Good luck. We want them to start to think luck. We want them to start to think luck. We want them to start to think about what is happening in the field and about what is happening in the field and about what is happening in the field and measure the success of companies using measure the success of companies using measure the success of companies using their software and services and to think their software and services and to think their software and services and to think about ways that they can make it easier about ways that they can make it easier about ways that they can make it easier for the defenders to defend as opposed for the defenders to defend as opposed for the defenders to defend as opposed to throwing them a binder and saying to throwing them a binder and saying to throwing them a binder and saying knock yourselves out. And so to that knock yourselves out. And so to that knock yourselves out. And so to that end, getting the commercial companies to end, getting the commercial companies to end, getting the commercial companies to be CNAs for their products has been an be CNAs for their products has been an be CNAs for their products has been an effort. And so with our secure by design effort. And so with our secure by design effort. And so with our secure by design pledge, we have worked to sign up pledge, we have worked to sign up pledge, we have worked to sign up companies uh around seven core things companies uh around seven core things companies uh around seven core things that we want them to do. Won't go into that we want them to do. Won't go into that we want them to do. Won't go into that now, but um but one of those that now, but um but one of those that now, but um but one of those involves uh better uh recordkeeping and involves uh better uh recordkeeping and involves uh better uh recordkeeping and making sure that they're CNAs. And so making sure that they're CNAs. And so making sure that they're CNAs. And so we've been working with a whole bunch of we've been working with a whole bunch of we've been working with a whole bunch of uh commercial companies that have not uh commercial companies that have not uh commercial companies that have not been CNAs to get them enrolled. And so been CNAs to get them enrolled. And so been CNAs to get them enrolled. And so we'll keep going through that process. we'll keep going through that process. we'll keep going through that process. Um we need to find ways to scale that Um we need to find ways to scale that Um we need to find ways to scale that because there are many commercial because there are many commercial because there are many commercial companies and we're not going to be able companies and we're not going to be able companies and we're not going to be able to do that on our own. So if folks have to do that on our own. So if folks have to do that on our own. So if folks have ideas, you know, please reach out. So I ideas, you know, please reach out. So I ideas, you know, please reach out. So I think making sure that we're being very think making sure that we're being very think making sure that we're being very intentional about how we're scaling is a intentional about how we're scaling is a intentional about how we're scaling is a key part of a key part of that. Um with key part of a key part of that. Um with key part of a key part of that. Um with regard to regard to regard to enrichment, so I think of enrichment enrichment, so I think of enrichment enrichment, so I think of enrichment maybe a little bit differently than some maybe a little bit differently than some maybe a little bit differently than some folks. And I don't know if it's better folks. And I don't know if it's better folks. And I don't know if it's better or not. It's just I this is how my brain or not. It's just I this is how my brain or not. It's just I this is how my brain works. So when I think about enrichment, works. So when I think about enrichment, works. So when I think about enrichment, I think about taking something that's I think about taking something that's I think about taking something that's already in a good place and adding already in a good place and adding already in a good place and adding something to it that the CNA may not something to it that the CNA may not something to it that the CNA may not have had the position to to contribute. have had the position to to contribute. have had the position to to contribute. So for example, in my mind, if the So for example, in my mind, if the So for example, in my mind, if the product uh if the CVE doesn't list the product uh if the CVE doesn't list the product uh if the CVE doesn't list the products, if it doesn't list, you know, products, if it doesn't list, you know, products, if it doesn't list, you know, what the the manufacturer is, if it what the the manufacturer is, if it what the the manufacturer is, if it doesn't have some of these core values, doesn't have some of these core values, doesn't have some of these core values, it's malnourished. And so I I think I it's malnourished. And so I I think I it's malnourished. And so I I think I don't want to call adding those things don't want to call adding those things don't want to call adding those things enrichment. I mean that just kind of enrichment. I mean that just kind of enrichment. I mean that just kind of should be there from the beginning. should be there from the beginning. should be there from the beginning. Things like is this particular CVE being Things like is this particular CVE being Things like is this particular CVE being actively exploited? That's not something actively exploited? That's not something actively exploited? That's not something that most CNAs and most commercial that most CNAs and most commercial that most CNAs and most commercial companies would have visibility into. I companies would have visibility into. I companies would have visibility into. I mean they may but it's not something mean they may but it's not something mean they may but it's not something that most would have the you know the that most would have the you know the that most would have the you know the network connections and the kind of network connections and the kind of network connections and the kind of sophistication in order to really be sophistication in order to really be sophistication in order to really be able to tell that. So other agencies and able to tell that. So other agencies and able to tell that. So other agencies and commercial companies may be in in a very commercial companies may be in in a very commercial companies may be in in a very very good position to explain that yes very good position to explain that yes very good position to explain that yes this is this is particularly dangerous this is this is particularly dangerous this is this is particularly dangerous and is being actively exploited. Here and is being actively exploited. Here and is being actively exploited. Here are the the uh here are the TTPs that are the the uh here are the TTPs that are the the uh here are the TTPs that the attackers are using. There's all the attackers are using. There's all the attackers are using. There's all sorts of stuff that you can imagine sorts of stuff that you can imagine sorts of stuff that you can imagine somebody adding on top of a of a well somebody adding on top of a of a well somebody adding on top of a of a well fortified CVE record that would in my fortified CVE record that would in my fortified CVE record that would in my mind qualify for the word enrichment. So mind qualify for the word enrichment. So mind qualify for the word enrichment. So that may not be the way that you define that may not be the way that you define that may not be the way that you define it, but that's just kind of in my head it, but that's just kind of in my head it, but that's just kind of in my head uh where I go. I want to have a solid uh where I go. I want to have a solid uh where I go. I want to have a solid foundation and then enrichment is is foundation and then enrichment is is foundation and then enrichment is is something based on top of that. So we do something based on top of that. So we do something based on top of that. So we do need to continue to raise that bar and need to continue to raise that bar and need to continue to raise that bar and then quality um again I think about then quality um again I think about then quality um again I think about quality as being a function of those quality as being a function of those quality as being a function of those three things. CVE records being complete three things. CVE records being complete three things. CVE records being complete and complete can be a few things. and complete can be a few things. and complete can be a few things. Complete can be that you filled out Complete can be that you filled out Complete can be that you filled out enough fields that the defenders have a enough fields that the defenders have a enough fields that the defenders have a chance to use their tools to actually do chance to use their tools to actually do chance to use their tools to actually do something to reduce the risk but it can something to reduce the risk but it can something to reduce the risk but it can also be making sure that all of the also be making sure that all of the also be making sure that all of the vulnerabilities are presented. And so vulnerabilities are presented. And so vulnerabilities are presented. And so not every CNA publishes all the CVE not every CNA publishes all the CVE not every CNA publishes all the CVE records for defects that they find. If a records for defects that they find. If a records for defects that they find. If a software company finds one that uh they software company finds one that uh they software company finds one that uh they discovered in-house. Sometimes they discovered in-house. Sometimes they discovered in-house. Sometimes they don't do that. Um I do think that when a don't do that. Um I do think that when a don't do that. Um I do think that when a customer is potentially uh at risk, it customer is potentially uh at risk, it customer is potentially uh at risk, it behooves them to actually publish a CVE behooves them to actually publish a CVE behooves them to actually publish a CVE record even if they think that they have record even if they think that they have record even if they think that they have no evidence that it has been exploited. no evidence that it has been exploited. no evidence that it has been exploited. Um I I think it just is important to Um I I think it just is important to Um I I think it just is important to have the entire picture so that have the entire picture so that have the entire picture so that defenders can go through whatever they defenders can go through whatever they defenders can go through whatever they need to do in order to satisfy need to do in order to satisfy need to do in order to satisfy themselves that they haven't been uh you themselves that they haven't been uh you themselves that they haven't been uh you know a victim of those kinds of things. know a victim of those kinds of things. know a victim of those kinds of things. So complete can be a few things. Um and So complete can be a few things. Um and So complete can be a few things. Um and then accurate uh that can also mean a then accurate uh that can also mean a then accurate uh that can also mean a few things. I think of accuracy as uh few things. I think of accuracy as uh few things. I think of accuracy as uh providing the right kind of information providing the right kind of information providing the right kind of information and hopefully not needing to change it and hopefully not needing to change it and hopefully not needing to change it too often but if it you know piece of too often but if it you know piece of too often but if it you know piece of information comes along correcting it so information comes along correcting it so information comes along correcting it so it becomes now accurate again is going it becomes now accurate again is going it becomes now accurate again is going to be key and I think about things like to be key and I think about things like to be key and I think about things like the the CWE obviously I think a lot the the CWE obviously I think a lot the the CWE obviously I think a lot about the CWE so uh secure by design about the CWE so uh secure by design about the CWE so uh secure by design doesn't happen if we don't start to get doesn't happen if we don't start to get doesn't happen if we don't start to get to root causes and taking a look at to root causes and taking a look at to root causes and taking a look at those recurring classes of defect so the those recurring classes of defect so the those recurring classes of defect so the CWE is a very very important thing to to CWE is a very very important thing to to CWE is a very very important thing to to my way of thinking my way of thinking my way of thinking And you know we we may talk about this a And you know we we may talk about this a And you know we we may talk about this a bit. I sort of defer to to the actual bit. I sort of defer to to the actual bit. I sort of defer to to the actual expert over there but you know there are expert over there but you know there are expert over there but you know there are places where and I've talked to places where and I've talked to places where and I've talked to companies who say yeah you know we'll companies who say yeah you know we'll companies who say yeah you know we'll provide the coarsest grain C.WE possible provide the coarsest grain C.WE possible provide the coarsest grain C.WE possible and I thank them for producing a C.WE. I and I thank them for producing a C.WE. I and I thank them for producing a C.WE. I think that's helpful, but I think as an think that's helpful, but I think as an think that's helpful, but I think as an industry, we need to understand the fine industry, we need to understand the fine industry, we need to understand the fine grain uh problems that we're that we're grain uh problems that we're that we're grain uh problems that we're that we're seeing companies and and open source seeing companies and and open source seeing companies and and open source projects running into so that we can ask projects running into so that we can ask projects running into so that we can ask ourselves how do we collectively come ourselves how do we collectively come ourselves how do we collectively come together to eliminate this particular together to eliminate this particular together to eliminate this particular class. And so accuracy can also mean the class. And so accuracy can also mean the class. And so accuracy can also mean the level of precision for some of these level of precision for some of these level of precision for some of these pieces of information. Uh and timeliness pieces of information. Uh and timeliness pieces of information. Uh and timeliness um is just kind of what it says. you um is just kind of what it says. you um is just kind of what it says. you know, did did the company the the CNA know, did did the company the the CNA know, did did the company the the CNA produce the CBE record uh as soon as produce the CBE record uh as soon as produce the CBE record uh as soon as they could, as soon as it was reasonable they could, as soon as it was reasonable they could, as soon as it was reasonable uh or did they delay it? I talked to one uh or did they delay it? I talked to one uh or did they delay it? I talked to one company who had um inadvertently not company who had um inadvertently not company who had um inadvertently not published a uh CVE record for an published a uh CVE record for an published a uh CVE record for an extended period of time. And so when I extended period of time. And so when I extended period of time. And so when I talked to them, uh it turns out they had talked to them, uh it turns out they had talked to them, uh it turns out they had uh some disconnects between some of uh some disconnects between some of uh some disconnects between some of their runbooks between a couple of their runbooks between a couple of their runbooks between a couple of different teams. And when we brought different teams. And when we brought different teams. And when we brought this to their attention, they went back this to their attention, they went back this to their attention, they went back and and clarified in each of the and and clarified in each of the and and clarified in each of the runbooks what what the handoff is within runbooks what what the handoff is within runbooks what what the handoff is within their organization to make sure that their organization to make sure that their organization to make sure that that doesn't happen again. And this goes that doesn't happen again. And this goes that doesn't happen again. And this goes back to one of my other experiences, back to one of my other experiences, back to one of my other experiences, which is I am so impressed with all of which is I am so impressed with all of which is I am so impressed with all of the the CNAs that I talk to when I say the the CNAs that I talk to when I say the the CNAs that I talk to when I say here's this little hiccup, they go and here's this little hiccup, they go and here's this little hiccup, they go and they take action. And so sometimes I they take action. And so sometimes I they take action. And so sometimes I hear this this uh this fear of talking hear this this uh this fear of talking hear this this uh this fear of talking to CNAs and saying can you please raise to CNAs and saying can you please raise to CNAs and saying can you please raise the bar a little bit. My personal the bar a little bit. My personal the bar a little bit. My personal experience is that when I talk to them experience is that when I talk to them experience is that when I talk to them they step up. And so I think that is a they step up. And so I think that is a they step up. And so I think that is a testament to the foundation that you've testament to the foundation that you've testament to the foundation that you've all been laying over the last 25 years. all been laying over the last 25 years. all been laying over the last 25 years. I'm sort of new to this but it is an I'm sort of new to this but it is an I'm sort of new to this but it is an incredible testament and I would incredible testament and I would incredible testament and I would encourage all of you to think a lot more encourage all of you to think a lot more encourage all of you to think a lot more about um how we can work together to about um how we can work together to about um how we can work together to raise to raise that level of quality. raise to raise that level of quality. raise to raise that level of quality. And yeah, and I want to I want to say And yeah, and I want to I want to say And yeah, and I want to I want to say from a SISA perspective, the raising the from a SISA perspective, the raising the from a SISA perspective, the raising the data enrichment bar, we're we're taking data enrichment bar, we're we're taking data enrichment bar, we're we're taking that very seriously too with full that very seriously too with full that very seriously too with full enrichment, I think you've heard some of enrichment, I think you've heard some of enrichment, I think you've heard some of the talks there this week. Um, you know, the talks there this week. Um, you know, the talks there this week. Um, you know, how we've been intentionally um putting how we've been intentionally um putting how we've been intentionally um putting the SSVC what our SSVC scoring is into the SSVC what our SSVC scoring is into the SSVC what our SSVC scoring is into the CVE records. Um, we're we're really the CVE records. Um, we're we're really the CVE records. Um, we're we're really promoting that um decision tree uh promoting that um decision tree uh promoting that um decision tree uh framework. Um, talking to other partners framework. Um, talking to other partners framework. Um, talking to other partners in the community. um you know you know in the community. um you know you know in the community. um you know you know trying to get the word out about how trying to get the word out about how trying to get the word out about how folks can implement that in their own folks can implement that in their own folks can implement that in their own organizations um by leveraging our organizations um by leveraging our organizations um by leveraging our initial analysis with SSVC of course Kev initial analysis with SSVC of course Kev initial analysis with SSVC of course Kev we're continuing on with that um and we're continuing on with that um and we're continuing on with that um and just looking towards you you know just looking towards you you know just looking towards you you know towards the future of of providing any towards the future of of providing any towards the future of of providing any kind of an additional um because we are kind of an additional um because we are kind of an additional um because we are an operational um agency uh we we have an operational um agency uh we we have an operational um agency uh we we have that operational value that we can add that operational value that we can add that operational value that we can add to the records and we want to continue to the records and we want to continue to the records and we want to continue to grow down that path. to grow down that path. to grow down that path. um by adding what we can into the um by adding what we can into the um by adding what we can into the records. Um sorry, Alec, were you records. Um sorry, Alec, were you records. Um sorry, Alec, were you getting ready to say something? Yeah, getting ready to say something? Yeah, getting ready to say something? Yeah, I'd be happy to say something. I I think I'd be happy to say something. I I think I'd be happy to say something. I I think firstly I can't speak on behalf of CISA. firstly I can't speak on behalf of CISA. firstly I can't speak on behalf of CISA. I also can't really speak on behalf of I also can't really speak on behalf of I also can't really speak on behalf of the CVE program, but I can speak as as a the CVE program, but I can speak as as a the CVE program, but I can speak as as a member of it and and wearing a couple member of it and and wearing a couple member of it and and wearing a couple hats within it. Um I think when we talk hats within it. Um I think when we talk hats within it. Um I think when we talk about quality there, you know, I I had a about quality there, you know, I I had a about quality there, you know, I I had a talk earlier this week that was sort of talk earlier this week that was sort of talk earlier this week that was sort of talking about the changing definition of talking about the changing definition of talking about the changing definition of completeness, but completeness is not completeness, but completeness is not completeness, but completeness is not quality. Uh, and that's an important quality. Uh, and that's an important quality. Uh, and that's an important thing to recognize. There there's steps thing to recognize. There there's steps thing to recognize. There there's steps to move forward on all of these things. to move forward on all of these things. to move forward on all of these things. Um, but completeness is a sense, and Um, but completeness is a sense, and Um, but completeness is a sense, and I'll echo maybe a point Bob made, which I'll echo maybe a point Bob made, which I'll echo maybe a point Bob made, which is that providing information within the is that providing information within the is that providing information within the CVE record is really best done by those CVE record is really best done by those CVE record is really best done by those who can do it best. Uh, and many ways a who can do it best. Uh, and many ways a who can do it best. Uh, and many ways a lot of those data elements are best lot of those data elements are best lot of those data elements are best provided by the CNA. So when we think provided by the CNA. So when we think provided by the CNA. So when we think about a new kind of completeness, this about a new kind of completeness, this about a new kind of completeness, this is inherent sort of short version thesis is inherent sort of short version thesis is inherent sort of short version thesis of of some of the data that I was of of some of the data that I was of of some of the data that I was presenting is that we're seeing uh presenting is that we're seeing uh presenting is that we're seeing uh partly because of the demand I think partly because of the demand I think partly because of the demand I think from downstream that uh more CNAs are from downstream that uh more CNAs are from downstream that uh more CNAs are now providing some of this data that was now providing some of this data that was now providing some of this data that was not necessarily required and may you not necessarily required and may you not necessarily required and may you know I mean it's not necessarily know I mean it's not necessarily know I mean it's not necessarily something fulfilling a requirement but something fulfilling a requirement but something fulfilling a requirement but sort of understanding that there is a sort of understanding that there is a sort of understanding that there is a value in providing C.WE we information value in providing C.WE we information value in providing C.WE we information providing uh CVSS information uh and providing uh CVSS information uh and providing uh CVSS information uh and other kinds of data uh information let's other kinds of data uh information let's other kinds of data uh information let's say vulnerability metadata and really say vulnerability metadata and really say vulnerability metadata and really the CNA being best positioned to provide the CNA being best positioned to provide the CNA being best positioned to provide a number of that those data elements uh a number of that those data elements uh a number of that those data elements uh and and to Sandy's point and Bob's point and and to Sandy's point and Bob's point and and to Sandy's point and Bob's point earlier sometimes there's other data earlier sometimes there's other data earlier sometimes there's other data elements that are best provided by by elements that are best provided by by elements that are best provided by by others the other thing that I'll say others the other thing that I'll say others the other thing that I'll say about federation and and growth about federation and and growth about federation and and growth continuing um continuing um continuing um again not speaking for CISA not speaking again not speaking for CISA not speaking again not speaking for CISA not speaking for the CBE program But recognizing that for the CBE program But recognizing that for the CBE program But recognizing that part of what federation means as it part of what federation means as it part of what federation means as it continues in its 25th year or maybe not continues in its 25th year or maybe not continues in its 25th year or maybe not even its 20 I guess federation started even its 20 I guess federation started even its 20 I guess federation started so 2016. So acknowledging that it's not so 2016. So acknowledging that it's not so 2016. So acknowledging that it's not only more CNAs but it's evolving roles only more CNAs but it's evolving roles only more CNAs but it's evolving roles of CNAs maybe evolving and growing the of CNAs maybe evolving and growing the of CNAs maybe evolving and growing the root community within the structure if root community within the structure if root community within the structure if you're aware of that structure and you you're aware of that structure and you you're aware of that structure and you can go to the website to to learn more can go to the website to to learn more can go to the website to to learn more about how this all sort of works as a about how this all sort of works as a about how this all sort of works as a federated program. federated program. federated program. um and other entities that help the um and other entities that help the um and other entities that help the ecosystem uh you know the idea of ecosystem uh you know the idea of ecosystem uh you know the idea of federating roots federating CNLRs the federating roots federating CNLRs the federating roots federating CNLRs the functions of the program to enable functions of the program to enable functions of the program to enable better downstream user experience and better downstream user experience and better downstream user experience and ability to respond um its mission ability to respond um its mission ability to respond um its mission remains the same the program uh does but remains the same the program uh does but remains the same the program uh does but I think when we talk about the quality I think when we talk about the quality I think when we talk about the quality era there's a lot of details in there era there's a lot of details in there era there's a lot of details in there when we talk about continuing federation when we talk about continuing federation when we talk about continuing federation and intentional federation uh what that and intentional federation uh what that and intentional federation uh what that means is is maybe a different thing now means is is maybe a different thing now means is is maybe a different thing now than it was uh back in 2016 or than it was uh back in 2016 or than it was uh back in 2016 or 1999. So, and it's it really is 1999. So, and it's it really is 1999. So, and it's it really is necessary um for us to do that. I I necessary um for us to do that. I I necessary um for us to do that. I I really believe in this strategy. It's we really believe in this strategy. It's we really believe in this strategy. It's we cannot I mean, as a community, this cannot I mean, as a community, this cannot I mean, as a community, this foundation that we've built here over foundation that we've built here over foundation that we've built here over the last 25 years has been um it just we the last 25 years has been um it just we the last 25 years has been um it just we should be really proud of of what what should be really proud of of what what should be really proud of of what what we've brought to the ecosystem. Um you we've brought to the ecosystem. Um you we've brought to the ecosystem. Um you know we really are the leaders and uh know we really are the leaders and uh know we really are the leaders and uh you know the all the other um uh you know the all the other um uh you know the all the other um uh entities out there external uh entities out there external uh entities out there external uh government other governments look to us government other governments look to us government other governments look to us and I think that's really a special um and I think that's really a special um and I think that's really a special um honor for us to have as a community. Um honor for us to have as a community. Um honor for us to have as a community. Um okay I think I we're going to pivot a okay I think I we're going to pivot a okay I think I we're going to pivot a little bit into data uh data. Um I think little bit into data uh data. Um I think little bit into data uh data. Um I think we have some analysis up next. Um I we have some analysis up next. Um I we have some analysis up next. Um I think it's Ben's slide. Yeah, Ben, can think it's Ben's slide. Yeah, Ben, can think it's Ben's slide. Yeah, Ben, can you talk about this a little bit? you talk about this a little bit? you talk about this a little bit? Absolutely. Uh Bob, can I borrow the Absolutely. Uh Bob, can I borrow the Absolutely. Uh Bob, can I borrow the laser pointer? Oh, and I'm gonna stand laser pointer? Oh, and I'm gonna stand laser pointer? Oh, and I'm gonna stand up so I'm a moving target. Um so, uh up so I'm a moving target. Um so, uh up so I'm a moving target. Um so, uh last year, um when NVD was was last year, um when NVD was was last year, um when NVD was was struggling to keep up with some of the struggling to keep up with some of the struggling to keep up with some of the volume they were facing, um we wanted to volume they were facing, um we wanted to volume they were facing, um we wanted to look at how complete records were from look at how complete records were from look at how complete records were from other sources and particularly how other sources and particularly how other sources and particularly how complete records were from CNAs. complete records were from CNAs. complete records were from CNAs. Um and so what we what I did is I pulled Um and so what we what I did is I pulled Um and so what we what I did is I pulled the CNA data uh from the CVE list and the CNA data uh from the CVE list and the CNA data uh from the CVE list and asked what percentage of vulnerabilities asked what percentage of vulnerabilities asked what percentage of vulnerabilities have a particular field filled in. So have a particular field filled in. So have a particular field filled in. So this is about completeness. This is not this is about completeness. This is not this is about completeness. This is not necessarily about quality and I'll make necessarily about quality and I'll make necessarily about quality and I'll make that distinction here with maybe one that distinction here with maybe one that distinction here with maybe one exception. Um I I'm sure this has been exception. Um I I'm sure this has been exception. Um I I'm sure this has been stated several times while we've been stated several times while we've been stated several times while we've been here, but there are only really three here, but there are only really three here, but there are only really three required fields in the CVE schema. the required fields in the CVE schema. the required fields in the CVE schema. the description references and some an an description references and some an an description references and some an an array of affected which tells us a array of affected which tells us a array of affected which tells us a little about the product vendor versions little about the product vendor versions little about the product vendor versions or whatever. So um this is what we tried or whatever. So um this is what we tried or whatever. So um this is what we tried to look at is the percentage of CVEes to look at is the percentage of CVEes to look at is the percentage of CVEes over time where the CNA is providing over time where the CNA is providing over time where the CNA is providing this information. Now this is a subset this information. Now this is a subset this information. Now this is a subset of the CVE information. There's how many of the CVE information. There's how many of the CVE information. There's how many fields uh Alec? How many fields are in fields uh Alec? How many fields are in fields uh Alec? How many fields are in the schema? the schema? the schema? A lot. A lot. Um A lot. A lot. Um A lot. A lot. Um uh but what we found is going back to uh but what we found is going back to uh but what we found is going back to the start of the CNA program or the the start of the CNA program or the the start of the CNA program or the start of the kind of modern era of the start of the kind of modern era of the start of the kind of modern era of the CNA program CNA program CNA program um is that we've seen this great um is that we've seen this great um is that we've seen this great increase in things the most basic things increase in things the most basic things increase in things the most basic things the product and vendor. So this is the product and vendor. So this is the product and vendor. So this is excluding um vulnerabilities where excluding um vulnerabilities where excluding um vulnerabilities where occasionally that product and vendor occasionally that product and vendor occasionally that product and vendor field gets filled in with NA as in we field gets filled in with NA as in we field gets filled in with NA as in we don't know because we're the CNA of last don't know because we're the CNA of last don't know because we're the CNA of last resort who's actually doing this and um resort who's actually doing this and um resort who's actually doing this and um we're just trying to get that we're just trying to get that we're just trying to get that communication effort out there. Uh but communication effort out there. Uh but communication effort out there. Uh but the good news is um recently as of this the good news is um recently as of this the good news is um recently as of this year 90% of CVEes have that information year 90% of CVEes have that information year 90% of CVEes have that information in them. Now similarly uh we you know we in them. Now similarly uh we you know we in them. Now similarly uh we you know we also have similar version information. also have similar version information. also have similar version information. Um we're seeing a massive increase in Um we're seeing a massive increase in Um we're seeing a massive increase in CNAs putting in C.WE information and CNAs putting in C.WE information and CNAs putting in C.WE information and CVSS information and that's up to like CVSS information and that's up to like CVSS information and that's up to like 85%. So we are seeing CNAs move towards 85%. So we are seeing CNAs move towards 85%. So we are seeing CNAs move towards this completeness and it is really this completeness and it is really this completeness and it is really positive because when I as a vendor I'm positive because when I as a vendor I'm positive because when I as a vendor I'm trying to communicate with customers trying to communicate with customers trying to communicate with customers about what a CVE is. If I can get this about what a CVE is. If I can get this about what a CVE is. If I can get this information directly from the CNA who is information directly from the CNA who is information directly from the CNA who is usually the vendor um that that is an usually the vendor um that that is an usually the vendor um that that is an authoritative source that I can be sure authoritative source that I can be sure authoritative source that I can be sure of um and help communicate those things. of um and help communicate those things. of um and help communicate those things. Um I'm also there's this gray line which Um I'm also there's this gray line which Um I'm also there's this gray line which I apologize for being so light um and it I apologize for being so light um and it I apologize for being so light um and it has gone down. this is other problem has gone down. this is other problem has gone down. this is other problem types. Um, and I actually see this types. Um, and I actually see this types. Um, and I actually see this decline in completeness of that decline in completeness of that decline in completeness of that field. Excuse me as as a positive field. Excuse me as as a positive field. Excuse me as as a positive because this is a proxy for C.WE and it because this is a proxy for C.WE and it because this is a proxy for C.WE and it is um less structured, we'll say. Um, is um less structured, we'll say. Um, is um less structured, we'll say. Um, and so I'm glad to see CNA's kind of and so I'm glad to see CNA's kind of and so I'm glad to see CNA's kind of stopping this and moving towards stopping this and moving towards stopping this and moving towards something that is more uh universally something that is more uh universally something that is more uh universally accepted. Um, I'm going to say one more accepted. Um, I'm going to say one more accepted. Um, I'm going to say one more thing. This is not about uh quality. Um, thing. This is not about uh quality. Um, thing. This is not about uh quality. Um, this is not to say that the CBSS scores this is not to say that the CBSS scores this is not to say that the CBSS scores are version one, two or or version two, are version one, two or or version two, are version one, two or or version two, three or four. It's not to say that they three or four. It's not to say that they three or four. It's not to say that they are an accurate reflection of what the are an accurate reflection of what the are an accurate reflection of what the CVE should be. Um, it may be higher, it CVE should be. Um, it may be higher, it CVE should be. Um, it may be higher, it may be lower. Um, I'll also say that, may be lower. Um, I'll also say that, may be lower. Um, I'll also say that, you know, versions are difficult and you know, versions are difficult and you know, versions are difficult and they come in many formats. Um, and they come in many formats. Um, and they come in many formats. Um, and everybody has their own release schedule everybody has their own release schedule everybody has their own release schedule and release tagging and so what version and release tagging and so what version and release tagging and so what version the CVE affects is also a very difficult the CVE affects is also a very difficult the CVE affects is also a very difficult thing to unify. So, I'm not saying thing to unify. So, I'm not saying thing to unify. So, I'm not saying there's quality there. Um, as mentioned, there's quality there. Um, as mentioned, there's quality there. Um, as mentioned, C.WE is not just a list of weaknesses. C.WE is not just a list of weaknesses. C.WE is not just a list of weaknesses. It is a full-on hierarchy of views, and It is a full-on hierarchy of views, and It is a full-on hierarchy of views, and there are ones that are intended to be there are ones that are intended to be there are ones that are intended to be used um for individual CVEEs, and that's used um for individual CVEEs, and that's used um for individual CVEEs, and that's not always the case here. Um, but I see not always the case here. Um, but I see not always the case here. Um, but I see this improving completeness as a as a this improving completeness as a as a this improving completeness as a as a really good quality thing that will help really good quality thing that will help really good quality thing that will help us communicate about stuff. It gives us us communicate about stuff. It gives us us communicate about stuff. It gives us an idea of kind of what what vitamins an idea of kind of what what vitamins an idea of kind of what what vitamins we're malnutritioned in. Are we we're malnutritioned in. Are we we're malnutritioned in. Are we deficient in vitamin C or CVSS? Uh, and deficient in vitamin C or CVSS? Uh, and deficient in vitamin C or CVSS? Uh, and the great thing is we're addressing C.WE the great thing is we're addressing C.WE the great thing is we're addressing C.WE CVE hunger. CVE hunger. CVE hunger. Yeah, I love that analogy. Um, thank Yeah, I love that analogy. Um, thank Yeah, I love that analogy. Um, thank you, Ben. Um, on the completeness topic, you, Ben. Um, on the completeness topic, you, Ben. Um, on the completeness topic, I think we have a we have another chart I think we have a we have another chart I think we have a we have another chart and I I'll hide my my picture here in a and I I'll hide my my picture here in a and I I'll hide my my picture here in a second. Um, Alec and and um and Bob, can second. Um, Alec and and um and Bob, can second. Um, Alec and and um and Bob, can you talk about this analysis? This is you talk about this analysis? This is you talk about this analysis? This is something the one point I'll make before something the one point I'll make before something the one point I'll make before I I hide my my uh video is that you know I I hide my my uh video is that you know I I hide my my uh video is that you know we are really taking a deeper look at we are really taking a deeper look at we are really taking a deeper look at this. We're you know a deeper look at this. We're you know a deeper look at this. We're you know a deeper look at the data within the CVE database and I the data within the CVE database and I the data within the CVE database and I think that's important for everyone to think that's important for everyone to think that's important for everyone to know that we are measuring this um you know that we are measuring this um you know that we are measuring this um you know we're looking at the completeness know we're looking at the completeness know we're looking at the completeness and how can we work with you as a and how can we work with you as a and how can we work with you as a community to raise the bar here. Are community to raise the bar here. Are community to raise the bar here. Are there things we can do um at SISA and there things we can do um at SISA and there things we can do um at SISA and working with the CVE program um and the working with the CVE program um and the working with the CVE program um and the board and the community partners to board and the community partners to board and the community partners to raise it? Um and I I I want us to hit a raise it? Um and I I I want us to hit a raise it? Um and I I I want us to hit a little bit on the standard of little bit on the standard of little bit on the standard of completeness. I know Ben talked about completeness. I know Ben talked about completeness. I know Ben talked about what he was measuring. Um I want Bob to what he was measuring. Um I want Bob to what he was measuring. Um I want Bob to talk about what we're measuring um here talk about what we're measuring um here talk about what we're measuring um here at SISA. Um is there is there a little at SISA. Um is there is there a little at SISA. Um is there is there a little bit of a difference? Um what do we look bit of a difference? Um what do we look bit of a difference? Um what do we look at? um should we look at more fields um at? um should we look at more fields um at? um should we look at more fields um for completeness um and and that kind of for completeness um and and that kind of for completeness um and and that kind of thing? Over to you Bob. Uh so this these thing? Over to you Bob. Uh so this these thing? Over to you Bob. Uh so this these are some uh pictures from some internal are some uh pictures from some internal are some uh pictures from some internal dashboards. We've been talking about dashboards. We've been talking about dashboards. We've been talking about things like automation and so we're things like automation and so we're things like automation and so we're trying to get a lot better at data trying to get a lot better at data trying to get a lot better at data visualization. We are not up to the Ben visualization. We are not up to the Ben visualization. We are not up to the Ben Edwards standards but uh we're we're Edwards standards but uh we're we're Edwards standards but uh we're we're we're working on it. Uh we're working on it. Uh we're working on it. Uh yeah, absolutely. So, uh, we're we're yeah, absolutely. So, uh, we're we're yeah, absolutely. So, uh, we're we're going to continue to evolve these things going to continue to evolve these things going to continue to evolve these things to give us better insights into what's to give us better insights into what's to give us better insights into what's actually happening. So, I think the actually happening. So, I think the actually happening. So, I think the first item here, which is around CVES first item here, which is around CVES first item here, which is around CVES published with CWES, the one on the on published with CWES, the one on the on published with CWES, the one on the on the bottom left, uh, that number the bottom left, uh, that number the bottom left, uh, that number continues to grow, which is consistent continues to grow, which is consistent continues to grow, which is consistent with with your findings. And so, uh, with with your findings. And so, uh, with with your findings. And so, uh, thank you for for all the CNAs who are thank you for for all the CNAs who are thank you for for all the CNAs who are starting to work to add these additional starting to work to add these additional starting to work to add these additional characteristics so that the communities characteristics so that the communities characteristics so that the communities and the defenders can can really and the defenders can can really and the defenders can can really understand better what is happening uh, understand better what is happening uh, understand better what is happening uh, with the root causes. Uh, so you can see with the root causes. Uh, so you can see with the root causes. Uh, so you can see in that little what's that called the in that little what's that called the in that little what's that called the tree diagram, the the one with the tree diagram, the the one with the tree diagram, the the one with the little blocks, tree mapping, I've been little blocks, tree mapping, I've been little blocks, tree mapping, I've been informed. Uh, and so it we see the uh, informed. Uh, and so it we see the uh, informed. Uh, and so it we see the uh, the largest block there over this period the largest block there over this period the largest block there over this period of time, which goes back to December 22, of time, which goes back to December 22, of time, which goes back to December 22, is C.WE79. W79. Who can tell me what is C.WE79. W79. Who can tell me what is C.WE79. W79. Who can tell me what that one that one that one is? Cross- sight scripting. Very good. is? Cross- sight scripting. Very good. is? Cross- sight scripting. Very good. Very good. Let me check with the judges. Very good. Let me check with the judges. Very good. Let me check with the judges. Is that is that Is that is that Is that is that correct? That's what's in the correct? That's what's in the correct? That's what's in the parenthetical of the entry. That's it's parenthetical of the entry. That's it's parenthetical of the entry. That's it's the parenthetical. That's right. Little the parenthetical. That's right. Little the parenthetical.

I mean, this is a Improper neutral. I mean, this is a really valuable point. I mean, I don't really valuable point. I mean, I don't really valuable point. I mean, I don't want to derail what we're doing. No want to derail what we're doing. No want to derail what we're doing. No derail. But I know that a lot of people derail. But I know that a lot of people derail. But I know that a lot of people uh wonder oh uh wonder about uh the the uh wonder oh uh wonder about uh the the uh wonder oh uh wonder about uh the the arcane language that is in within C.WE. arcane language that is in within C.WE. arcane language that is in within C.WE. In fact, just a quick plug. Uh Mr. Steve In fact, just a quick plug. Uh Mr. Steve In fact, just a quick plug. Uh Mr. Steve Christy Kohley is presenting later today Christy Kohley is presenting later today Christy Kohley is presenting later today about C.WE. So you should all go if you about C.WE. So you should all go if you about C.WE. So you should all go if you can. I not I don't know what else is can. I not I don't know what else is can. I not I don't know what else is competing with that talk, but just so competing with that talk, but just so competing with that talk, but just so you're aware. Um but I'll just make this you're aware. Um but I'll just make this you're aware. Um but I'll just make this very quick point, which is that language very quick point, which is that language very quick point, which is that language in CWE is unique and it's very in CWE is unique and it's very in CWE is unique and it's very intentional. it's not commonly intentional. it's not commonly intentional. it's not commonly understood and there's a a common understood and there's a a common understood and there's a a common uh frustration I think from the uh frustration I think from the uh frustration I think from the community around it to to use it. Um and community around it to to use it. Um and community around it to to use it. Um and that's because it's written from a that's because it's written from a that's because it's written from a weakness uh perspective defined within a weakness uh perspective defined within a weakness uh perspective defined within a vulnerability theory document that goes vulnerability theory document that goes vulnerability theory document that goes way back. Um when we try and define way back. Um when we try and define way back. Um when we try and define things like behavior, what does behavior things like behavior, what does behavior things like behavior, what does behavior mean and what is the intended um um mean and what is the intended um um mean and what is the intended um um behavior and what is the problem? What behavior and what is the problem? What behavior and what is the problem? What is the mistake associated with it? So is the mistake associated with it? So is the mistake associated with it? So when you think about cross-ite when you think about cross-ite when you think about cross-ite scripting, the actual uh term cross-ite scripting, the actual uh term cross-ite scripting, the actual uh term cross-ite scripting in and of itself is the attack scripting in and of itself is the attack scripting in and of itself is the attack that you are uh performing against a that you are uh performing against a that you are uh performing against a weakness. And the weakness really is weakness. And the weakness really is weakness. And the weakness really is about improper neutralization about improper neutralization about improper neutralization uh of special elements. And so uh that's uh of special elements. And so uh that's uh of special elements. And so uh that's yeah just a quick plug on that but this yeah just a quick plug on that but this yeah just a quick plug on that but this is a great opportunity. It's a great is a great opportunity. It's a great is a great opportunity. It's a great it's a great opportunity. So let me it's a great opportunity. So let me it's a great opportunity. So let me translate this into Bob speak. So there translate this into Bob speak. So there translate this into Bob speak. So there are four V's, four words that start with are four V's, four words that start with are four V's, four words that start with the letter V that we think a lot about. the letter V that we think a lot about. the letter V that we think a lot about. So the first is as we think about how So the first is as we think about how So the first is as we think about how things play out in the news, what we things play out in the news, what we things play out in the news, what we find is that the news often celebrates find is that the news often celebrates find is that the news often celebrates the villains and the things that the the villains and the things that the the villains and the things that the villains did well to overcome the villains did well to overcome the villains did well to overcome the controls and to to create havoc. And controls and to to create havoc. And controls and to to create havoc. And then we turn around and we shame the then we turn around and we shame the then we turn around and we shame the victims for not having patched fast victims for not having patched fast victims for not having patched fast enough, for not having intuited all of enough, for not having intuited all of enough, for not having intuited all of the things that a hardening guide would the things that a hardening guide would the things that a hardening guide would tell you you have to do. And what we're tell you you have to do. And what we're tell you you have to do. And what we're missing is the third word that starts missing is the third word that starts missing is the third word that starts with the letter V, which are the vendors with the letter V, which are the vendors with the letter V, which are the vendors who create the software that makes many who create the software that makes many who create the software that makes many of these attacks not just possible but of these attacks not just possible but of these attacks not just possible but inevitable. And then the fourth V is is inevitable. And then the fourth V is is inevitable. And then the fourth V is is the visionaries who are already building the visionaries who are already building the visionaries who are already building products that are close to secure by products that are close to secure by products that are close to secure by design. And so there are things that we design. And so there are things that we design. And so there are things that we can we can learn from them. So as I as I can we can learn from them. So as I as I can we can learn from them. So as I as I think about this the word the words think about this the word the words think about this the word the words cross- sight scripting are the things cross- sight scripting are the things cross- sight scripting are the things that the villains do. They are scripting that the villains do. They are scripting that the villains do. They are scripting across sites and so that's what they do. across sites and so that's what they do. across sites and so that's what they do. It's a the attacker centric one. How do It's a the attacker centric one. How do It's a the attacker centric one. How do we start talking about things in terms we start talking about things in terms we start talking about things in terms of the uh the coding errors that of the uh the coding errors that of the uh the coding errors that occurred within the product those occurred within the product those occurred within the product those recurring classes of defect so that we recurring classes of defect so that we recurring classes of defect so that we can start to learn what are the patterns can start to learn what are the patterns can start to learn what are the patterns how do we start to do things. education how do we start to do things. education how do we start to do things. education is not going to solve all the problems. is not going to solve all the problems. is not going to solve all the problems. Sometimes frameworks are the the way Sometimes frameworks are the the way Sometimes frameworks are the the way that you do it. You don't actually just that you do it. You don't actually just that you do it. You don't actually just go yell at the developers. That's just go yell at the developers. That's just go yell at the developers. That's just not a strategy. So anyway, so we have CW not a strategy. So anyway, so we have CW not a strategy. So anyway, so we have CW uh uh 79. So that's one of those uh uh 79. So that's one of those uh uh 79. So that's one of those unforgivable vulnerabilities uh that was unforgivable vulnerabilities uh that was unforgivable vulnerabilities uh that was that was in that 2007 paper. Um over to that was in that 2007 paper. Um over to that was in that 2007 paper. Um over to the right we've got um the let's see the right we've got um the let's see the right we've got um the let's see these are the CWES totals. Boy, this is these are the CWES totals. Boy, this is these are the CWES totals. Boy, this is really small. Let me come over really small. Let me come over really small. Let me come over here. Yeah. So this is just the average here. Yeah. So this is just the average here. Yeah. So this is just the average uh uh between those that do and and do uh uh between those that do and and do uh uh between those that do and and do not. And so it's just it's just another not. And so it's just it's just another not. And so it's just it's just another representation of the same kind of thing representation of the same kind of thing representation of the same kind of thing showing progress. Um Alec, what other showing progress. Um Alec, what other showing progress. Um Alec, what other things did you want to add or Sure. So things did you want to add or Sure. So things did you want to add or Sure. So yeah, just in short, I think uh Sandy yeah, just in short, I think uh Sandy yeah, just in short, I think uh Sandy made the point earlier that we are made the point earlier that we are made the point earlier that we are looking at these things closer. I think looking at these things closer. I think looking at these things closer. I think I think this is true for sort of the I think this is true for sort of the I think this is true for sort of the landscape perspective which this is landscape perspective which this is landscape perspective which this is providing right you can from from the providing right you can from from the providing right you can from from the landscape perspective recognize you know landscape perspective recognize you know landscape perspective recognize you know certain trends around you know the data certain trends around you know the data certain trends around you know the data and how you might want to respond and and how you might want to respond and and how you might want to respond and and this is sort of one of the and this is sort of one of the and this is sort of one of the underlying thesis of root cause underlying thesis of root cause underlying thesis of root cause mapping's value is that you are able to mapping's value is that you are able to mapping's value is that you are able to see these kinds of things and and maybe see these kinds of things and and maybe see these kinds of things and and maybe respond in the right kind of way of respond in the right kind of way of respond in the right kind of way of understanding around priorities and and understanding around priorities and and understanding around priorities and and sort of policies internally and and sort of policies internally and and sort of policies internally and and funding and and and all these kinds of funding and and and all these kinds of funding and and and all these kinds of things this important feedback loop things this important feedback loop things this important feedback loop within in your uh software development within in your uh software development within in your uh software development life cycle or your hardware design um life cycle or your hardware design um life cycle or your hardware design um processes. Um and as I say, maybe I processes. Um and as I say, maybe I processes. Um and as I say, maybe I should be a little bit more clear in should be a little bit more clear in should be a little bit more clear in addition to this sort of broader addition to this sort of broader addition to this sort of broader landscape approach, this applies at the landscape approach, this applies at the landscape approach, this applies at the individual uh organizational level. And individual uh organizational level. And individual uh organizational level. And so these are things that are really so these are things that are really so these are things that are really valuable and looking at this data closer valuable and looking at this data closer valuable and looking at this data closer is is is a good thing. um just looking is is is a good thing. um just looking is is is a good thing. um just looking at the trend and we say well you know at the trend and we say well you know at the trend and we say well you know the the CVE program initiative um the the the CVE program initiative um the the the CVE program initiative um the enrichment initiative and and and some enrichment initiative and and and some enrichment initiative and and and some of these things that I talked about of these things that I talked about of these things that I talked about earlier and some other folks have talked earlier and some other folks have talked earlier and some other folks have talked about with respect to the enrichment about with respect to the enrichment about with respect to the enrichment recognition list and and these kinds of recognition list and and these kinds of recognition list and and these kinds of things um we say well look there's things um we say well look there's things um we say well look there's people providing CWES even before that people providing CWES even before that people providing CWES even before that started and that's true and part of that started and that's true and part of that started and that's true and part of that is because of the uh capability within is because of the uh capability within is because of the uh capability within the ecosystem for CVE record uh the ecosystem for CVE record uh the ecosystem for CVE record uh generating clients you know many in this generating clients you know many in this generating clients you know many in this room might be familiar with with room might be familiar with with room might be familiar with with vulneroggram and And when the CVE record vulneroggram and And when the CVE record vulneroggram and And when the CVE record uh created or or transitioned sort of uh created or or transitioned sort of uh created or or transitioned sort of into a more structured model where these into a more structured model where these into a more structured model where these things were able to be provided, people things were able to be provided, people things were able to be provided, people started doing it right. And and I think started doing it right. And and I think started doing it right. And and I think that's one of the key points um my that's one of the key points um my that's one of the key points um my co-presenter Chris Madden made which I co-presenter Chris Madden made which I co-presenter Chris Madden made which I thought was so poignant um earlier this thought was so poignant um earlier this thought was so poignant um earlier this week is that when you make things easier week is that when you make things easier week is that when you make things easier uh for people, they will do it right. uh for people, they will do it right. uh for people, they will do it right. The best is not to try and just educate The best is not to try and just educate The best is not to try and just educate and and browbead and say do this thing. and and browbead and say do this thing. and and browbead and say do this thing. It's making it easier for them to do it. It's making it easier for them to do it. It's making it easier for them to do it. Um and so that's one example of that. Um and so that's one example of that. Um and so that's one example of that. Um, and when we think about the Um, and when we think about the Um, and when we think about the challenge of root cause mapping, there's challenge of root cause mapping, there's challenge of root cause mapping, there's also ways that we can start to leverage also ways that we can start to leverage also ways that we can start to leverage new technology advancements to try and new technology advancements to try and new technology advancements to try and help people do that in addition to help people do that in addition to help people do that in addition to learning how to do it. Um, helping them learning how to do it. Um, helping them learning how to do it. Um, helping them learn how to do it easier is really the learn how to do it easier is really the learn how to do it easier is really the goal. So, that's all I'll add. Yeah, goal. So, that's all I'll add. Yeah, goal. So, that's all I'll add. Yeah, this was really a a testament to all of this was really a a testament to all of this was really a a testament to all of the folks in the room that are the folks in the room that are the folks in the room that are contributing where we saw that trend contributing where we saw that trend contributing where we saw that trend line go up so high. It's continuing to line go up so high. It's continuing to line go up so high. It's continuing to to to raise. um the trend line is is to to raise. um the trend line is is to to raise. um the trend line is is going up as we're making progress um going up as we're making progress um going up as we're making progress um with you all uh contributing. Um so with you all uh contributing. Um so with you all uh contributing. Um so we're just really, you know, glad we we we're just really, you know, glad we we we're just really, you know, glad we we set that goal last year um after last set that goal last year um after last set that goal last year um after last year's Volcon um and really work that year's Volcon um and really work that year's Volcon um and really work that through the CVE program with all the through the CVE program with all the through the CVE program with all the CNAs and um and we're still doing, you CNAs and um and we're still doing, you CNAs and um and we're still doing, you know, targeted outreach as well to um know, targeted outreach as well to um know, targeted outreach as well to um you know, help with training, help with you know, help with training, help with you know, help with training, help with um you know, getting more CNAs on as we um you know, getting more CNAs on as we um you know, getting more CNAs on as we were talking about earlier. So this can were talking about earlier. So this can were talking about earlier. So this can continue to grow. This trend line can continue to grow. This trend line can continue to grow. This trend line can continue to grow. Um I think we we kind continue to grow. Um I think we we kind continue to grow. Um I think we we kind of hit it on completeness. We've got of hit it on completeness. We've got of hit it on completeness. We've got like eight eight or nine minutes left. like eight eight or nine minutes left. like eight eight or nine minutes left. Um we really wanted to end on improving Um we really wanted to end on improving Um we really wanted to end on improving quality thoughts on improving quality. I quality thoughts on improving quality. I quality thoughts on improving quality. I think the last slide is really just um think the last slide is really just um think the last slide is really just um getting to um you know our our talking getting to um you know our our talking getting to um you know our our talking points and then getting the the points and then getting the the points and then getting the the audience's feedback on quality. Um, so audience's feedback on quality. Um, so audience's feedback on quality. Um, so Alec and Bob, uh, Ben, um, before before Alec and Bob, uh, Ben, um, before before Alec and Bob, uh, Ben, um, before before we move off of that that last point and we move off of that that last point and we move off of that that last point and we go into quality, I wanted to get we go into quality, I wanted to get we go into quality, I wanted to get Ben's, um, input on the Northstar. What Ben's, um, input on the Northstar. What Ben's, um, input on the Northstar. What what's your what's you're you're a what's your what's you're you're a what's your what's you're you're a partner of ours, uh, part of the CVE partner of ours, uh, part of the CVE partner of ours, uh, part of the CVE community. Um, from your community. Um, from your community. Um, from your perspective, is this going in the right perspective, is this going in the right perspective, is this going in the right direction? Would you give us any input direction? Would you give us any input direction? Would you give us any input from your perspective, uh, in from the from your perspective, uh, in from the from your perspective, uh, in from the vendor community? Right. So I think as I vendor community? Right. So I think as I vendor community? Right. So I think as I said in the during the first question said in the during the first question said in the during the first question you asked the ability to communicate is you asked the ability to communicate is you asked the ability to communicate is the first thing. So we have that the first thing. So we have that the first thing. So we have that completeness and that's what we want and completeness and that's what we want and completeness and that's what we want and from the vendor community that's super from the vendor community that's super from the vendor community that's super important to us. Um and so as we on we important to us. Um and so as we on we important to us. Um and so as we on we see more software out there we need that see more software out there we need that see more software out there we need that communication ability. That is the first communication ability. That is the first communication ability. That is the first step. The completeness is being able to step. The completeness is being able to step. The completeness is being able to uh you know look at these things, ingest uh you know look at these things, ingest uh you know look at these things, ingest it in a um reasonable way, have that be it in a um reasonable way, have that be it in a um reasonable way, have that be consistent as well as complete. Um and consistent as well as complete. Um and consistent as well as complete. Um and again communicate, it allows us to again communicate, it allows us to again communicate, it allows us to communicate more information. And then communicate more information. And then communicate more information. And then if we can trust that information if we can trust that information if we can trust that information throughout the quality, those three throughout the quality, those three throughout the quality, those three things are are really things are are really things are are really great. Also, what Bob's efforts with great. Also, what Bob's efforts with great. Also, what Bob's efforts with secure by design are gonna help our secure by design are gonna help our secure by design are gonna help our everybody. It helps everybody. I mean, everybody. It helps everybody. I mean, everybody. It helps everybody. I mean, I'm going to say our customers, but you I'm going to say our customers, but you I'm going to say our customers, but you know, everybody have more secure know, everybody have more secure know, everybody have more secure software. Um, and we're going to have software. Um, and we're going to have software. Um, and we're going to have this red queen where we're going to fix this red queen where we're going to fix this red queen where we're going to fix cross- sight scripting. We can do it. We cross- sight scripting. We can do it. We cross- sight scripting. We can do it. We can we can fix buffer overflows. can we can fix buffer overflows. can we can fix buffer overflows. Everybody just has to write everything Everybody just has to write everything Everybody just has to write everything in Rust from now on. Um, but there's in Rust from now on. Um, but there's in Rust from now on. Um, but there's going to be new attacks. We worked on a going to be new attacks. We worked on a going to be new attacks. We worked on a C.WE for AI systems, right? and we have C.WE for AI systems, right? and we have C.WE for AI systems, right? and we have new technologies that come out that are new technologies that come out that are new technologies that come out that are going to have clever attacks against going to have clever attacks against going to have clever attacks against them. Um, so we need to be able to have them. Um, so we need to be able to have them. Um, so we need to be able to have the quality, have the communication to the quality, have the communication to the quality, have the communication to address all of those things from both address all of those things from both address all of those things from both ends, from the the root causes all the ends, from the the root causes all the ends, from the the root causes all the way to the reactions. And I think that I way to the reactions. And I think that I way to the reactions. And I think that I I appreciate SIZA giving this panel and I appreciate SIZA giving this panel and I appreciate SIZA giving this panel and bringing us all together to say, hey, I bringing us all together to say, hey, I bringing us all together to say, hey, I think we're doing a good job. actually think we're doing a good job. actually think we're doing a good job. actually um at this conference I've heard lots of um at this conference I've heard lots of um at this conference I've heard lots of talks about quality. I've heard lots of talks about quality. I've heard lots of talks about quality. I've heard lots of talks about uh kind of issues of putting talks about uh kind of issues of putting talks about uh kind of issues of putting things together. Um lots of talks about things together. Um lots of talks about things together. Um lots of talks about leveraging the data that we have and leveraging the data that we have and leveraging the data that we have and honestly I am grateful that it's there. honestly I am grateful that it's there. honestly I am grateful that it's there. Right? So I am grateful for for all the Right? So I am grateful for for all the Right? So I am grateful for for all the free free resources that we have that we free free resources that we have that we free free resources that we have that we can leverage for this data. I am can leverage for this data. I am can leverage for this data. I am grateful for this community who can grateful for this community who can grateful for this community who can bring these ideas together who can point bring these ideas together who can point bring these ideas together who can point out flaws and work towards solutions. out flaws and work towards solutions. out flaws and work towards solutions. um and and do that in a constructive um and and do that in a constructive um and and do that in a constructive communitydriven way. Um and so as SIZ's communitydriven way. Um and so as SIZ's communitydriven way. Um and so as SIZ's north star is guiding this, I think they north star is guiding this, I think they north star is guiding this, I think they are right on track to kind of the the are right on track to kind of the the are right on track to kind of the the zeitgeist of the conference, right? zeitgeist of the conference, right? zeitgeist of the conference, right? Everybody's talking about quality. Everybody's talking about quality. Everybody's talking about quality. Everybody's talking about being able to Everybody's talking about being able to Everybody's talking about being able to action better on on vulnerability data. action better on on vulnerability data. action better on on vulnerability data. Um and you know, that's exactly where Um and you know, that's exactly where Um and you know, that's exactly where where SIS is going. where SIS is going. where SIS is going. Alec or Bob, was was there anything we Alec or Bob, was was there anything we Alec or Bob, was was there anything we could do upfront with uh the community could do upfront with uh the community could do upfront with uh the community to kind of raise the bar, help them to to kind of raise the bar, help them to to kind of raise the bar, help them to raise to raise the bar? Um any programs raise to raise the bar? Um any programs raise to raise the bar? Um any programs that you are are working on in um or can that you are are working on in um or can that you are are working on in um or can contribute from a CVE or MITER contribute from a CVE or MITER contribute from a CVE or MITER standpoint? So I will say that you know obviously So I will say that you know obviously So I will say that you know obviously the title of the panel and and and I the title of the panel and and and I the title of the panel and and and I can't speak on behalf of CISA but I do can't speak on behalf of CISA but I do can't speak on behalf of CISA but I do recognize the shared goals that a lot recognize the shared goals that a lot recognize the shared goals that a lot you know Ben you're saying that that as you know Ben you're saying that that as you know Ben you're saying that that as evidenced by the talks that we have as evidenced by the talks that we have as evidenced by the talks that we have as an ecosystem and a partner and CIS is a an ecosystem and a partner and CIS is a an ecosystem and a partner and CIS is a key partner in all this uh as part of key partner in all this uh as part of key partner in all this uh as part of this program um CNAs are really driving this program um CNAs are really driving this program um CNAs are really driving a lot of what we want to do right and a lot of what we want to do right and a lot of what we want to do right and and um and I think that's True. And and and um and I think that's True. And and and um and I think that's True. And and I think the other thing and just you I think the other thing and just you I think the other thing and just you know speaking to what's on the screen know speaking to what's on the screen know speaking to what's on the screen too I think what's really important is too I think what's really important is too I think what's really important is for this community and for the broader for this community and for the broader for this community and for the broader community to share the feedback. Uh I community to share the feedback. Uh I community to share the feedback. Uh I think it's fair to say again not think it's fair to say again not think it's fair to say again not speaking for SISA but I think to hear speaking for SISA but I think to hear speaking for SISA but I think to hear from the community how SISA can help uh from the community how SISA can help uh from the community how SISA can help uh the community and how um also the CVE the community and how um also the CVE the community and how um also the CVE program. Again, plugging the uh QR code program. Again, plugging the uh QR code program. Again, plugging the uh QR code here. That survey is open. Um it has here. That survey is open. Um it has here. That survey is open. Um it has been open for like a month or so and been open for like a month or so and been open for like a month or so and then it stopped and and now it's open then it stopped and and now it's open then it stopped and and now it's open again for Voncon. Uh and we're going to again for Voncon. Uh and we're going to again for Voncon. Uh and we're going to keep it open over the weekend. Please do keep it open over the weekend. Please do keep it open over the weekend. Please do feed fill it out. Um because we intend feed fill it out. Um because we intend feed fill it out. Um because we intend to sort of use that and and be very to sort of use that and and be very to sort of use that and and be very public about sort of what we see in the public about sort of what we see in the public about sort of what we see in the survey responses and and share it and survey responses and and share it and survey responses and and share it and sort of talk about these solutions. sort of talk about these solutions. sort of talk about these solutions. trusts in in I will say I've been so trusts in in I will say I've been so trusts in in I will say I've been so pleasantly surprised in the considered pleasantly surprised in the considered pleasantly surprised in the considered inputs from people um that have done it inputs from people um that have done it inputs from people um that have done it so far. So thank you if you have um it's so far. So thank you if you have um it's so far. So thank you if you have um it's really valuable to see people you know really valuable to see people you know really valuable to see people you know taking the time to provide valuable taking the time to provide valuable taking the time to provide valuable input um so thank you and if you haven't input um so thank you and if you haven't input um so thank you and if you haven't uh please do yeah just plus one to all uh please do yeah just plus one to all uh please do yeah just plus one to all of that. The only thing I I I would add of that. The only thing I I I would add of that. The only thing I I I would add is uh I'm trying to personally think a is uh I'm trying to personally think a is uh I'm trying to personally think a lot more about the downstream customers lot more about the downstream customers lot more about the downstream customers and the consumers of uh the CVE program. and the consumers of uh the CVE program. and the consumers of uh the CVE program. That's many of you. And so uh if you That's many of you. And so uh if you That's many of you. And so uh if you wanted to talk more, you know, feel free wanted to talk more, you know, feel free wanted to talk more, you know, feel free to reach out. I think uh when I think to reach out. I think uh when I think to reach out. I think uh when I think about what really good product managers about what really good product managers about what really good product managers do, they become obsessive about learning do, they become obsessive about learning do, they become obsessive about learning from the customers about what is from the customers about what is from the customers about what is actually happening in the field. And so actually happening in the field. And so actually happening in the field. And so I'm going to try to channel some of that I'm going to try to channel some of that I'm going to try to channel some of that energy personally and hoping to uh to energy personally and hoping to uh to energy personally and hoping to uh to inspire others to do the same. Over to inspire others to do the same. Over to inspire others to do the same. Over to you Sandy. you Sandy. you Sandy. Yeah, that that really closes us out. I Yeah, that that really closes us out. I Yeah, that that really closes us out. I know um we're we're doing our best here know um we're we're doing our best here know um we're we're doing our best here to work across the community and uh to work across the community and uh to work across the community and uh would love to get your feedback um on would love to get your feedback um on would love to get your feedback um on this talk. Uh any input you have to help this talk. Uh any input you have to help this talk. Uh any input you have to help us get to um a higher level of quality us get to um a higher level of quality us get to um a higher level of quality and completeness. Um and uh just thanks and completeness. Um and uh just thanks and completeness. Um and uh just thanks for having us. I think uh we've got a for having us. I think uh we've got a for having us. I think uh we've got a couple minutes left. If anyone wants to couple minutes left. If anyone wants to couple minutes left. If anyone wants to ask a question, um we're happy to take ask a question, um we're happy to take ask a question, um we're happy to take those.
