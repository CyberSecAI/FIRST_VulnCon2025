Uh, the talk is going to be about the Uh, the talk is going to be about the Uh, the talk is going to be about the Cisco experience. I needed to put a Cisco experience. I needed to put a Cisco experience. I needed to put a little bit of a haha joke in there. little bit of a haha joke in there. little bit of a haha joke in there. Okay. At Cisco, um, my name is Dario Okay. At Cisco, um, my name is Dario Okay. At Cisco, um, my name is Dario Sicaron and I am a principal engineer Sicaron and I am a principal engineer Sicaron and I am a principal engineer with the security and trust organization with the security and trust organization with the security and trust organization at at at Cisco. Uh, maybe this works or maybe it Cisco. Uh, maybe this works or maybe it Cisco. Uh, maybe this works or maybe it doesn't. I have to put okay who am I and doesn't. I have to put okay who am I and doesn't. I have to put okay who am I and this is who I am everybody here can this is who I am everybody here can this is who I am everybody here can read. So uh currently I'm with the um read. So uh currently I'm with the um read. So uh currently I'm with the um Cisco secure development secure life Cisco secure development secure life Cisco secure development secure life cycle development organization. I used cycle development organization. I used cycle development organization. I used to be with the product security in to be with the product security in to be with the product security in response team. I was there for 20 years response team. I was there for 20 years response team. I was there for 20 years and I saw so many things that you know and I saw so many things that you know and I saw so many things that you know it scared me. It it changed me forever. it scared me. It it changed me forever. it scared me. It it changed me forever. Um before that I was on the war with Um before that I was on the war with Um before that I was on the war with security practices. We were doing pent security practices. We were doing pent security practices. We were doing pent testing okay like white hat hacking or testing okay like white hat hacking or testing okay like white hat hacking or whatever you know it was called back in whatever you know it was called back in whatever you know it was called back in the day. We were doing solutions the day. We were doing solutions the day. We were doing solutions security solutions design and security solutions design and security solutions design and implementation. Before that work for the implementation. Before that work for the implementation. Before that work for the government and this should give you an government and this should give you an government and this should give you an idea how old I am. Okay. I was managing idea how old I am. Okay. I was managing idea how old I am. Okay. I was managing a network that was Nobel 311 servers and a network that was Nobel 311 servers and a network that was Nobel 311 servers and network 351 and SEO Unix 3. We have all network 351 and SEO Unix 3. We have all network 351 and SEO Unix 3. We have all of that. Okay. to keep it fun. We had of that. Okay. to keep it fun. We had of that. Okay. to keep it fun. We had one in on each on each one of those. Um, one in on each on each one of those. Um, one in on each on each one of those. Um, and by the way, as a and by the way, as a and by the way, as a side, I remember the servers running side, I remember the servers running side, I remember the servers running Noel Netware 311. They were like this Noel Netware 311. They were like this Noel Netware 311. They were like this big. I talked to my kids. They were like big. I talked to my kids. They were like big. I talked to my kids. They were like this big and this big and this big and this big and this big and this big and this big and this big and this big and we had 4 gigabytes of storage and we we had 4 gigabytes of storage and we we had 4 gigabytes of storage and we were king of the war. Okay. And then I were king of the war. Okay. And then I were king of the war. Okay. And then I tell my daughter, the phone that you tell my daughter, the phone that you tell my daughter, the phone that you have on your pocket probably has more have on your pocket probably has more have on your pocket probably has more computer power that all servers computer power that all servers computer power that all servers together. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Come on. together. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Come on. together. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Come on. Back to take you to the you know to the Back to take you to the you know to the Back to take you to the you know to the house and but yeah house and but yeah house and but yeah um before that university learning to um before that university learning to um before that university learning to program to Pascal and in high school I program to Pascal and in high school I program to Pascal and in high school I was disassembling computer viruses back was disassembling computer viruses back was disassembling computer viruses back in the day. I don't know you know don't in the day. I don't know you know don't in the day. I don't know you know don't say that you remember this because then say that you remember this because then say that you remember this because then you are betraying yourself telling how you are betraying yourself telling how you are betraying yourself telling how old you are too. Um disassembling old you are too. Um disassembling old you are too. Um disassembling viruses like Jerusalem viruses like Jerusalem viruses like Jerusalem M1808 using the good old DOS debug M1808 using the good old DOS debug M1808 using the good old DOS debug utility from the command line. That was utility from the command line. That was utility from the command line. That was fun. fun. fun. Now let's talk about distributing Now let's talk about distributing Now let's talk about distributing vulnerability information at Cisco. Uh vulnerability information at Cisco. Uh vulnerability information at Cisco. Uh because of who we are, we don't actually because of who we are, we don't actually because of who we are, we don't actually have one mechanism. We have more than have one mechanism. We have more than have one mechanism. We have more than five. Okay? And we're going to go super five. Okay? And we're going to go super five. Okay? And we're going to go super quickly through this. Don't worry, I'm quickly through this. Don't worry, I'm quickly through this. Don't worry, I'm not going to spend a lot of time. This not going to spend a lot of time. This not going to spend a lot of time. This just for you to familiarize yourself just for you to familiarize yourself just for you to familiarize yourself with the different mechanism that we with the different mechanism that we with the different mechanism that we have. We have the traditional Cisco have. We have the traditional Cisco have. We have the traditional Cisco advisories which come in two different advisories which come in two different advisories which come in two different flavors which come HTML anybody can read flavors which come HTML anybody can read flavors which come HTML anybody can read or um CESAF so they are machine or um CESAF so they are machine or um CESAF so they are machine readable. We have the open bone API we readable. We have the open bone API we readable. We have the open bone API we have um software checker and debug have um software checker and debug have um software checker and debug search toolkit and give you a quick search toolkit and give you a quick search toolkit and give you a quick example of each one of those. This is a example of each one of those. This is a example of each one of those. This is a traditional Cisco security advisory as I traditional Cisco security advisory as I traditional Cisco security advisory as I said before is in HTML. This is supposed said before is in HTML. This is supposed said before is in HTML. This is supposed to be consumed by to be consumed by to be consumed by humans and right there from the advisory humans and right there from the advisory humans and right there from the advisory itself and and and you have you know the itself and and and you have you know the itself and and and you have you know the title summary details affected version title summary details affected version title summary details affected version CV ID bug ids etc etc etc we're not CV ID bug ids etc etc etc we're not CV ID bug ids etc etc etc we're not going to spend a lot of time talking going to spend a lot of time talking going to spend a lot of time talking about that you can click from there and about that you can click from there and about that you can click from there and you can download the CISF version of you can download the CISF version of you can download the CISF version of this advisor so you can import into your this advisor so you can import into your this advisor so you can import into your into your tool um the thing here is that into your tool um the thing here is that into your tool um the thing here is that this is us this is Cisco telling you this is us this is Cisco telling you this is us this is Cisco telling you about a vulnerability Okay, I want for about a vulnerability Okay, I want for about a vulnerability Okay, I want for you to be aware of this vulnerability, you to be aware of this vulnerability, you to be aware of this vulnerability, this CBD, these symptoms, these this CBD, these symptoms, these this CBD, these symptoms, these workarounds, etc., etc., etc. And the workarounds, etc., etc., etc. And the workarounds, etc., etc., etc. And the vast majority of the advisories that vast majority of the advisories that vast majority of the advisories that Cisco publishes is for Cisco own Cisco publishes is for Cisco own Cisco publishes is for Cisco own vulnerabilities, okay? Or own vulnerabilities, okay? Or own vulnerabilities, okay? Or own vulnerabilities. We rarely, but we do it vulnerabilities. We rarely, but we do it vulnerabilities. We rarely, but we do it publish advisories for vulnerabilities publish advisories for vulnerabilities publish advisories for vulnerabilities in third-party software. Okay? So in third-party software. Okay? So in third-party software. Okay? So remember here rarely about third party remember here rarely about third party remember here rarely about third party software and we are telling you about software and we are telling you about software and we are telling you about this vulnerability. You are not asking this vulnerability. You are not asking this vulnerability. You are not asking us about the us about the us about the vulnerability. The next flavor is vulnerability. The next flavor is vulnerability. The next flavor is exactly the same thing and it's truly exactly the same thing and it's truly exactly the same thing and it's truly exactly the same thing because we take exactly the same thing because we take exactly the same thing because we take the same input data and goes down one the same input data and goes down one the same input data and goes down one pipe to become HTML and goes down a pipe to become HTML and goes down a pipe to become HTML and goes down a different pipe to become CESAF. And different pipe to become CESAF. And different pipe to become CESAF. And again exactly the same thing that we again exactly the same thing that we again exactly the same thing that we said before it's us about telling your said before it's us about telling your said before it's us about telling your vulnerability mostly about Cisco vulnerability mostly about Cisco vulnerability mostly about Cisco products most in in in the vast majority products most in in in the vast majority products most in in in the vast majority of advisories not about third party of advisories not about third party of advisories not about third party software and u that's about the size of software and u that's about the size of software and u that's about the size of it the open ball API a third it the open ball API a third it the open ball API a third mechanism integrates with other tool mechanism integrates with other tool mechanism integrates with other tool that we have is a software checker you that we have is a software checker you that we have is a software checker you can come you can query this API using a can come you can query this API using a can come you can query this API using a CB ID using advisory ID using a product CB ID using advisory ID using a product CB ID using advisory ID using a product identifier and it's going to give you identifier and it's going to give you identifier and it's going to give you information about Cisco SA, Cisco OS, information about Cisco SA, Cisco OS, information about Cisco SA, Cisco OS, Cisco USXE, but then again is Cisco USXE, but then again is Cisco USXE, but then again is exclusively about Cisco exclusively about Cisco exclusively about Cisco vulnerabilities. Oh, by the way, uh the vulnerabilities. Oh, by the way, uh the vulnerabilities. Oh, by the way, uh the API is free. Okay, the advisories are API is free. Okay, the advisories are API is free. Okay, the advisories are also free in case somebody was also free in case somebody was also free in case somebody was wondering. Cisco for checker. You come wondering. Cisco for checker. You come wondering. Cisco for checker. You come here again limited to non-TPS here again limited to non-TPS here again limited to non-TPS vulnerabilities and limited to a subset vulnerabilities and limited to a subset vulnerabilities and limited to a subset of products as it says there ASA of products as it says there ASA of products as it says there ASA firewall management center FTD FXOS etc firewall management center FTD FXOS etc firewall management center FTD FXOS etc etc etc. You enter a version number and etc etc. You enter a version number and etc etc. You enter a version number and the version and the product and and the the version and the product and and the the version and the product and and the software tells you okay that version of software tells you okay that version of software tells you okay that version of software for that product is affected by software for that product is affected by software for that product is affected by this this this this and this this this this this and this this this this this and this vulnerability and if there is a fix it's vulnerability and if there is a fix it's vulnerability and if there is a fix it's going to tell you this is the software going to tell you this is the software going to tell you this is the software version on which you can find a fix for version on which you can find a fix for version on which you can find a fix for that vulnerability or for all that that vulnerability or for all that that vulnerability or for all that vulnerabilities limited number of of vulnerabilities limited number of of vulnerabilities limited number of of this is all about again about Cisco this is all about again about Cisco this is all about again about Cisco limited number of operating systems limited number of operating systems limited number of operating systems limited number of products not about EPS limited number of products not about EPS limited number of products not about EPS PS and the final one or so to speak the PS and the final one or so to speak the PS and the final one or so to speak the dand is the box search toolkit. The box dand is the box search toolkit. The box dand is the box search toolkit. The box search toolkit is a generic tool at search toolkit is a generic tool at search toolkit is a generic tool at Cisco and these are how customers they Cisco and these are how customers they Cisco and these are how customers they go to our website and they find go to our website and they find go to our website and they find information about any defect in our information about any defect in our information about any defect in our products. This is not about this is not products. This is not about this is not products. This is not about this is not only about security vulnerabilities. only about security vulnerabilities. only about security vulnerabilities. It's about any defect affecting any It's about any defect affecting any It's about any defect affecting any Cisco product. You enter the bug ID or Cisco product. You enter the bug ID or Cisco product. You enter the bug ID or the defect ID in back you get all this the defect ID in back you get all this the defect ID in back you get all this information. You get the symptoms, information. You get the symptoms, information. You get the symptoms, conditions, workarounds, etc., etc., conditions, workarounds, etc., etc., conditions, workarounds, etc., etc., etc. We also use this to distribute etc. We also use this to distribute etc. We also use this to distribute vulnerability information both for Cisco vulnerability information both for Cisco vulnerability information both for Cisco products for Cisco vulnerabilities. It's products for Cisco vulnerabilities. It's products for Cisco vulnerabilities. It's always for Cisco products um for Cisco always for Cisco products um for Cisco always for Cisco products um for Cisco vulnerabilities and also we use this to vulnerabilities and also we use this to vulnerabilities and also we use this to distribute information about distribute information about distribute information about vulnerabilities on Cisco products which vulnerabilities on Cisco products which vulnerabilities on Cisco products which the source root is a third-party the source root is a third-party the source root is a third-party software component. However, quering the software component. However, quering the software component. However, quering the bug search toolkit, it's it's a little bug search toolkit, it's it's a little bug search toolkit, it's it's a little bit cumbersome. Okay, you need to look bit cumbersome. Okay, you need to look bit cumbersome. Okay, you need to look for CBD. You have no cap, you have for CBD. You have no cap, you have for CBD. You have no cap, you have limited capability to filter down by limited capability to filter down by limited capability to filter down by product, platform, release, etc., etc., product, platform, release, etc., etc., product, platform, release, etc., etc., etc. So, what online here is that we etc. So, what online here is that we etc. So, what online here is that we have multiple mechanism and they are have multiple mechanism and they are have multiple mechanism and they are they have all served us well all these they have all served us well all these they have all served us well all these years and we hope that also have help years and we hope that also have help years and we hope that also have help our customers. However, there was our customers. However, there was our customers. However, there was nothing like what we have now because nothing like what we have now because nothing like what we have now because this is the one. This is the one ring to this is the one. This is the one ring to this is the one. This is the one ring to rule them rule them rule them all. CVR, the Cisco vulnerability all. CVR, the Cisco vulnerability all. CVR, the Cisco vulnerability repository. We put this into production repository. We put this into production repository. We put this into production in May of 2022. This is specifically in May of 2022. This is specifically in May of 2022. This is specifically about about about vulnerabilities in third-party software vulnerabilities in third-party software vulnerabilities in third-party software affecting Cisco products. Okay. So once affecting Cisco products. Okay. So once affecting Cisco products. Okay. So once again, again, again, vulnerabilities in any Cisco product for vulnerabilities in any Cisco product for vulnerabilities in any Cisco product for which the root cause is a third-party which the root cause is a third-party which the root cause is a third-party software component, OpenSSL, Open SSH, software component, OpenSSL, Open SSH, software component, OpenSSL, Open SSH, Apache, Tomcat, etc., etc., Apache, Tomcat, etc., etc., Apache, Tomcat, etc., etc., etc. If the customer enters a a Cisco CV etc. If the customer enters a a Cisco CV etc. If the customer enters a a Cisco CV ID or um or a TPS CV ID, as I said ID or um or a TPS CV ID, as I said ID or um or a TPS CV ID, as I said before, for very small number of third before, for very small number of third before, for very small number of third party software vulnerabilities, we do party software vulnerabilities, we do party software vulnerabilities, we do publish an advisory. If they enter that, publish an advisory. If they enter that, publish an advisory. If they enter that, they are going to be redirected to the they are going to be redirected to the they are going to be redirected to the actual advisory. They are not going to actual advisory. They are not going to actual advisory. They are not going to get an answer on the tool itself. Um, it get an answer on the tool itself. Um, it get an answer on the tool itself. Um, it only has information for TPS only has information for TPS only has information for TPS vulnerabilities that were disclosed vulnerabilities that were disclosed vulnerabilities that were disclosed started on 2018 and and after does not started on 2018 and and after does not started on 2018 and and after does not support cloud offerings. Allows the support cloud offerings. Allows the support cloud offerings. Allows the download of a beex document, a CISF download of a beex document, a CISF download of a beex document, a CISF document using the VEX profile. You document using the VEX profile. You document using the VEX profile. You select a given product, a given select a given product, a given select a given product, a given platform, a given release in a given CV platform, a given release in a given CV platform, a given release in a given CV ID and you're given the option to ID and you're given the option to ID and you're given the option to download a debex document for that. And download a debex document for that. And download a debex document for that. And we have an absolutely extensive FAQ at we have an absolutely extensive FAQ at we have an absolutely extensive FAQ at that URL which you are welcome to go and that URL which you are welcome to go and that URL which you are welcome to go and read. So quick screenshot for you to read. So quick screenshot for you to read. So quick screenshot for you to give you an idea. This is how it looks give you an idea.

E wow it works. Um, so this is what we will call a narrow query. what we will call a narrow query. what we will call a narrow query. Narrow. You enter a CV ID. Oops. You Narrow. You enter a CV ID. Oops. You Narrow. You enter a CV ID. Oops. You enter a CV ID here and then you select a enter a CV ID here and then you select a enter a CV ID here and then you select a product and then you select a platform product and then you select a platform product and then you select a platform and then you select a software release. and then you select a software release. and then you select a software release. Okay? Product, platform, and release. Okay? Product, platform, and release. Okay? Product, platform, and release. And then you get hopefully an And then you get hopefully an And then you get hopefully an answer. And this is what we call a broad answer. And this is what we call a broad answer. And this is what we call a broad query. The only thing that you enter query. The only thing that you enter query. The only thing that you enter here is a CV ID. And just press enter, here is a CV ID. And just press enter, here is a CV ID. And just press enter, you know, to the races. And when you get you know, to the races. And when you get you know, to the races. And when you get back is this list of all the Cisco back is this list of all the Cisco back is this list of all the Cisco products. And if you click on the plus, products. And if you click on the plus, products. And if you click on the plus, then they're going to expand to then they're going to expand to then they're going to expand to platforms. And then you click on the platforms. And then you click on the platforms. And then you click on the plus and it's going to expand to plus and it's going to expand to plus and it's going to expand to releases. And then you're going to have releases. And then you're going to have releases. And then you're going to have the actual determination. Okay? And then the actual determination. Okay? And then the actual determination. Okay? And then again, you can download the VEX again, you can download the VEX again, you can download the VEX document. This is an example of a document. This is an example of a document. This is an example of a vulnerability for which this specific vulnerability for which this specific vulnerability for which this specific release is not affected. Okay? is not release is not affected. Okay? is not release is not affected. Okay? is not affected. And right there is the link. affected. And right there is the link. affected. And right there is the link. If you click there, you're going to If you click there, you're going to If you click there, you're going to download this data as a vex download this data as a vex download this data as a vex document. And this is an example on document. And this is an example on document. And this is an example on which the this release for this platform which the this release for this platform which the this release for this platform of this product is actually affected. We of this product is actually affected. We of this product is actually affected. We put it in red in case that you know we put it in red in case that you know we put it in red in case that you know we really needed to make it obvious. And really needed to make it obvious. And really needed to make it obvious. And once again you can click here and once again you can click here and once again you can click here and download the VEX document. Now before download the VEX document. Now before download the VEX document. Now before somebody ask what happens when we don't somebody ask what happens when we don't somebody ask what happens when we don't know what happens when you come asking know what happens when you come asking know what happens when you come asking about hey does this vulnerability about hey does this vulnerability about hey does this vulnerability affects this release for this platform affects this release for this platform affects this release for this platform of this product then you get this okay of this product then you get this okay of this product then you get this okay you get this button that says request you get this button that says request you get this button that says request assessment and if you click on the assessment and if you click on the assessment and if you click on the button on the back end what is going to button on the back end what is going to button on the back end what is going to happen a ticket is going to be open and happen a ticket is going to be open and happen a ticket is going to be open and it's going to be sent to the product it's going to be sent to the product it's going to be sent to the product development team and basically it's development team and basically it's development team and basically it's going to say hey a customer wants to going to say hey a customer wants to going to say hey a customer wants to know if this software release is know if this software release is know if this software release is affected by this vulnerability, please affected by this vulnerability, please affected by this vulnerability, please tell us and then we turn around and we tell us and then we turn around and we tell us and then we turn around and we give that information to give that information to give that information to you. Any questions so you. Any questions so you. Any questions so far? Just how I like I don't see you. If you want. Thank you very much. So is this CVR Thank you very much. So is this CVR Thank you very much. So is this CVR behind any type of authorization? behind any type of authorization? behind any type of authorization? Excellent question. Excellent question. Excellent question. Excellent question. Excellent question. Excellent question. Yes, it is. Yes, it is. Yes, it is. However, However, However, however, you only need to sign up for a however, you only need to sign up for a however, you only need to sign up for a free guest account and you get access to free guest account and you get access to free guest account and you get access to all of these. So, no entitlement all of these. So, no entitlement all of these. So, no entitlement whatsoever. You don't have no whatsoever. You don't have no whatsoever. You don't have no entitlement whatsoever. It's not a payw entitlement whatsoever. It's not a payw entitlement whatsoever. It's not a payw wall. It is a requirement to be wall. It is a requirement to be wall. It is a requirement to be authenticated because once you're authenticated because once you're authenticated because once you're authenticated, we can do this. We can authenticated, we can do this. We can authenticated, we can do this. We can collect information. Okay? And hey, you collect information. Okay? And hey, you collect information. Okay? And hey, you know what? It's free. So, know what? It's free. So, know what? It's free. So, uh, CVR numbers. Okay. And we're going uh, CVR numbers. Okay. And we're going uh, CVR numbers. Okay. And we're going to split into, uh, queries and beex to split into, uh, queries and beex to split into, uh, queries and beex download this way. Yes. download this way. Yes. download this way. Yes. Okay. So, the sample data covers a Okay. So, the sample data covers a Okay. So, the sample data covers a little bit less than three years. Okay. little bit less than three years. Okay. little bit less than three years. Okay. A,00,040 days, which actually I use a A,00,040 days, which actually I use a A,00,040 days, which actually I use a tool to convert. It's two years and 10 tool to convert. It's two years and 10 tool to convert. It's two years and 10 months. uh we use or we had a total of months. uh we use or we had a total of months. uh we use or we had a total of 229,000 records. We eliminate 60,000 229,000 records. We eliminate 60,000 229,000 records. We eliminate 60,000 records of that sample set because they records of that sample set because they records of that sample set because they came from internal testing availability came from internal testing availability came from internal testing availability and performance tools in tools etc etc and performance tools in tools etc etc and performance tools in tools etc etc etc. I was looking I was like oh my etc. I was looking I was like oh my etc. I was looking I was like oh my goodness this person really really likes goodness this person really really likes goodness this person really really likes to come and quer application eh no it to come and quer application eh no it to come and quer application eh no it actually he was using he he should not actually he was using he he should not actually he was using he he should not be doing that he should be using a be doing that he should be using a be doing that he should be using a specific us testing account he was using specific us testing account he was using specific us testing account he was using his son account to perform the testing his son account to perform the testing his son account to perform the testing and there we are 60,000 that leaves us and there we are 60,000 that leaves us and there we are 60,000 that leaves us with with with approximately 170,000 valid records and approximately 170,000 valid records and approximately 170,000 valid records and from that we the first determination the from that we the first determination the from that we the first determination the first data point that we extract is that first data point that we extract is that first data point that we extract is that of all of the thousand of CBE IDs that of all of the thousand of CBE IDs that of all of the thousand of CBE IDs that have been issued since have been issued since have been issued since 1999, only 1999, only 1999, only 7700 have been queried to see if it 7700 have been queried to see if it 7700 have been queried to see if it affects Cisco product. And and please affects Cisco product. And and please affects Cisco product. And and please once again, let's remember that we are once again, let's remember that we are once again, let's remember that we are talking about CVE ids for third-party talking about CVE ids for third-party talking about CVE ids for third-party software component. Okay, your open software component. Okay, your open software component. Okay, your open SSLs, your open SSH, your Apache Tomcat, SSLs, your open SSH, your Apache Tomcat, SSLs, your open SSH, your Apache Tomcat, any open-source component. any open-source component. any open-source component. So customers have come to us asking for So customers have come to us asking for So customers have come to us asking for 7700 unique CV IDs and we have gotten 7700 unique CV IDs and we have gotten 7700 unique CV IDs and we have gotten requests from a little bit less than requests from a little bit less than requests from a little bit less than 13,000 unique users within those two 13,000 unique users within those two 13,000 unique users within those two years and 10 months and this is the first thing that months and this is the first thing that months and this is the first thing that we see okay which products are the ones we see okay which products are the ones we see okay which products are the ones that are most interesting to our that are most interesting to our that are most interesting to our customers or which are the Cisco customers or which are the Cisco customers or which are the Cisco products that the customers come to us products that the customers come to us products that the customers come to us looking for TPS vulnerability looking for TPS vulnerability looking for TPS vulnerability information demos and I'm not going to information demos and I'm not going to information demos and I'm not going to read the list because hopefully we all read the list because hopefully we all read the list because hopefully we all we all can read. Okay. So the first one we all can read. Okay. So the first one we all can read. Okay. So the first one Cisco XOS software identity service Cisco XOS software identity service Cisco XOS software identity service engine. I said that I wasn't but I'm engine. I said that I wasn't but I'm engine. I said that I wasn't but I'm going to um and I start because the going to um and I start because the going to um and I start because the duality of man, right? Um and then I duality of man, right? Um and then I duality of man, right? Um and then I starting from the bottom the Cisco starting from the bottom the Cisco starting from the bottom the Cisco security appliance software. Now this is security appliance software. Now this is security appliance software. Now this is this is interesting to us. This is this is interesting to us. This is this is interesting to us. This is interesting to us because be I mean we interesting to us because be I mean we interesting to us because be I mean we had some ideas. We have some products had some ideas. We have some products had some ideas. We have some products that are Cisco flagship products. Okay. that are Cisco flagship products. Okay. that are Cisco flagship products. Okay. I mean, we sell a lot of hardware, but I mean, we sell a lot of hardware, but I mean, we sell a lot of hardware, but at the end of the day, most of that at the end of the day, most of that at the end of the day, most of that hardware runs either Cisco XR or Cisco hardware runs either Cisco XR or Cisco hardware runs either Cisco XR or Cisco XCE or Cisco Classic or Cisco XOS. This XCE or Cisco Classic or Cisco XOS. This XCE or Cisco Classic or Cisco XOS. This was super interesting to us because it was super interesting to us because it was super interesting to us because it allow us to actually see of all those allow us to actually see of all those allow us to actually see of all those flagship products which are the ones flagship products which are the ones flagship products which are the ones that the customers actually are looking that the customers actually are looking that the customers actually are looking at the most or are interested the most. at the most or are interested the most. at the most or are interested the most. And and I'm going to tell you that some And and I'm going to tell you that some And and I'm going to tell you that some of those products truly surprise us. of those products truly surprise us. of those products truly surprise us. Now going back, this is super wild. Um, Now going back, this is super wild. Um, Now going back, this is super wild. Um, it says there 170,000 valid records. And it says there 170,000 valid records. And it says there 170,000 valid records. And before anybody says, "Wow, but 95,000 is before anybody says, "Wow, but 95,000 is before anybody says, "Wow, but 95,000 is not 67% of 170,000." Yes, it's because not 67% of 170,000." Yes, it's because not 67% of 170,000." Yes, it's because if you remember, we said that we have if you remember, we said that we have if you remember, we said that we have two different flavors. The broad query two different flavors. The broad query two different flavors. The broad query and the narrow query. When you do the and the narrow query. When you do the and the narrow query. When you do the broad query, you may enter just a CV ID. broad query, you may enter just a CV ID. broad query, you may enter just a CV ID. you do not provide enough information at you do not provide enough information at you do not provide enough information at that point for us to collect product that point for us to collect product that point for us to collect product platform release etc. So this data set platform release etc. So this data set platform release etc. So this data set is slightly redusted. It's only 142,000. is slightly redusted. It's only 142,000. is slightly redusted. It's only 142,000. But even then this is the this is the But even then this is the this is the But even then this is the this is the point. Okay. 10% or 10 products are 70% point. Okay. 10% or 10 products are 70% point. Okay. 10% or 10 products are 70% of the queries against the tool. Just 10 of the queries against the tool. Just 10 of the queries against the tool. Just 10 products. And again this is 7700 CBS. products. And again this is 7700 CBS. products. And again this is 7700 CBS. The next one really surprises The next one really surprises The next one really surprises me. Not every CV is super popular. Okay. me. Not every CV is super popular. Okay. me. Not every CV is super popular. Okay. It's like there is some people out there It's like there is some people out there It's like there is some people out there that is very very sad and very very that is very very sad and very very that is very very sad and very very lonely. lonely. lonely. Um Um Um so so so 45% of the query CV ids 3500 they were 45% of the query CV ids 3500 they were 45% of the query CV ids 3500 they were they were queried exactly they were queried exactly they were queried exactly once. Exactly once okay and before once. Exactly once okay and before once. Exactly once okay and before anybody asked we did think about hey anybody asked we did think about hey anybody asked we did think about hey maybe we should check those are typos maybe we should check those are typos maybe we should check those are typos etc. It's too much to be a typo. Okay, etc. It's too much to be a typo. Okay, etc. It's too much to be a typo. Okay, is to be too much to be a transposition is to be too much to be a transposition is to be too much to be a transposition of digits. But in any case, uh 45% were of digits. But in any case, uh 45% were of digits. But in any case, uh 45% were queried only once. The other 55% when queried only once. The other 55% when queried only once. The other 55% when were queried more than once, at least were queried more than once, at least were queried more than once, at least twice. Okay, but that doesn't actually twice. Okay, but that doesn't actually twice. Okay, but that doesn't actually mean that they are also super popular. And here is the distribution. popular. And here is the distribution. popular. And here is the distribution. And my manager when he was reviewing And my manager when he was reviewing And my manager when he was reviewing this slide was like make clear to this slide was like make clear to this slide was like make clear to explain what this is. Okay. So on that explain what this is. Okay. So on that explain what this is. Okay. So on that side what you're going to see is by CV side what you're going to see is by CV side what you're going to see is by CV ids. Okay. Group by CV ids. And on the ids. Okay. Group by CV ids. And on the ids. Okay. Group by CV ids. And on the other side is the number of queries for other side is the number of queries for other side is the number of queries for those CV ids. Okay. So in this those CV ids. Okay. So in this those CV ids. Okay. So in this particular case we see that particular case we see that particular case we see that 90% of those 7700 CBIDs had less than 90% of those 7700 CBIDs had less than 90% of those 7700 CBIDs had less than 100 queries. Okay. 100 queries. Okay. 100 queries. Okay. 98% had less than 100 queries. Now, how 98% had less than 100 queries. Now, how 98% had less than 100 queries. Now, how many queries is that? That is 44,000 many queries is that? That is 44,000 many queries is that? That is 44,000 queries. Okay. So, 98% of the CBE IDs queries. Okay. So, 98% of the CBE IDs queries. Okay. So, 98% of the CBE IDs had only or just 45 um yeah 45,000 had only or just 45 um yeah 45,000 had only or just 45 um yeah 45,000 queries. And then the rest between 100 queries. And then the rest between 100 queries. And then the rest between 100 and 499, between 500 and a,000 and above and 499, between 500 and a,000 and above and 499, between 500 and a,000 and above 1,000. Super interesting. again at least 1,000. Super interesting. again at least 1,000. Super interesting. again at least to us is that only 17 17 CBIDs which is to us is that only 17 17 CBIDs which is to us is that only 17 17 CBIDs which is less than a quarter of 1% only 17 CBIDs less than a quarter of 1% only 17 CBIDs less than a quarter of 1% only 17 CBIDs had more than a thousand queries and had more than a thousand queries and had more than a thousand queries and those 17 CBIDs represent more than 50% those 17 CBIDs represent more than 50% those 17 CBIDs represent more than 50% of the queries okay so it's it's a huge of the queries okay so it's it's a huge of the queries okay so it's it's a huge um a glutination of a lot of queries um a glutination of a lot of queries um a glutination of a lot of queries center on a very small number of CBIDs. center on a very small number of CBIDs. center on a very small number of CBIDs. And um before I And um before I And um before I forget, this is data from our systems, forget, this is data from our systems, forget, this is data from our systems, from our customers about our from our customers about our from our customers about our products. I think it's interesting to products. I think it's interesting to products. I think it's interesting to share and that's why I'm here. It's share and that's why I'm here. It's share and that's why I'm here. It's interesting to share it with you. that I interesting to share it with you. that I interesting to share it with you. that I will not try to transpose or expand or will not try to transpose or expand or will not try to transpose or expand or take this information to your own take this information to your own take this information to your own products or your own services or products or your own services or products or your own services or whatever. Okay, this is what of interest whatever. Okay, this is what of interest whatever. Okay, this is what of interest to our customers for our products for to our customers for our products for to our customers for our products for those CBDs that they consider of those CBDs that they consider of those CBDs that they consider of interest to them. They may pro may not interest to them. They may pro may not interest to them. They may pro may not may probably not be absolutely may probably not be absolutely may probably not be absolutely translatable to any other product or any translatable to any other product or any translatable to any other product or any other customer base. other customer base. other customer base. The next one The next one The next one is separated or split by CBSS 3.1 base is separated or split by CBSS 3.1 base is separated or split by CBSS 3.1 base score. And here again we go and we see score. And here again we go and we see score. And here again we go and we see that out of the that out of the that out of the 7700 911 CBIDs less than 12% have a 7700 911 CBIDs less than 12% have a 7700 911 CBIDs less than 12% have a basis score of critical 42% have a score basis score of critical 42% have a score basis score of critical 42% have a score of high and then the rest is mediums and of high and then the rest is mediums and of high and then the rest is mediums and lows. What is interesting here is that lows. What is interesting here is that lows. What is interesting here is that the mediums and lows, okay, are um the mediums and lows, okay, are um the mediums and lows, okay, are um 55%. So 55% of the CVE ids have a CBSS 55%. So 55% of the CVE ids have a CBSS 55%. So 55% of the CVE ids have a CBSS base score of either medium and low. And base score of either medium and low. And base score of either medium and low. And again, this this goes because when we're again, this this goes because when we're again, this this goes because when we're looking at the data is what are the looking at the data is what are the looking at the data is what are the patterns that we can see? Are people are patterns that we can see? Are people are patterns that we can see? Are people are people asking about critical CVs? Are people asking about critical CVs? Are people asking about critical CVs? Are asking about high CVs? And what we see asking about high CVs? And what we see asking about high CVs? And what we see is is is that maybe okay but also mediums and that maybe okay but also mediums and that maybe okay but also mediums and also and the next one is also super also and the next one is also super also and the next one is also super interesting because at least to us the interesting because at least to us the interesting because at least to us the number of queries between medium CBSS number of queries between medium CBSS number of queries between medium CBSS 3.1 basis score and low CBSS.1 is 55% of 3.1 basis score and low CBSS.1 is 55% of 3.1 basis score and low CBSS.1 is 55% of all queries. So more than 50% of the all queries. So more than 50% of the all queries. So more than 50% of the queries is for CBIDs with a basis score queries is for CBIDs with a basis score queries is for CBIDs with a basis score of medium or low. Okay. So if anybody of medium or low. Okay. So if anybody of medium or low. Okay. So if anybody here is like, oh probably, you know, here is like, oh probably, you know, here is like, oh probably, you know, it's going to be queries about the highs it's going to be queries about the highs it's going to be queries about the highs and security. No, not really. Okay. The kept catalog. Okay. This is Okay. The kept catalog. Okay. This is Okay. The kept catalog. Okay. This is also another thing that for us is of also another thing that for us is of also another thing that for us is of interest. How many of those I see that interest. How many of those I see that interest. How many of those I see that it's also of interest to you, right? Um it's also of interest to you, right? Um it's also of interest to you, right? Um so how many of those CBIDs are present so how many of those CBIDs are present so how many of those CBIDs are present on the cape catalog? Only on the cape catalog? Only on the cape catalog? Only 413. Okay. So less than 6% of the query 413. Okay. So less than 6% of the query 413. Okay. So less than 6% of the query CVE ids are present in the C catalog. CVE ids are present in the C catalog. CVE ids are present in the C catalog. And once again considering number of And once again considering number of And once again considering number of requests that 413 requests that 413 requests that 413 CBDs it's only 5% of all the queries CBDs it's only 5% of all the queries CBDs it's only 5% of all the queries being performed. Now careful here okay being performed. Now careful here okay being performed. Now careful here okay because as we know on the cape catalog because as we know on the cape catalog because as we know on the cape catalog you had both um open source you had both um open source you had both um open source vulnerabilities and non-opensource vulnerabilities and non-opensource vulnerabilities and non-opensource vulnerabilities okay so we cannot vulnerabilities okay so we cannot vulnerabilities okay so we cannot immediately says like oh well only 5% immediately says like oh well only 5% immediately says like oh well only 5% yeah only 5% of all the CV IDs but also yeah only 5% of all the CV IDs but also yeah only 5% of all the CV IDs but also consider the distribution and I'm I'm consider the distribution and I'm I'm consider the distribution and I'm I'm going to be honest with you nobody going to be honest with you nobody going to be honest with you nobody please ask nobody asked the question please ask nobody asked the question please ask nobody asked the question okay how many of the CV IDs on the ke okay how many of the CV IDs on the ke okay how many of the CV IDs on the ke catalog are about TPS components versus catalog are about TPS components versus catalog are about TPS components versus commercial software components because I commercial software components because I commercial software components because I thought about calculating that and I thought about calculating that and I thought about calculating that and I didn't. Okay? So, don't ask me that didn't. Okay? So, don't ask me that didn't. Okay? So, don't ask me that question. Do not ask me that question. question. question. And probably we are wondering about And probably we are wondering about And probably we are wondering about this. These are the 15 most query CBDs. this. These are the 15 most query CBDs. this. These are the 15 most query CBDs. And I'm going to tell you that this was And I'm going to tell you that this was And I'm going to tell you that this was a surprise to us. This truly was a a surprise to us. This truly was a a surprise to us. This truly was a surprise to us. surprise to us. surprise to us. However, after we recover from the shock However, after we recover from the shock However, after we recover from the shock and surprise, it shouldn't be so much of and surprise, it shouldn't be so much of and surprise, it shouldn't be so much of a surprise, right? So, a surprise, right? So, a surprise, right? So, um very very cluster, right? Out of um very very cluster, right? Out of um very very cluster, right? Out of those 15 most query those 15 most query those 15 most query CBDs, 14 of those I'm going to I'm going CBDs, 14 of those I'm going to I'm going CBDs, 14 of those I'm going to I'm going to be careful to be careful to be careful here. 13 of those are about a single here. 13 of those are about a single here. 13 of those are about a single open source package open SSH. The most open source package open SSH. The most open source package open SSH. The most query CBD is about the SSH protocol in query CBD is about the SSH protocol in query CBD is about the SSH protocol in general. So it will apply to open SSH general. So it will apply to open SSH general. So it will apply to open SSH etc. And just one of them is about etc. And just one of them is about etc. And just one of them is about something else. Okay. And that is active something else. Okay. And that is active something else. Okay. And that is active MQ. Now the top component or the top CV MQ. Now the top component or the top CV MQ. Now the top component or the top CV most queried is most queried is most queried is terapin. Okay. So you probably heard terapin. Okay. So you probably heard terapin. Okay. So you probably heard about therapin before. Um and that's about therapin before. Um and that's about therapin before. Um and that's about it. Okay. Um, going back for a about it. Okay. Um, going back for a about it. Okay. Um, going back for a second, why you shouldn't be surprised second, why you shouldn't be surprised second, why you shouldn't be surprised because as many of the products that we because as many of the products that we because as many of the products that we sell are network devices, I think that sell are network devices, I think that sell are network devices, I think that it makes sense for our customer base to it makes sense for our customer base to it makes sense for our customer base to be concerned about any vulnerability be concerned about any vulnerability be concerned about any vulnerability that could be exploited for a that could be exploited for a that could be exploited for a network-based protocol that they are network-based protocol that they are network-based protocol that they are using to actually manage and administer using to actually manage and administer using to actually manage and administer the product. Okay, so as I said, it was the product. Okay, so as I said, it was the product. Okay, so as I said, it was a little bit of surprise, but looking a little bit of surprise, but looking a little bit of surprise, but looking back, it should have been such a big back, it should have been such a big back, it should have been such a big surprise. And man, I'm just flying surprise. And man, I'm just flying surprise. And man, I'm just flying through it. And now, very similar to the it. And now, very similar to the it. And now, very similar to the previous one, we were looking at score previous one, we were looking at score previous one, we were looking at score distribution for all the vulnerabilities distribution for all the vulnerabilities distribution for all the vulnerabilities being queried. Now, when we actually being queried. Now, when we actually being queried. Now, when we actually focus about those 15 that we were focus about those 15 that we were focus about those 15 that we were looking before, okay, what is the score looking before, okay, what is the score looking before, okay, what is the score distribution? And once distribution? And once distribution? And once again, 40 48% of those again, 40 48% of those again, 40 48% of those vulnerabilities scores um between medium vulnerabilities scores um between medium vulnerabilities scores um between medium and low and the other ones are scoring and low and the other ones are scoring and low and the other ones are scoring high or critical. When we're talking high or critical. When we're talking high or critical. When we're talking about request, about request, about request, 70,000% of the requests for these 15, 70,000% of the requests for these 15, 70,000% of the requests for these 15, okay, for these 15 okay, for these 15 okay, for these 15 vulnerabilities, they went to median vulnerabilities, they went to median vulnerabilities, they went to median scoring vulnerability. So that is scoring vulnerability. So that is scoring vulnerability. So that is telling me that the customers are not as telling me that the customers are not as telling me that the customers are not as much concerned as an example about the much concerned as an example about the much concerned as an example about the CBSS score of the vulnerability but is CBSS score of the vulnerability but is CBSS score of the vulnerability but is more of a trigger effect. Okay. Oh, the more of a trigger effect. Okay. Oh, the more of a trigger effect. Okay. Oh, the vulnerability affects Open SSH. I vulnerability affects Open SSH. I vulnerability affects Open SSH. I immediately want to know if the product immediately want to know if the product immediately want to know if the product is affected by the vulnerability. We is affected by the vulnerability. We is affected by the vulnerability. We also saw the same before on the on the also saw the same before on the on the also saw the same before on the on the previous slide. Okay. When we see a previous slide. Okay. When we see a previous slide. Okay. When we see a distribution about all the distribution about all the distribution about all the vulnerabilities being queried, we don't vulnerabilities being queried, we don't vulnerabilities being queried, we don't see a strong bias toward quering for see a strong bias toward quering for see a strong bias toward quering for high-end critical CVids. We see that is high-end critical CVids. We see that is high-end critical CVids. We see that is more than 50% of those wereful more than 50% of those wereful more than 50% of those wereful vulnerabilities scoring low or um medium vulnerabilities scoring low or um medium vulnerabilities scoring low or um medium on the CBSS 3.1 basis score. Um so yeah on the CBSS 3.1 basis score. Um so yeah on the CBSS 3.1 basis score. Um so yeah so that was also interesting for us and for the top 100 again we look at us and for the top 100 again we look at us and for the top 100 again we look at all the all the all the 7700 CV ids that were queried then we 7700 CV ids that were queried then we 7700 CV ids that were queried then we look at the 15 more queries for the top look at the 15 more queries for the top look at the 15 more queries for the top 100 most query CV ids this is a 100 most query CV ids this is a 100 most query CV ids this is a distribution at the TPS component distribution at the TPS component distribution at the TPS component affected affected affected So So So oops sorry about that. Okay, so oops sorry about that. Okay, so oops sorry about that. Okay, so 22 of those CVE ids, 22 of the top 100 22 of those CVE ids, 22 of the top 100 22 of those CVE ids, 22 of the top 100 were about open were about open were about open SSH. SSH. SSH. 23 about OpenSSL. Okay, so between these 23 about OpenSSL. Okay, so between these 23 about OpenSSL. Okay, so between these two components, Open SSH and OpenSSL we two components, Open SSH and OpenSSL we two components, Open SSH and OpenSSL we have almost 50% of the most query DPS have almost 50% of the most query DPS have almost 50% of the most query DPS components. Then the rest we have Apache components. Then the rest we have Apache components. Then the rest we have Apache Tomcat. Okay, 11% not bad. We are going Tomcat. Okay, 11% not bad. We are going Tomcat. Okay, 11% not bad. We are going to get back to this to get back to this to get back to this later. Five of those will five of those later. Five of those will five of those later. Five of those will five of those CBDs were for core or lib core. Two for CBDs were for core or lib core. Two for CBDs were for core or lib core. Two for strats in here is the big you know the strats in here is the big you know the strats in here is the big you know the other 25% is everything else and other 25% is everything else and other 25% is everything else and everything else is Linux kernel. everything else is Linux kernel. everything else is Linux kernel. Everything else is CX. Okay, you Everything else is CX. Okay, you Everything else is CX. Okay, you everybody here remembers when ZX was everybody here remembers when ZX was everybody here remembers when ZX was trojanized and made it into Open SSH trojanized and made it into Open SSH trojanized and made it into Open SSH um active MPQ um active MPQ um active MPQ NGX low 4J nobody nobody nobody asked NGX low 4J nobody nobody nobody asked NGX low 4J nobody nobody nobody asked yeah lo forj wasn't a big one okay no yeah lo forj wasn't a big one okay no yeah lo forj wasn't a big one okay no not a lot of people asking about lo forj not a lot of people asking about lo forj not a lot of people asking about lo forj and and there is a reason for that and this is kind of funny because that and this is kind of funny because that and this is kind of funny because if you remember at the beginning I said if you remember at the beginning I said if you remember at the beginning I said CVR has information about CVR has information about CVR has information about vulnerabilities in TPS components. Okay, vulnerabilities in TPS components. Okay, vulnerabilities in TPS components. Okay, it doesn't have information about CBIDs it doesn't have information about CBIDs it doesn't have information about CBIDs for Cisco for Cisco for Cisco vulnerabilities. And yet and yet 10 of vulnerabilities. And yet and yet 10 of vulnerabilities. And yet and yet 10 of the top 100 most query CV ids are Cisco the top 100 most query CV ids are Cisco the top 100 most query CV ids are Cisco CVIDs. So either we don't write our CVIDs. So either we don't write our CVIDs. So either we don't write our documentation right or our customers are documentation right or our customers are documentation right or our customers are not reading the documentation. But it's not reading the documentation. But it's not reading the documentation. But it's okay. Okay, this is actually okay and okay. Okay, this is actually okay and okay. Okay, this is actually okay and we're going to talk about why it is okay we're going to talk about why it is okay we're going to talk about why it is okay later. So, so far what I've been talking later. So, so far what I've been talking later. So, so far what I've been talking about is CVR queries. somebody come into about is CVR queries. somebody come into about is CVR queries. somebody come into the GUI, enter a CV ID and either the GUI, enter a CV ID and either the GUI, enter a CV ID and either selecting a product platform and release selecting a product platform and release selecting a product platform and release on the spot or just entering the CV ID, on the spot or just entering the CV ID, on the spot or just entering the CV ID, getting the whole listing, start looking getting the whole listing, start looking getting the whole listing, start looking through them and in some cases maybe um through them and in some cases maybe um through them and in some cases maybe um requesting a status, requesting an assessment. What about VEX? Okay, when we first put CVI CVR in Okay, when we first put CVI CVR in Okay, when we first put CVI CVR in production in May of 2022, there was no production in May of 2022, there was no production in May of 2022, there was no BEX download capability. Okay, at that BEX download capability. Okay, at that BEX download capability. Okay, at that moment, we only have the query moment, we only have the query moment, we only have the query capabilities and request the assessment capabilities and request the assessment capabilities and request the assessment of a given vulnerability. You did not of a given vulnerability. You did not of a given vulnerability. You did not have the capability to download a VEX have the capability to download a VEX have the capability to download a VEX document. We added that in June of 2023, document. We added that in June of 2023, document. We added that in June of 2023, one year, 10 months approximately as of one year, 10 months approximately as of one year, 10 months approximately as of today. And since today. And since today. And since then we have seen a total of 6,589 beex document being downloaded. 6,589 beex document being downloaded. 6,589 beex document being downloaded. And And And those a little bit less than 7,000 beex those a little bit less than 7,000 beex those a little bit less than 7,000 beex documents. They represent 89 89 um documents. They represent 89 89 um documents. They represent 89 89 um products. We offer 252 products. You can products. We offer 252 products. You can products. We offer 252 products.

Again a very very small number of all Again a very very small number of all Again a very very small number of all the CBIDs being queried it's like I the CBIDs being queried it's like I the CBIDs being queried it's like I think that is less than a quarter or think that is less than a quarter or think that is less than a quarter or 1% account for more than 50% of the 1% account for more than 50% of the 1% account for more than 50% of the queries. There is a lot of clustering on queries. There is a lot of clustering on queries. There is a lot of clustering on this very small number of this very small number of this very small number of CVIDs. 45% of the query CVIDs as we said CVIDs. 45% of the query CVIDs as we said CVIDs. 45% of the query CVIDs as we said before they have a CBSS B score of low before they have a CBSS B score of low before they have a CBSS B score of low or medium. So clearly you know looking or medium. So clearly you know looking or medium. So clearly you know looking at the base CBSS score it's not the at the base CBSS score it's not the at the base CBSS score it's not the hugest priority of our customers. 50% of hugest priority of our customers. 50% of hugest priority of our customers. 50% of the most queries again are median or the most queries again are median or the most queries again are median or low. 14 of the top 15 are about either low. 14 of the top 15 are about either low. 14 of the top 15 are about either Open SSH or the SSH protocol and 60% of Open SSH or the SSH protocol and 60% of Open SSH or the SSH protocol and 60% of the top 10 of the top 100 most query CV the top 10 of the top 100 most query CV the top 10 of the top 100 most query CV ids are about just four TPS components ids are about just four TPS components ids are about just four TPS components open SSH open SSL active MQ and curl lib open SSH open SSL active MQ and curl lib open SSH open SSL active MQ and curl lib cur the funny thing of having a summary cur the funny thing of having a summary cur the funny thing of having a summary slide is that I have a second summary slide is that I have a second summary slide is that I have a second summary slide so I guess it wasn't that much of slide so I guess it wasn't that much of slide so I guess it wasn't that much of a summary a summary a summary Uh well I am not part of the development well I am not part of the development well I am not part of the development team developing this code. So can can team developing this code. So can can team developing this code. So can can you repeat the question? you repeat the question? you repeat the question? Sorry. Um yeah the question is if we Sorry. Um yeah the question is if we Sorry. Um yeah the question is if we have enough information to still justify have enough information to still justify have enough information to still justify the air the return of investment of the air the return of investment of the air the return of investment of continue to doing this VEX work. Is that continue to doing this VEX work. Is that continue to doing this VEX work. Is that correct? Yes. Well, we think that there correct? Yes. Well, we think that there correct? Yes. Well, we think that there is because we have high hopes for the is because we have high hopes for the is because we have high hopes for the future. That was a chuckles for future. That was a chuckles for future. That was a chuckles for somebody, but it's true. And you're somebody, but it's true. And you're somebody, but it's true. And you're gonna and you're gonna and you're gonna gonna and you're gonna and you're gonna gonna and you're gonna and you're gonna see or you're gonna see why. see or you're gonna see why. see or you're gonna see why. Okay. But yes, it's it's certainly and Okay. But yes, it's it's certainly and Okay. But yes, it's it's certainly and and and again, I I ran super quickly to and and again, I I ran super quickly to and and again, I I ran super quickly to my slides because I was afraid I was my slides because I was afraid I was my slides because I was afraid I was going to run out of time, but we're going to run out of time, but we're going to run out of time, but we're seeing interesting things. Okay, we we seeing interesting things. Okay, we we seeing interesting things. Okay, we we think that and this is with the utmost think that and this is with the utmost think that and this is with the utmost respect to everybody. I think that we respect to everybody. I think that we respect to everybody. I think that we move faster than our customer move faster than our customer move faster than our customer base. And how do we know that? Because base. And how do we know that? Because base. And how do we know that? Because we see many customers that come to us we see many customers that come to us we see many customers that come to us looking for this information. They say, looking for this information. They say, looking for this information. They say, "Hey, I want this vulnerability "Hey, I want this vulnerability "Hey, I want this vulnerability information. I want to know this information. I want to know this information. I want to know this product." And that that has been product." And that that has been product." And that that has been happening for since I long I've been at happening for since I long I've been at happening for since I long I've been at Cisco, which is now more than 25 years. Cisco, which is now more than 25 years. Cisco, which is now more than 25 years. Okay. People come in asking does this Okay. People come in asking does this Okay. People come in asking does this vulnerability affect my product? Yes or vulnerability affect my product? Yes or vulnerability affect my product? Yes or not? All the time. All the time. Okay. not? All the time. All the time. Okay. not? All the time. All the time. Okay. The technical assistance center, the The technical assistance center, the The technical assistance center, the support guys, it's it's very common for support guys, it's it's very common for support guys, it's it's very common for them and and we are working with them on them and and we are working with them on them and and we are working with them on that. It's very common for customers to that. It's very common for customers to that. It's very common for customers to open a case and just attach a security open a case and just attach a security open a case and just attach a security scanner report and said, "Tell me." scanner report and said, "Tell me." scanner report and said, "Tell me." Okay. and they want to know because they Okay. and they want to know because they Okay. and they want to know because they scanned a set of assets or whatever and scanned a set of assets or whatever and scanned a set of assets or whatever and they want to know if those they want to know if those they want to know if those vulnerabilities apply to the version etc vulnerabilities apply to the version etc vulnerabilities apply to the version etc etc etc. Now what I'm saying that we etc etc. Now what I'm saying that we etc etc. Now what I'm saying that we move faster than our customers is move faster than our customers is move faster than our customers is because again the customers are asking because again the customers are asking because again the customers are asking for this vulnerability information. Does for this vulnerability information. Does for this vulnerability information. Does it apply? Does it not apply? Can you it apply? Does it not apply? Can you it apply? Does it not apply? Can you tell me if it applies or not? And in tell me if it applies or not? And in tell me if it applies or not? And in many cases when we send them to the CBR many cases when we send them to the CBR many cases when we send them to the CBR and say hey you know what go and find and say hey you know what go and find and say hey you know what go and find yourself and download the vex document yourself and download the vex document yourself and download the vex document etc. In many cases they come back and etc. In many cases they come back and etc. In many cases they come back and says don't you have an Excel spreadsheet? So yes and and and the spreadsheet? So yes and and and the spreadsheet? So yes and and and the answer before anybody else ask is no. I answer before anybody else ask is no. I answer before anybody else ask is no. I don't we don't we don't we don't speak don't we don't we don't we don't speak don't we don't we don't we don't speak Excel here. Okay. So that's what I'm Excel here. Okay. So that's what I'm Excel here. Okay. So that's what I'm saying the interest is there. It's just saying the interest is there. It's just saying the interest is there. It's just that we think that in many cases our that we think that in many cases our that we think that in many cases our customers have not our customers and customers have not our customers and customers have not our customers and their tools and we're going to talk their tools and we're going to talk their tools and we're going to talk about that for a second. Okay. Have not about that for a second. Okay. Have not about that for a second. Okay. Have not kept up. So the need is there. They are kept up. So the need is there. They are kept up. So the need is there. They are not getting inex because either they not getting inex because either they not getting inex because either they can't or their tools cannot process. And can't or their tools cannot process. And can't or their tools cannot process. And for me, I mean, I I'm so grateful that I for me, I mean, I I'm so grateful that I for me, I mean, I I'm so grateful that I attended the first presentation in this attended the first presentation in this attended the first presentation in this room today from this person from Red Hat room today from this person from Red Hat room today from this person from Red Hat because he was talking about what they because he was talking about what they because he was talking about what they are doing about VEX and and they are doing about VEX and and they are doing about VEX and and they certainly have done a lot there. But I certainly have done a lot there. But I certainly have done a lot there. But I also were he was talking about how he also were he was talking about how he also were he was talking about how he was importing VEX documents from other was importing VEX documents from other was importing VEX documents from other vendors and he had trouble parsing them vendors and he had trouble parsing them vendors and he had trouble parsing them and and here's here's here's an internal and and here's here's here's an internal and and here's here's here's an internal Cisco, you know, joke from my team. We Cisco, you know, joke from my team. We Cisco, you know, joke from my team. We we say nobody comes complaining about we say nobody comes complaining about we say nobody comes complaining about not being able to parse the documents. not being able to parse the documents. not being able to parse the documents. So either they are perfect or nobody's So either they are perfect or nobody's So either they are perfect or nobody's actually reading them. Okay. So yeah, a actually reading them. Okay. So yeah, a actually reading them. Okay. So yeah, a lot of So does this answer your lot of So does this answer your lot of So does this answer your question? We are investing in a future question? We are investing in a future question? We are investing in a future that is going to be that is going to be that is going to be bright. We bright. We bright. We hope. Hey Dario. Um I think you just hope. Hey Dario. Um I think you just hope. Hey Dario. Um I think you just made a new feature request for my Python made a new feature request for my Python made a new feature request for my Python script to export to Excel um for script to export to Excel um for script to export to Excel um for for CSV. Yeah. Yep. Exactly. Um I do for CSV. Yeah. Yep. Exactly. Um I do for CSV. Yeah. Yep. Exactly. Um I do think it's it's interesting like a lot think it's it's interesting like a lot think it's it's interesting like a lot of the data that you have and I and of the data that you have and I and of the data that you have and I and maybe it's not particularly pertinent to maybe it's not particularly pertinent to maybe it's not particularly pertinent to the VEX part but uh from what I was the VEX part but uh from what I was the VEX part but uh from what I was seeing there was a lot of focus by your seeing there was a lot of focus by your seeing there was a lot of focus by your customers on like the moderate and low customers on like the moderate and low customers on like the moderate and low vulnerabilities as opposed to the vulnerabilities as opposed to the vulnerabilities as opposed to the criticals and highs. Now I don't know criticals and highs. Now I don't know criticals and highs. Now I don't know what uh Cisco's like response policy is what uh Cisco's like response policy is what uh Cisco's like response policy is but do you fix all like everything but do you fix all like everything but do you fix all like everything that's on your CV pages or vex documents that's on your CV pages or vex documents that's on your CV pages or vex documents is it all fixed? It's all what is it all is it all fixed? It's all what is it all is it all fixed? It's all what is it all fixed? In some cases it is, in some fixed? In some cases it is, in some fixed? In some cases it is, in some cases it's not and it will be fixed and cases it's not and it will be fixed and cases it's not and it will be fixed and in some cases it's not fixed and it will in some cases it's not fixed and it will in some cases it's not fixed and it will not be fixed. Okay. Because that I think not be fixed. Okay. Because that I think not be fixed. Okay. Because that I think another data point that would be another data point that would be another data point that would be interesting for you and I've actually interesting for you and I've actually interesting for you and I've actually learned a lot as well is maybe looking learned a lot as well is maybe looking learned a lot as well is maybe looking for the ones that aren't fixed and is for the ones that aren't fixed and is for the ones that aren't fixed and is that where you're getting the most that where you're getting the most that where you're getting the most queries for because on our side because queries for because on our side because queries for because on our side because we fix all criticals and importance I we fix all criticals and importance I we fix all criticals and importance I don't expect customers to look for don't expect customers to look for don't expect customers to look for those. They just DNF update and they're those. They just DNF update and they're those. They just DNF update and they're done. is the moderates and lows that we done. is the moderates and lows that we done. is the moderates and lows that we don't fix that they tend to come to us don't fix that they tend to come to us don't fix that they tend to come to us with questions about. Okay. And I'm just with questions about. Okay. And I'm just with questions about. Okay. And I'm just wondering if that's maybe the case for wondering if that's maybe the case for wondering if that's maybe the case for you as well. I I didn't No, I didn't not you as well. I I didn't No, I didn't not you as well. I I didn't No, I didn't not I did but yeah certainly it's that's I did but yeah certainly it's that's I did but yeah certainly it's that's another Thank you. I appreciate because another Thank you. I appreciate because another Thank you. I appreciate because I didn't think about doing that. I did I I didn't think about doing that. I did I I didn't think about doing that. I did I did spend a lot of time with the data did spend a lot of time with the data did spend a lot of time with the data and I did a lot of things that I will and I did a lot of things that I will and I did a lot of things that I will even ashamed to share with you.

Like which day of the weeks are the ones Like which day of the weeks are the ones Like which day of the weeks are the ones that people queries? Do people work on the weekends? queries? Do people work on the weekends? queries? Do people work on the weekends? And the answer is depends on which time And the answer is depends on which time And the answer is depends on which time zone you live. We do have a question from the live. We do have a question from the live. We do have a question from the Discord. Um I'm going try to read it uh Discord. Um I'm going try to read it uh Discord. Um I'm going try to read it uh from Wilfred. Hello. I have a quick from Wilfred. Hello. I have a quick from Wilfred. Hello. I have a quick question. Why today Cisco does not question. Why today Cisco does not question. Why today Cisco does not publish thirdparty vulnerabilities publish thirdparty vulnerabilities publish thirdparty vulnerabilities affecting Cisco products when we had affecting Cisco products when we had affecting Cisco products when we had multiple in the past such as open SSL, multiple in the past such as open SSL, multiple in the past such as open SSL, open SSH bind. We have to check now open SSH bind. We have to check now open SSH bind. We have to check now every product change log to check if every product change log to check if every product change log to check if there is some dependency there has been there is some dependency there has been there is some dependency there has been updated because we have CVR now all the updated because we have CVR now all the updated because we have CVR now all the data. Why not creating human readable data. Why not creating human readable data. Why not creating human readable advisories on your main page? because we have decided to make this because we have decided to make this because we have decided to make this information available as vex information available as vex information available as vex documents because I think documents because I think documents because I think that making this information available that making this information available that making this information available as an example in HTML or whatever it's as an example in HTML or whatever it's as an example in HTML or whatever it's it's a little bit of a losing it's a little bit of a losing it's a little bit of a losing proposition. I mean I can make it proposition. I mean I can make it proposition. I mean I can make it available on beex and then the gentleman available on beex and then the gentleman available on beex and then the gentleman from Red Hat is going to write us a tool from Red Hat is going to write us a tool from Red Hat is going to write us a tool that is going to read the VEX and that is going to read the VEX and that is going to read the VEX and convert to convert to convert to HTML. Thank you. Thank you. I have a HTML. Thank you. Thank you. I have a HTML. Thank you. Thank you. I have a Cisco share for you. Um, but if you if Cisco share for you. Um, but if you if Cisco share for you. Um, but if you if you make it happen, if you make it you make it happen, if you make it you make it happen, if you make it happen. Okay. Um, but I'm sorry, happen. Okay. Um, but I'm sorry, happen. Okay. Um, but I'm sorry, what? Yes. What what people does for a what? Yes. What what people does for a what? Yes. What what people does for a show, right? Um, and we're not going to show, right? Um, and we're not going to show, right? Um, and we're not going to go there. Um, but yeah, I don't I don't go there. Um, but yeah, I don't I don't go there. Um, but yeah, I don't I don't think that and and we're going to talk think that and and we're going to talk think that and and we're going to talk about that in in the before last slide a about that in in the before last slide a about that in in the before last slide a little bit. little bit. little bit. Okay. So, I have this gentleman over Okay. So, I have this gentleman over Okay. So, I have this gentleman over here. I mean I think that you were to here. I mean I think that you were to here. I mean I think that you were to Okay, you can wait. Okay, well good for Okay, you can wait. Okay, well good for Okay, you can wait. Okay, well good for you. So uh my question would be thank you. So uh my question would be thank you. So uh my question would be thank you for the graphs and for the severity you for the graphs and for the severity you for the graphs and for the severity of the vulnerabilities. Do you at Cisco of the vulnerabilities. Do you at Cisco of the vulnerabilities. Do you at Cisco also evaluate how the uh what the impact also evaluate how the uh what the impact also evaluate how the uh what the impact of the vulnerability to your product of the vulnerability to your product of the vulnerability to your product is? So because my question would be is? So because my question would be is? So because my question would be would these these vulnerabilities still would these these vulnerabilities still would these these vulnerabilities still critical for your product critical for your product critical for your product in in that specific graph? Yeah. So in in that specific graph? Yeah. So in in that specific graph? Yeah. So because for us that's a good question. I don't want to say it depends. I don't want to say it depends. I don't want to say it depends. Okay. Um, in general, we will tend to Okay. Um, in general, we will tend to Okay. Um, in general, we will tend to agree that the basis score matches the agree that the basis score matches the agree that the basis score matches the impact to our product. Okay. In general, impact to our product. Okay. In general, impact to our product. Okay. In general, if it's a denial of service, yeah, if it's a denial of service, yeah, if it's a denial of service, yeah, because I because because it's again, because I because because it's again, because I because because it's again, okay, it's I I cannot give you a okay, it's I I cannot give you a okay, it's I I cannot give you a straight answer like no. Yes, because straight answer like no. Yes, because straight answer like no. Yes, because it's for you it's a remote code it's for you it's a remote code it's for you it's a remote code execution. For me it's a crash because I execution. For me it's a crash because I execution. For me it's a crash because I have stakeneries. Okay. So yeah um we have stakeneries. Okay. So yeah um we have stakeneries. Okay. So yeah um we give the option of each and every give the option of each and every give the option of each and every development team to perform that development team to perform that development team to perform that assessment and adjust the score based on assessment and adjust the score based on assessment and adjust the score based on their understanding of the impact of the their understanding of the impact of the their understanding of the impact of the vulnerability to their product. Okay. vulnerability to their product. Okay. vulnerability to their product. Okay. Many go with the CBSS base score. Does Many go with the CBSS base score. Does Many go with the CBSS base score. Does this answer Uh yes, perfectly. And uh this answer Uh yes, perfectly. And uh this answer Uh yes, perfectly. And uh the additional question to that would the additional question to that would the additional question to that would then be um the components that you get then be um the components that you get then be um the components that you get queried for. Did you look basically into queried for. Did you look basically into queried for. Did you look basically into what's the difference between the what's the difference between the what's the difference between the components that are queried to the components that are queried to the components that are queried to the components that are not queried in how components that are not queried in how components that are not queried in how those components can be found in a those components can be found in a those components can be found in a network through a scanner because kind network through a scanner because kind network through a scanner because kind of open SSL and open SSH I think is kind of open SSL and open SSH I think is kind of open SSL and open SSH I think is kind of lowhanging fruit type of thing and of lowhanging fruit type of thing and of lowhanging fruit type of thing and all the other important vulnerabilities all the other important vulnerabilities all the other important vulnerabilities are maybe not. That's a that's a very are maybe not. That's a that's a very are maybe not. That's a that's a very good question. anybody but that's a very good question. anybody but that's a very good question. anybody but that's a very good question and open SSH I'm going to good question and open SSH I'm going to good question and open SSH I'm going to give you but I cannot give you give you but I cannot give you give you but I cannot give you OpenSSL I cannot give you OpenSSL OpenSSL I cannot give you OpenSSL OpenSSL I cannot give you OpenSSL because truly I mean what is the logic because truly I mean what is the logic because truly I mean what is the logic that you're using if you tell me that that you're using if you tell me that that you're using if you tell me that you have a vulnerability scanner that is you have a vulnerability scanner that is you have a vulnerability scanner that is grabbing banners and checking the grabbing banners and checking the grabbing banners and checking the versions okay come to talk to me about versions okay come to talk to me about versions okay come to talk to me about NGNX come to talk to me about Apache but NGNX come to talk to me about Apache but NGNX come to talk to me about Apache but you come talk to me about OpenSSL I think OpenSSL I think OpenSSL I think that there is a lot of knee-jerk that there is a lot of knee-jerk that there is a lot of knee-jerk reaction going on reaction going on reaction going on here. Okay. I think that there is a here. Okay. I think that there is a here. Okay. I think that there is a number of number of number of customers that if they have a nice customers that if they have a nice customers that if they have a nice logo and they read about it in the New logo and they read about it in the New logo and they read about it in the New York Times, they're going to come asking York Times, they're going to come asking York Times, they're going to come asking for it. But that does not mean that it's for it. But that does not mean that it's for it. But that does not mean that it's a serious a serious a serious vulnerability. Okay. vulnerability. Okay. vulnerability. Okay. I think that customers also have I think that customers also have I think that customers also have developed a low risk tolerance for some developed a low risk tolerance for some developed a low risk tolerance for some components. Two of those being open SSL components. Two of those being open SSL components. Two of those being open SSL and open SSH and open SSH and open SSH checks. And I'm going to leave it at checks. And I'm going to leave it at checks. And I'm going to leave it at that. One question from my side. You that. One question from my side. You that. One question from my side. You talked about accounts talked about accounts talked about accounts um that uh make up those things. Does um that uh make up those things. Does um that uh make up those things. Does your statistics include um the uh your statistics include um the uh your statistics include um the uh publicly available CESF documents that publicly available CESF documents that publicly available CESF documents that you provide you provide you provide the downloads of the CISF documents? Y the downloads of the CISF documents? Y the downloads of the CISF documents? Y um no no this was specifically focused um no no this was specifically focused um no no this was specifically focused on CVR because we were focusing on two on CVR because we were focusing on two on CVR because we were focusing on two things TPS and beex beex documents. Yes, things TPS and beex beex documents. Yes, things TPS and beex beex documents. Yes, a VEX document is a CISF document using a VEX document is a CISF document using a VEX document is a CISF document using the VEX profile. Okay. But we weren't the VEX profile. Okay. But we weren't the VEX profile. Okay. But we weren't looking at the downloading of just looking at the downloading of just looking at the downloading of just advisories. Also remember that the vast advisories. Also remember that the vast advisories. Also remember that the vast majority of the Cisco advisories is not majority of the Cisco advisories is not majority of the Cisco advisories is not for for for TPS. Thanks. Thank you. I think it's TPS. Thanks. Thank you. I think it's TPS. Thanks. Thank you. I think it's your turn your turn your turn now. Oh, you don't get a second bite of now. Oh, you don't get a second bite of now. Oh, you don't get a second bite of the apple yet. Okay. Do does Cisco have any metrics related Do does Cisco have any metrics related Do does Cisco have any metrics related to the number of assessments that are to the number of assessments that are to the number of assessments that are coming through CVR since its inception? coming through CVR since its inception? coming through CVR since its inception? So you mentioned that as a user I can go So you mentioned that as a user I can go So you mentioned that as a user I can go in and request an assessment and I knew in and request an assessment and I knew in and request an assessment and I knew it. I run out of time coming through. coming through. coming through. Maybe I I would like to say ping me Maybe I I would like to say ping me Maybe I I would like to say ping me later, but I'm gonna tell you it's it's later, but I'm gonna tell you it's it's later, but I'm gonna tell you it's it's you know it's I I will need to use I you know it's I I will need to use I you know it's I I will need to use I make it you know I will use scientific make it you know I will use scientific make it you know I will use scientific notation to explain to you where in my notation to explain to you where in my notation to explain to you where in my queue is the priority to do that queue is the priority to do that queue is the priority to do that analysis now I spend so much time with analysis now I spend so much time with analysis now I spend so much time with this but yes I I started doing that and this but yes I I started doing that and this but yes I I started doing that and I just ran out of time. I just ran out of time. I just ran out of time. Sorry. Bcon Sorry. Bcon Sorry. Bcon 2026h. Okay. 2026h. Okay. 2026h. Okay. Um so I have another question. Uh great Um so I have another question. Uh great Um so I have another question. Uh great data like this is amazing. The uh my data like this is amazing. The uh my data like this is amazing. The uh my question is do you do you collect some question is do you do you collect some question is do you do you collect some sort of uh user agent information to sort of uh user agent information to sort of uh user agent information to understand what is that's actually a understand what is that's actually a understand what is that's actually a good question. Uh we do not okay I'm good question. Uh we do not okay I'm good question. Uh we do not okay I'm sorry sorry sorry but now that I see that at least one but now that I see that at least one but now that I see that at least one person interested I can go and talk to person interested I can go and talk to person interested I can go and talk to the development team. the development team. the development team. Yeah, they're probably going to tell me Yeah, they're probably going to tell me Yeah, they're probably going to tell me to, you know, get lost, but hey, you to, you know, get lost, but hey, you to, you know, get lost, but hey, you know, I can have the convers like like know, I can have the convers like like know, I can have the convers like like and they do that all the time. and they do that all the time. and they do that all the time. Um, so I want to go to the last slide Um, so I want to go to the last slide Um, so I want to go to the last slide because and and certainly happy we still because and and certainly happy we still because and and certainly happy we still have time for for for more questions, have time for for for more questions, have time for for for more questions, but it's it's important for me for the but it's it's important for me for the but it's it's important for me for the last slide because again the gentleman last slide because again the gentleman last slide because again the gentleman from Red Hat, he was looking over my from Red Hat, he was looking over my from Red Hat, he was looking over my shoulder when I was putting the deck shoulder when I was putting the deck shoulder when I was putting the deck together. Um so somebody asked uh I think it was Um so somebody asked uh I think it was Um so somebody asked uh I think it was on on discore why don't you make on on discore why don't you make on on discore why don't you make availories with others vulnerabilities availories with others vulnerabilities availories with others vulnerabilities okay I think that that partially okay I think that that partially okay I think that that partially partially will be answered by the first partially will be answered by the first partially will be answered by the first entry okay which is the entry okay which is the entry okay which is the multi-beck the multiCV beex download ad multi-beck the multiCV beex download ad multi-beck the multiCV beex download ad so far we've been talking about you can so far we've been talking about you can so far we've been talking about you can go and select a product platform and go and select a product platform and go and select a product platform and release and enter a CV ID and then you release and enter a CV ID and then you release and enter a CV ID and then you get the option to download a vex get the option to download a vex get the option to download a vex document that vex document represents document that vex document represents document that vex document represents one CVI ID for a given product platform one CVI ID for a given product platform one CVI ID for a given product platform and release combination. However, what and release combination. However, what and release combination. However, what we just added on at the end of January we just added on at the end of January we just added on at the end of January 2025 is what we call multi multiCVE or 2025 is what we call multi multiCVE or 2025 is what we call multi multiCVE or comprehensive bags on which you can comprehensive bags on which you can comprehensive bags on which you can select the product platform and release select the product platform and release select the product platform and release and not enter any CV ID and then you and not enter any CV ID and then you and not enter any CV ID and then you click on a button that says tell me click on a button that says tell me click on a button that says tell me everything you have for this product everything you have for this product everything you have for this product platform and release and we give you platform and release and we give you platform and release and we give you everything we have. So that document everything we have. So that document everything we have. So that document instead of containing a single CVA ID is instead of containing a single CVA ID is instead of containing a single CVA ID is going to contain I don't know how many going to contain I don't know how many going to contain I don't know how many uh other CBA IDs. Uh next step is we're uh other CBA IDs. Uh next step is we're uh other CBA IDs. Uh next step is we're going to be migrating what I show at the going to be migrating what I show at the going to be migrating what I show at the beginning the traditional advisories beginning the traditional advisories beginning the traditional advisories they're going to be migrating into CVR. they're going to be migrating into CVR. they're going to be migrating into CVR. That's going to happen within the next That's going to happen within the next That's going to happen within the next six months. Okay. Uh we are not going to six months. Okay. Uh we are not going to six months. Okay. Uh we are not going to be discontinuing the advisories. be discontinuing the advisories. be discontinuing the advisories. um they are just going to be presented um they are just going to be presented um they are just going to be presented in a slightly different way, but you're in a slightly different way, but you're in a slightly different way, but you're still going to have the capability to still going to have the capability to still going to have the capability to download a DEX document or a CESF download a DEX document or a CESF download a DEX document or a CESF document. Okay? And you can of course document. Okay? And you can of course document. Okay? And you can of course read the CISF and render as you read the CISF and render as you read the CISF and render as you want. And the last thing that we have is want. And the last thing that we have is want. And the last thing that we have is the I've been talking all the time about the I've been talking all the time about the I've been talking all the time about you go to this GUI, you go to CBR, you you go to this GUI, you go to CBR, you you go to this GUI, you go to CBR, you enter a CV ID, you know, you click here, enter a CV ID, you know, you click here, enter a CV ID, you know, you click here, do unload. Okay, we are um developing, do unload. Okay, we are um developing, do unload. Okay, we are um developing, we are testing uh an API that is going we are testing uh an API that is going we are testing uh an API that is going to allow customers to do that. Okay, to allow customers to do that. Okay, to allow customers to do that. Okay, instead of having to go to the web and instead of having to go to the web and instead of having to go to the web and enter selecting the product platform enter selecting the product platform enter selecting the product platform release and the CV ID and click on a release and the CV ID and click on a release and the CV ID and click on a button and here's you get click here and button and here's you get click here and button and here's you get click here and you download. Well, no, we are testing you download. Well, no, we are testing you download. Well, no, we are testing um an API that's an EFT. I don't really um an API that's an EFT. I don't really um an API that's an EFT. I don't really have a lot more data on that. I I don't have a lot more data on that. I I don't have a lot more data on that. I I don't know how that's going to be. Okay, I know how that's going to be. Okay, I know how that's going to be. Okay, I don't know what's going to happen with don't know what's going to happen with don't know what's going to happen with that API. Now, we really want to hear that API. Now, we really want to hear that API. Now, we really want to hear from you. Okay, if you are a Cisco from you. Okay, if you are a Cisco from you. Okay, if you are a Cisco customer, partner, reseller, etc., and customer, partner, reseller, etc., and customer, partner, reseller, etc., and you are using CVR, let us know. Let us you are using CVR, let us know. Let us you are using CVR, let us know. Let us know what you like and let us know what know what you like and let us know what know what you like and let us know what you don't like. Probably you like you don't like. Probably you like you don't like. Probably you like everything. Okay, but in the very everything. Okay, but in the very everything. Okay, but in the very unlikely case that there is something unlikely case that there is something unlikely case that there is something that you don't like, okay? Um, let us that you don't like, okay? Um, let us that you don't like, okay? Um, let us know. And the final one that's you know know. And the final one that's you know know. And the final one that's you know another um from Red Hat are you a vulnerability um from Red Hat are you a vulnerability um from Red Hat are you a vulnerability scanner vendor? Okay, come talk to us scanner vendor? Okay, come talk to us scanner vendor? Okay, come talk to us because for us is it hurt us so bad and because for us is it hurt us so bad and because for us is it hurt us so bad and it makes us feel so sad. it makes us feel so sad. it makes us feel so sad. Okay. It has made Swaty Swaty. It has Okay. It has made Swaty Swaty. It has Okay. It has made Swaty Swaty. It has made Swaty cry more than made Swaty cry more than made Swaty cry more than once because we have spent a lot of time once because we have spent a lot of time once because we have spent a lot of time return of investment and putting return of investment and putting return of investment and putting together these tools for I didn't talk together these tools for I didn't talk together these tools for I didn't talk about S1 I can do another talk about S1 about S1 I can do another talk about S1 about S1 I can do another talk about S1 putting together S1 putting together VEX putting together S1 putting together VEX putting together S1 putting together VEX and it kills us okay that other and it kills us okay that other and it kills us okay that other companies in the ecosystem that could be companies in the ecosystem that could be companies in the ecosystem that could be consuming this consuming this consuming this information and and using it to provide information and and using it to provide information and and using it to provide a better service to their customer and a better service to their customer and a better service to their customer and our customers aka our common customers our customers aka our common customers our customers aka our common customers and they are not doing it and that was and they are not doing it and that was and they are not doing it and that was your message too. Okay, instead of your message too. Okay, instead of your message too. Okay, instead of instead of somebody running the security instead of somebody running the security instead of somebody running the security scanner and saying, "Oh, you're running scanner and saying, "Oh, you're running scanner and saying, "Oh, you're running OpenSSL version XYZ and you have 50 OpenSSL version XYZ and you have 50 OpenSSL version XYZ and you have 50 million different million different million different vulnerabilities, why don't you come and vulnerabilities, why don't you come and vulnerabilities, why don't you come and consume the bomb and then you can match consume the bomb and then you can match consume the bomb and then you can match against the bomb and say, well, that's against the bomb and say, well, that's against the bomb and say, well, that's probably not true because they don't probably not true because they don't probably not true because they don't have this in the bomb and consume the have this in the bomb and consume the have this in the bomb and consume the bags and then you can say, well, and by bags and then you can say, well, and by bags and then you can say, well, and by the way, according to the VEX, they are the way, according to the VEX, they are the way, according to the VEX, they are not even affected or they are affected." not even affected or they are affected." not even affected or they are affected." Okay. So that will result in a lot more Okay. So that will result in a lot more Okay. So that will result in a lot more accurate scanning result and a better accurate scanning result and a better accurate scanning result and a better customer experience because customers customer experience because customers customer experience because customers can actually focus in chasing down the can actually focus in chasing down the can actually focus in chasing down the vulnerabilities that are relevant to vulnerabilities that are relevant to vulnerabilities that are relevant to their product and not chasing ghosts. Okay. Thank you. I knew that that would Okay. Thank you. I knew that that would Okay. Thank you. I knew that that would resonate with some people. Okay. Make my resonate with some people. Okay. Make my resonate with some people. Okay. Make my life easy. Security scanner vendor. Yes. life easy. Security scanner vendor. Yes. life easy. Security scanner vendor. Yes. Yes. We're we're trying just you know Yes. We're we're trying just you know Yes. We're we're trying just you know and and again you folks if you're and and again you folks if you're and and again you folks if you're customers for SC vendor you tell them go customers for SC vendor you tell them go customers for SC vendor you tell them go and talk to Cisco go and talk to Cisco and talk to Cisco go and talk to Cisco and talk to Cisco go and talk to Cisco they want to talk to you did you mention that only um public or did you mention that only um public or did you mention that only um public or open source CVS are in scope for CVR and open source CVS are in scope for CVR and open source CVS are in scope for CVR and not the Cisco CVS for now we are not the Cisco CVS for now we are not the Cisco CVS for now we are migrating traditional advisories that migrating traditional advisories that migrating traditional advisories that will be Cisco advisories to CBR. So will be Cisco advisories to CBR. So will be Cisco advisories to CBR. So you'll be able to get a VEX on a Cisco you'll be able to get a VEX on a Cisco you'll be able to get a VEX on a Cisco CV hopefully within the next six months. CV hopefully within the next six months. CV hopefully within the next six months. Okay. Hopefully, but you know how Okay. Hopefully, but you know how Okay. Hopefully, but you know how development is. All right. And it's development is. All right. And it's development is. All right. And it's going to remain free or going to remain free or going to remain free or the GUI access. Yes. Okay. See how the GUI access. Yes. Okay. See how the GUI access. Yes. Okay. See how careful I phrase that. careful I phrase that. careful I phrase that. Don't come complaining. Don't come complaining. Don't come complaining. Are are you looking for allies? uh to Are are you looking for allies? uh to Are are you looking for allies? uh to persuade that always the the tools persuade that always the the tools persuade that always the the tools vendors to uh consume VEX always we grab vendors to uh consume VEX always we grab vendors to uh consume VEX always we grab them and we'll beat them all together them and we'll beat them all together them and we'll beat them all together okay we we'll show them absolutely and okay we we'll show them absolutely and okay we we'll show them absolutely and you made the same question yes I mean you made the same question yes I mean you made the same question yes I mean you know it and I know it okay it will you know it and I know it okay it will you know it and I know it okay it will be a great value we think to our be a great value we think to our be a great value we think to our customers why is it not happen okay lawsuit Alberta um but Yes, happen okay lawsuit Alberta um but Yes, happen okay lawsuit Alberta um but Yes, it should happen. Absolutely. Let's talk. Let's happen. Absolutely. Let's talk. Let's happen. Absolutely. Let's talk. Let's talk. We If we have Oracle and we have talk. We If we have Oracle and we have talk. We If we have Oracle and we have Red Hat, we have Red Hat, we have Red Hat, we have to I I'm sorry. You've been delayed so to I I'm sorry. You've been delayed so to I I'm sorry. You've been delayed so long that I feel long that I feel long that I feel terrible. Yeah. Bros, who who who terrible. Yeah. Bros, who who who terrible. Yeah. Bros, who who who doesn't know you, Bros. Oh, I had a doesn't know you, Bros. Oh, I had a doesn't know you, Bros. Oh, I had a question about how this was um impacting question about how this was um impacting question about how this was um impacting Cisco internally. Um, so are you seeing Cisco internally. Um, so are you seeing Cisco internally. Um, so are you seeing like a decrease in the number of like like a decrease in the number of like like a decrease in the number of like vulnerability questions that your vulnerability questions that your vulnerability questions that your support's having to handle or are support's having to handle or are support's having to handle or are customers more going to this tool customers more going to this tool customers more going to this tool instead or are you still seeing that instead or are you still seeing that instead or are you still seeing that going through the support? going through the support? going through the support? Actually in some way it's always tricky Actually in some way it's always tricky Actually in some way it's always tricky right in some ways has improved our right in some ways has improved our right in some ways has improved our relationship with the development teams relationship with the development teams relationship with the development teams because when we come asking about the because when we come asking about the because when we come asking about the vulnerability is not because before it vulnerability is not because before it vulnerability is not because before it was like you're pulling that out of thin was like you're pulling that out of thin was like you're pulling that out of thin air. I'm not it's our customers. It's air. I'm not it's our customers. It's air. I'm not it's our customers. It's your customers that want to know. So in your customers that want to know. So in your customers that want to know. So in from that point of view has but from that point of view has but from that point of view has but development teams and I love all development teams and I love all development teams and I love all developers. I love puppies and rainbows developers. I love puppies and rainbows developers. I love puppies and rainbows and developers especially. But the truth and developers especially. But the truth and developers especially. But the truth is you know how they are okay once we is you know how they are okay once we is you know how they are okay once we they are happy because they say okay now they are happy because they say okay now they are happy because they say okay now you're asking me about what then you're asking me about what then you're asking me about what then immediately turns into oh but there are immediately turns into oh but there are immediately turns into oh but there are so many questions. Yeah that's the so many questions. Yeah that's the so many questions. Yeah that's the nature of the problem right? I mean you nature of the problem right? I mean you nature of the problem right? I mean you sell a product you should be able to sell a product you should be able to sell a product you should be able to handle the questions. just this answer. Uh so I have another question maybe Uh so I have another question maybe Uh so I have another question maybe far-fetched about kind of the your far-fetched about kind of the your far-fetched about kind of the your transition from printable to machine transition from printable to machine transition from printable to machine readable vulnerability information and readable vulnerability information and readable vulnerability information and uh it seems you make the split on kind uh it seems you make the split on kind uh it seems you make the split on kind of uh it's Cisco's fault first party CV of uh it's Cisco's fault first party CV of uh it's Cisco's fault first party CV versus it's somebody else's fault third versus it's somebody else's fault third versus it's somebody else's fault third party CV and my specific question is on party CV and my specific question is on party CV and my specific question is on really priorization of that because kind really priorization of that because kind really priorization of that because kind of every customer from from our of every customer from from our of every customer from from our perspective is really important in what perspective is really important in what perspective is really important in what is the risk EPSS CVs uh whatever is the risk EPSS CVs uh whatever is the risk EPSS CVs uh whatever standard is there but my assumption or standard is there but my assumption or standard is there but my assumption or kind of I would see want to see your kind of I would see want to see your kind of I would see want to see your assessment is that we say um if the assessment is that we say um if the assessment is that we say um if the vendor even made an advisory it must be vendor even made an advisory it must be vendor even made an advisory it must be important so will there be kind of important so will there be kind of important so will there be kind of advisories for important third party advisories for important third party advisories for important third party vulnerabilities or what do you think vulnerabilities or what do you think vulnerabilities or what do you think about they already are they already are about they already are they already are about they already are they already are for for the most critical NI we we have for for the most critical NI we we have for for the most critical NI we we have on the Cisco vulnerability policy we on the Cisco vulnerability policy we on the Cisco vulnerability policy we have a four four item criteria that we have a four four item criteria that we have a four four item criteria that we use to decide when are we going to do a use to decide when are we going to do a use to decide when are we going to do a full-blown on and it's the score has to full-blown on and it's the score has to full-blown on and it's the score has to be um um above 5.0. It has to have be um um above 5.0. It has to have be um um above 5.0. It has to have significant interest to our customer. It significant interest to our customer. It significant interest to our customer. It has to have demonstrated attacks etc etc has to have demonstrated attacks etc etc has to have demonstrated attacks etc etc etc. So for the most critical we did it etc. So for the most critical we did it etc. So for the most critical we did it for hardly. Okay. So for those kind of a for hardly. Okay. So for those kind of a for hardly. Okay. So for those kind of a scenarios we will do I'm I'm going to be scenarios we will do I'm I'm going to be scenarios we will do I'm I'm going to be very careful here because you see that very careful here because you see that very careful here because you see that you're asking me a question I'm telling you're asking me a question I'm telling you're asking me a question I'm telling you we are migrating the advisories to you we are migrating the advisories to you we are migrating the advisories to CVR. Okay. So my answer today is going CVR. Okay. So my answer today is going CVR. Okay. So my answer today is going to change in 6 months because if you're to change in 6 months because if you're to change in 6 months because if you're asking me are you doing an advisory for asking me are you doing an advisory for asking me are you doing an advisory for this you know high impactful DPS my this you know high impactful DPS my this you know high impactful DPS my answer may be like hey I'm yes on CBR go answer may be like hey I'm yes on CBR go answer may be like hey I'm yes on CBR go and get it from and get it from and get it from there okay I think that we have time for there okay I think that we have time for there okay I think that we have time for maybe one more question and if there is maybe one more question and if there is maybe one more question and if there is no question it's okay okay I mean it's no question it's okay okay I mean it's no question it's okay okay I mean it's we can all go for the break so one we can all go for the break so one we can all go for the break so one question um if you're migrating the question um if you're migrating the question um if you're migrating the security advisories to CVRs do you security advisories to CVRs do you security advisories to CVRs do you anticipate any um issues regarding um anticipate any um issues regarding um anticipate any um issues regarding um downloads and those that have systems downloads and those that have systems downloads and those that have systems that are kind of airgapped since you now that are kind of airgapped since you now that are kind of airgapped since you now require people to make the request require people to make the request require people to make the request directly to uh your platform. Um so let's think of governmental Um so let's think of governmental Um so let's think of governmental systems. Some of them don't like to systems. Some of them don't like to systems. Some of them don't like to upload their complete asset inventory to upload their complete asset inventory to upload their complete asset inventory to their vendors. So they basically prefer their vendors. So they basically prefer their vendors. So they basically prefer to grasp all the data that they have and to grasp all the data that they have and to grasp all the data that they have and uh evaluate it locally. But if you now uh evaluate it locally. But if you now uh evaluate it locally. But if you now need to ask all the questions through need to ask all the questions through need to ask all the questions through the API, um the question is is there the API, um the question is is there the API, um the question is is there still uh an download all in the API? That's a good question. Um and let me That's a good question. Um and let me That's a good question. Um and let me rephrase in a different or don't don't rephrase in a different or don't don't rephrase in a different or don't don't hate me, okay? because I'm I'm I'm kind hate me, okay? because I'm I'm I'm kind hate me, okay? because I'm I'm I'm kind of going to answer your question but not of going to answer your question but not of going to answer your question but not really. Very similar to the gentleman really. Very similar to the gentleman really. Very similar to the gentleman from Red Hat. Okay. What what I'm from Red Hat. Okay. What what I'm from Red Hat. Okay. What what I'm thinking now is there could be a use thinking now is there could be a use thinking now is there could be a use case scenario of taking all this case scenario of taking all this case scenario of taking all this information together and bundling them information together and bundling them information together and bundling them and making it available for download at and making it available for download at and making it available for download at software. So as an example when somebody software. So as an example when somebody software. So as an example when somebody has an art network they can take that has an art network they can take that has an art network they can take that and they can import it and just run with and they can import it and just run with and they can import it and just run with it. Okay just remember that a lot of it. Okay just remember that a lot of it. Okay just remember that a lot of this information is very much point in this information is very much point in this information is very much point in time. Okay. So the second that you time. Okay. So the second that you time. Okay. So the second that you download this is not like downloading download this is not like downloading download this is not like downloading from miter historical data and getting from miter historical data and getting from miter historical data and getting all CV ids and that basically set in a all CV ids and that basically set in a all CV ids and that basically set in a stone unless somebody augments that data stone unless somebody augments that data stone unless somebody augments that data this this assessment may change from one this this assessment may change from one this this assessment may change from one you know I mean if it's if it's you know I mean if it's if it's you know I mean if it's if it's vulnerable it's probably going to stay vulnerable it's probably going to stay vulnerable it's probably going to stay vulnerable if it's under investigation vulnerable if it's under investigation vulnerable if it's under investigation it's going to change so we good no more questions no more so we good no more questions no more so we good no more questions no more questions no more questions right okay questions no more questions right okay questions no more questions right okay thank you very much for having
