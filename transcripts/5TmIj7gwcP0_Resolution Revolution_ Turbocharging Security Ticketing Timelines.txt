Kind: captions Language: en Hi everyone, good afternoon. Thanks for Hi everyone, good afternoon. Thanks for Hi everyone, good afternoon. Thanks for coming to our talk today uh on coming to our talk today uh on coming to our talk today uh on resolution revolution turbocharging resolution revolution turbocharging resolution revolution turbocharging security ticketing timelines. Um we know security ticketing timelines. Um we know security ticketing timelines. Um we know that this is right after lunch and this that this is right after lunch and this that this is right after lunch and this is the last day so we hope we don't uh is the last day so we hope we don't uh is the last day so we hope we don't uh cause you to fall asleep. Um cause you to fall asleep. Um cause you to fall asleep. Um um with that being said a quick intro um with that being said a quick intro um with that being said a quick intro about ourselves. Uh I am Shrui data about ourselves. Uh I am Shrui data about ourselves. Uh I am Shrui data Gupta. I'm a product security engineer Gupta. I'm a product security engineer Gupta. I'm a product security engineer at Adobe. Uh I've been uh at Adobe for at Adobe. Uh I've been uh at Adobe for at Adobe. Uh I've been uh at Adobe for about four years now. Um and uh about four years now. Um and uh about four years now. Um and uh currently I am a part of the uh AI and currently I am a part of the uh AI and currently I am a part of the uh AI and data engineering team. And I'll hand it data engineering team. And I'll hand it data engineering team. And I'll hand it over to Joe to introduce himself. over to Joe to introduce himself. over to Joe to introduce himself. So I'm I'm Joe. Um I also am a product So I'm I'm Joe. Um I also am a product So I'm I'm Joe. Um I also am a product security AI and data engineer at Adobe. security AI and data engineer at Adobe. security AI and data engineer at Adobe. I've been there for about two years. Uh I've been there for about two years. Uh I've been there for about two years. Uh before that I spent about 13 years in before that I spent about 13 years in before that I spent about 13 years in the US intelligence community. If you the US intelligence community. If you the US intelligence community. If you want to talk more about that, we can want to talk more about that, we can want to talk more about that, we can talk after the presentation. So everyone at this presentation. So everyone at this presentation. So everyone at this conference has probably seen some conference has probably seen some conference has probably seen some variation on this slide multiple times variation on this slide multiple times variation on this slide multiple times and it'll be no surprise that the number and it'll be no surprise that the number and it'll be no surprise that the number of vulnerabilities are skyrocketing. of vulnerabilities are skyrocketing. of vulnerabilities are skyrocketing. Right? So this is through the end of Right? So this is through the end of Right? So this is through the end of 2024 and in 2025 we are on pace for you 2024 and in 2025 we are on pace for you 2024 and in 2025 we are on pace for you know if if they go at the rate they are know if if they go at the rate they are know if if they go at the rate they are maybe 40 maybe 40 maybe 40 50,000 and so this is you know about 50,000 and so this is you know about 50,000 and so this is you know about 1,000% increase in CVS since 2010 or 1,000% increase in CVS since 2010 or 1,000% increase in CVS since 2010 or about about about 360% increase since 2017 when there was 360% increase since 2017 when there was 360% increase since 2017 when there was a change in the way that CVS were a change in the way that CVS were a change in the way that CVS were tracked. So the reality is the same that we have So the reality is the same that we have So the reality is the same that we have these these these increasing CVEes. We have limited increasing CVEes. We have limited increasing CVEes. We have limited security security security resources and security t security teams resources and security t security teams resources and security t security teams are just a wash in are just a wash in are just a wash in tickets. We have tickets coming from bug tickets. We have tickets coming from bug tickets. We have tickets coming from bug bounty programs that are public or bounty programs that are public or bounty programs that are public or invite only. They can be of varying invite only. They can be of varying invite only. They can be of varying quality. We have internal pentest teams quality. We have internal pentest teams quality. We have internal pentest teams rendering tickets. We have external rendering tickets. We have external rendering tickets. We have external pentest teams. We have patching supply pentest teams. We have patching supply pentest teams. We have patching supply chain vulnerabilities just to name a chain vulnerabilities just to name a chain vulnerabilities just to name a few. few. few. And triaging and support can only go so And triaging and support can only go so And triaging and support can only go so far into what we can do. We have far into what we can do. We have far into what we can do. We have unmanageable deadlines. We have s uh we unmanageable deadlines. We have s uh we unmanageable deadlines. We have s uh we have SLAs that we can't have SLAs that we can't have SLAs that we can't meet and we have a high developer meet and we have a high developer meet and we have a high developer security ratio. Especially now we have security ratio. Especially now we have security ratio. Especially now we have increasingly amounts of code being increasingly amounts of code being increasingly amounts of code being created with less and less secure code created with less and less secure code created with less and less secure code and the same amount of and the same amount of and the same amount of developers or same amount of uh security developers or same amount of uh security developers or same amount of uh security staff and then staffing levels for cyber staff and then staffing levels for cyber staff and then staffing levels for cyber security and security researchers are security and security researchers are security and security researchers are not keeping pace with the amount of not keeping pace with the amount of not keeping pace with the amount of vulnerabilities that are showing up. vulnerabilities that are showing up. vulnerabilities that are showing up. I think there's been about a 60 or 70% I think there's been about a 60 or 70% I think there's been about a 60 or 70% increase in the amount of cyber security increase in the amount of cyber security increase in the amount of cyber security positions positions positions uh since 2017 whereas as we saw is about uh since 2017 whereas as we saw is about uh since 2017 whereas as we saw is about a a a 360% increase in the amount of 360% increase in the amount of 360% increase in the amount of vulnerabilities that have shown up and we also have knowledge up and we also have knowledge up and we also have knowledge challenges. So we have scattered challenges. So we have scattered challenges. So we have scattered communication about how to resolve communication about how to resolve communication about how to resolve vulnerability issues. This communication vulnerability issues. This communication vulnerability issues. This communication can take place in Slack channels in Jira can take place in Slack channels in Jira can take place in Slack channels in Jira tickets comments, git comments, tickets comments, git comments, tickets comments, git comments, in-person in-person in-person conversations, get comments, etc. And conversations, get comments, etc. And conversations, get comments, etc. And then we also have fragmented then we also have fragmented then we also have fragmented documentation about where this stuff documentation about where this stuff documentation about where this stuff lands. We have maybe a word doc that lands. We have maybe a word doc that lands. We have maybe a word doc that will explain how to fix something in a will explain how to fix something in a will explain how to fix something in a shared drive that this one guy knows shared drive that this one guy knows shared drive that this one guy knows about. We have things on wikis. We have about. We have things on wikis. We have about. We have things on wikis. We have documentation split between git and then documentation split between git and then documentation split between git and then somewhere else like public versus somewhere else like public versus somewhere else like public versus private info. We have documentation that private info. We have documentation that private info. We have documentation that doesn't exist. It's doesn't exist. It's doesn't exist. It's outdated. Then we have gaps in outdated. Then we have gaps in outdated. Then we have gaps in knowledge. Sometimes the information of knowledge. Sometimes the information of knowledge. Sometimes the information of the vulnerability is just not known the vulnerability is just not known the vulnerability is just not known about or we have varying levels of about or we have varying levels of about or we have varying levels of knowledge about it. So why do we care? So we we know it. So why do we care? So we we know it. So why do we care? So we we know that the impact of vulnerabilities is that the impact of vulnerabilities is that the impact of vulnerabilities is real. We know that vulnerabilities can real. We know that vulnerabilities can real. We know that vulnerabilities can make an impression on a company's make an impression on a company's make an impression on a company's reputation. They can have financial reputation. They can have financial reputation. They can have financial impact. They can have personal impact. They can have personal impact. They can have personal impacts and they can also have systemic, impacts and they can also have systemic, impacts and they can also have systemic, you know, we can um we care about the you know, we can um we care about the you know, we can um we care about the systemic risk that vulnerabilities pose systemic risk that vulnerabilities pose systemic risk that vulnerabilities pose to a to a to a company and we want to be able to use AI company and we want to be able to use AI company and we want to be able to use AI to help leverage and redistribute the to help leverage and redistribute the to help leverage and redistribute the bandwidth for our developers and our bandwidth for our developers and our bandwidth for our developers and our security security security staff. So this is the current scenario staff. So this is the current scenario staff. So this is the current scenario for us at least. We have a security for us at least. We have a security for us at least. We have a security engineer and we have a developer and engineer and we have a developer and engineer and we have a developer and these two have to work together to try these two have to work together to try these two have to work together to try to solve an issue. However, they have to solve an issue. However, they have to solve an issue. However, they have disperate realms of expertise. The disperate realms of expertise. The disperate realms of expertise. The security engineer has expertise on you security engineer has expertise on you security engineer has expertise on you know the exploit, the risk, the CVE, the know the exploit, the risk, the CVE, the know the exploit, the risk, the CVE, the CPE, whereas the developer has expertise CPE, whereas the developer has expertise CPE, whereas the developer has expertise on the code flow, the structure and how on the code flow, the structure and how on the code flow, the structure and how it works. And a lot of times there's not it works. And a lot of times there's not it works. And a lot of times there's not enough communication between the two, enough communication between the two, enough communication between the two, but they somehow have to reach the same but they somehow have to reach the same but they somehow have to reach the same goal where they fix a vulnerability. And so our thought was to vulnerability. And so our thought was to vulnerability. And so our thought was to be able to bring these two things be able to bring these two things be able to bring these two things together together together um using AI and then eventually using a um using AI and then eventually using a um using AI and then eventually using a unified knowledge base. So first a cautionary tale of the base. So first a cautionary tale of the base. So first a cautionary tale of the perils of AI and the hype. So in in perils of AI and the hype. So in in perils of AI and the hype. So in in about guess it was October of 23 about guess it was October of 23 about guess it was October of 23 um I started off doing what was AI code um I started off doing what was AI code um I started off doing what was AI code fixing and I thought it would take a few fixing and I thought it would take a few fixing and I thought it would take a few weeks just to show that it would work. weeks just to show that it would work. weeks just to show that it would work. So it starts off pretty easy. You'll see So it starts off pretty easy. You'll see So it starts off pretty easy. You'll see a lot of things you'll see a lot of a lot of things you'll see a lot of a lot of things you'll see a lot of demonstrations that have you know really demonstrations that have you know really demonstrations that have you know really simple dummy code and you can feed it to simple dummy code and you can feed it to simple dummy code and you can feed it to an AI and then it works. Uh the reality an AI and then it works. Uh the reality an AI and then it works. Uh the reality is a lot trickier. You have inconsistent is a lot trickier. You have inconsistent is a lot trickier. You have inconsistent output formats. you have just a problem output formats. you have just a problem output formats. you have just a problem of finding a training set. So, one of of finding a training set. So, one of of finding a training set. So, one of the big challenges is you don't often the big challenges is you don't often the big challenges is you don't often have when looking in the real world, you have when looking in the real world, you have when looking in the real world, you don't have the a real piece of code, you don't have the a real piece of code, you don't have the a real piece of code, you know, like a real like file of code know, like a real like file of code know, like a real like file of code that's hundreds of lines long with a that's hundreds of lines long with a that's hundreds of lines long with a labeled uh instance of of what the labeled uh instance of of what the labeled uh instance of of what the actual vulnerability is. Just finding actual vulnerability is. Just finding actual vulnerability is. Just finding that was that was that was tough. So, apart from that, we could do tough. So, apart from that, we could do tough. So, apart from that, we could do a couple different things. a couple different things. a couple different things. Um, and this whole point of this is we Um, and this whole point of this is we Um, and this whole point of this is we wanted to shift all the way left, as far wanted to shift all the way left, as far wanted to shift all the way left, as far as left as we could, and try to not only as left as we could, and try to not only as left as we could, and try to not only just basically find all the just basically find all the just basically find all the vulnerabilities we could that were vulnerabilities we could that were vulnerabilities we could that were existing in code and and just mitigate existing in code and and just mitigate existing in code and and just mitigate things from things from things from there. And we wanted to get to the level there. And we wanted to get to the level there. And we wanted to get to the level of uh automated pole level requests, of uh automated pole level requests, of uh automated pole level requests, pull level fixes. pull level fixes. pull level fixes. A few of the strategies that we tried to A few of the strategies that we tried to A few of the strategies that we tried to try to go this path was we would pull try to go this path was we would pull try to go this path was we would pull down entire repos and look for down entire repos and look for down entire repos and look for vulnerabilities in them using varying vulnerabilities in them using varying vulnerabilities in them using varying problem strategies. So the problem with problem strategies. So the problem with problem strategies. So the problem with that was if you're just pulling down that was if you're just pulling down that was if you're just pulling down repos you don't know what the repos you don't know what the repos you don't know what the vulnerabilities are and you have very vulnerabilities are and you have very vulnerabilities are and you have very few ways to actually um verify it few ways to actually um verify it few ways to actually um verify it without a huge manual investment. You without a huge manual investment. You without a huge manual investment. You could also do things like train a base could also do things like train a base could also do things like train a base model LLM uh model LLM uh model LLM uh with with examples of vulnerable code, with with examples of vulnerable code, with with examples of vulnerable code, but then you also have to do things like but then you also have to do things like but then you also have to do things like you have to have an established system you have to have an established system you have to have an established system where your your business is logging the where your your business is logging the where your your business is logging the vulnerabilities and then also tracking vulnerabilities and then also tracking vulnerabilities and then also tracking them in the pull request and you can go them in the pull request and you can go them in the pull request and you can go back and historically pull things and back and historically pull things and back and historically pull things and put together a training set that way. put together a training set that way. put together a training set that way. But the problem with that is you still But the problem with that is you still But the problem with that is you still have pieces of code you still have have pieces of code you still have have pieces of code you still have pieces of code that have vulnerable code pieces of code that have vulnerable code pieces of code that have vulnerable code in it despite that. So a lot of times in it despite that. So a lot of times in it despite that. So a lot of times the same file would show up uh across the same file would show up uh across the same file would show up uh across multiple different uh vulnerabilities multiple different uh vulnerabilities multiple different uh vulnerabilities and so your your training set is just and so your your training set is just and so your your training set is just not good. So despite all the hype um AI code good. So despite all the hype um AI code good. So despite all the hype um AI code fix just was not fix just was not fix just was not there. Can we do an exact code fix? there. Can we do an exact code fix? there. Can we do an exact code fix? Yeah, sometimes you can do it. Um it'd Yeah, sometimes you can do it. Um it'd Yeah, sometimes you can do it. Um it'd have to be a really simple example. For have to be a really simple example. For have to be a really simple example. For instance, if it's SQL injection or a instance, if it's SQL injection or a instance, if it's SQL injection or a oneliner oneliner oneliner um of cross-ite scripting, so many times um of cross-ite scripting, so many times um of cross-ite scripting, so many times the context of what you actually need is the context of what you actually need is the context of what you actually need is missing. You maybe your company only missing. You maybe your company only missing. You maybe your company only uses specific libraries to mitigate uses specific libraries to mitigate uses specific libraries to mitigate cross-ite scripting. Um you have complex logic. Anything that Um you have complex logic. Anything that Um you have complex logic. Anything that is flowing across multiple files or if is flowing across multiple files or if is flowing across multiple files or if it's dynamic is going to be extremely it's dynamic is going to be extremely it's dynamic is going to be extremely hard for uh for LM to pick up. And then hard for uh for LM to pick up. And then hard for uh for LM to pick up. And then the code alone was not enough. We found the code alone was not enough. We found the code alone was not enough. We found in reality is that developers and in reality is that developers and in reality is that developers and product teams they wanted something that product teams they wanted something that product teams they wanted something that was more robust. Even if they had the PR was more robust. Even if they had the PR was more robust. Even if they had the PR the pull request queued up for them they the pull request queued up for them they the pull request queued up for them they wanted some way to automate the process wanted some way to automate the process wanted some way to automate the process to make sure that what they were getting to make sure that what they were getting to make sure that what they were getting was good. And this kind of led to the insight that And this kind of led to the insight that And this kind of led to the insight that you still need humans in loop. So it wasn't a total failure. You loop. So it wasn't a total failure. You loop. So it wasn't a total failure. You know, we figured out some things that know, we figured out some things that know, we figured out some things that worked like advanced prompting worked like advanced prompting worked like advanced prompting techniques worked. So that would be if techniques worked. So that would be if techniques worked. So that would be if you have uh for instance chain of you have uh for instance chain of you have uh for instance chain of thought. So you provide an example of a thought. So you provide an example of a thought. So you provide an example of a you give a piece of vulnerable code, you you give a piece of vulnerable code, you you give a piece of vulnerable code, you give the fixed code and then you explain give the fixed code and then you explain give the fixed code and then you explain why that worked. why that worked. why that worked. We found that having quality We found that having quality We found that having quality measurements and logging was something measurements and logging was something measurements and logging was something that was a good takeaway. So that way that was a good takeaway. So that way that was a good takeaway. So that way you know how your uh techniques are you know how your uh techniques are you know how your uh techniques are performing. And finally the more context performing. And finally the more context performing. And finally the more context you could provide the better. So if you you could provide the better. So if you you could provide the better. So if you are providing things like the actual are providing things like the actual are providing things like the actual vulnerable code snippet ticket vulnerable code snippet ticket vulnerable code snippet ticket information from Jira link to a git file information from Jira link to a git file information from Jira link to a git file and metadata about the product then that and metadata about the product then that and metadata about the product then that would be really valuable. So we just shifted our valuable. So we just shifted our valuable. So we just shifted our approach. uh we talked to several approach. uh we talked to several approach. uh we talked to several internal customers. We talked to internal customers. We talked to internal customers. We talked to principal scientists, security leaders, principal scientists, security leaders, principal scientists, security leaders, product teams to see where they thought product teams to see where they thought product teams to see where they thought there was value in the workflow and some there was value in the workflow and some there was value in the workflow and some of the the takeaway was there was value of the the takeaway was there was value of the the takeaway was there was value that we could if we could integrate this that we could if we could integrate this that we could if we could integrate this knowledge with AI then we could give knowledge with AI then we could give knowledge with AI then we could give them solutions that they would need. But them solutions that they would need. But them solutions that they would need. But we also need need to have very tailored we also need need to have very tailored we also need need to have very tailored processes. We would need to have processes. We would need to have processes. We would need to have something that would be down to the something that would be down to the something that would be down to the product level and the vulnerability product level and the vulnerability product level and the vulnerability level to make these solutions actually level to make these solutions actually level to make these solutions actually work. And we also want to have some sort work. And we also want to have some sort work. And we also want to have some sort of proactive solutions. We want to be of proactive solutions. We want to be of proactive solutions. We want to be able to deploy something quickly so we able to deploy something quickly so we able to deploy something quickly so we could so we'd end up doing a um could so we'd end up doing a um could so we'd end up doing a um customize a micros service to make customize a micros service to make customize a micros service to make accurate security suggestions down to accurate security suggestions down to accurate security suggestions down to the product and type type of the product and type type of the product and type type of vulnerability. So this led us to this idea of having a So this led us to this idea of having a So this led us to this idea of having a unified knowledge base so that could unified knowledge base so that could unified knowledge base so that could merge the bug details, the code data and merge the bug details, the code data and merge the bug details, the code data and expert expert expert insights. And we wanted to access this insights. And we wanted to access this insights. And we wanted to access this via both Jira and Slack. And so these via both Jira and Slack. And so these via both Jira and Slack. And so these are a couple different use cases for are a couple different use cases for are a couple different use cases for Jira can um attract a different audience Jira can um attract a different audience Jira can um attract a different audience like someone that's more of a passive like someone that's more of a passive like someone that's more of a passive audience, someone who may take this audience, someone who may take this audience, someone who may take this information away and use it, but they information away and use it, but they information away and use it, but they are not actively going to seek it out. are not actively going to seek it out. are not actively going to seek it out. Whereas Slack is a channel where you can Whereas Slack is a channel where you can Whereas Slack is a channel where you can have someone interact with the data and have someone interact with the data and have someone interact with the data and really get more information that really get more information that really get more information that way. And again, the importance of this way. And again, the importance of this way. And again, the importance of this is having, you know, all this AI with a is having, you know, all this AI with a is having, you know, all this AI with a context. And we want to try to bring context. And we want to try to bring context. And we want to try to bring this uh domain expertise together too. this uh domain expertise together too. this uh domain expertise together too. So the AI the knowledge base has to have So the AI the knowledge base has to have So the AI the knowledge base has to have all the details of the of the product all the details of the of the product all the details of the of the product and all the details that could use to and all the details that could use to and all the details that could use to fix it. So our first capability that we started So our first capability that we started So our first capability that we started developing was a coder configuration developing was a coder configuration developing was a coder configuration fix. So in order to do this we needed to fix. So in order to do this we needed to fix. So in order to do this we needed to align our align our align our expectations do some uh expectation expectations do some uh expectation expectations do some uh expectation management. So we were no longer going management. So we were no longer going management. So we were no longer going to do a pull level request of a fix. we to do a pull level request of a fix. we to do a pull level request of a fix. we were going to do something that was more were going to do something that was more were going to do something that was more a more representative a more representative a more representative example because one of the reasons is example because one of the reasons is example because one of the reasons is all of the tickets coming in would have all of the tickets coming in would have all of the tickets coming in would have varying quality. You would have some varying quality. You would have some varying quality. You would have some tickets come in and they would have tickets come in and they would have tickets come in and they would have details down to the exact snippet of details down to the exact snippet of details down to the exact snippet of code that was vulnerable and then they code that was vulnerable and then they code that was vulnerable and then they would have um you know robust details would have um you know robust details would have um you know robust details about how you could actually perform about how you could actually perform about how you could actually perform this exploitation. Whereas others were this exploitation. Whereas others were this exploitation. Whereas others were just you know very unhelpful. they would just you know very unhelpful. they would just you know very unhelpful. they would just maybe have a few lines of a just maybe have a few lines of a just maybe have a few lines of a description, but you'd still be description, but you'd still be description, but you'd still be responsible for mitigating responsible for mitigating responsible for mitigating that. And so we decided we could just that. And so we decided we could just that. And so we decided we could just deliver a representative example that deliver a representative example that deliver a representative example that would just be like a generic uh instance would just be like a generic uh instance would just be like a generic uh instance of what this could look like if we have of what this could look like if we have of what this could look like if we have no other information. So we would take no other information. So we would take no other information. So we would take the information from the product. We the information from the product. We the information from the product. We would take the information about what would take the information about what would take the information about what type of vulnerability is and then use type of vulnerability is and then use type of vulnerability is and then use that as a step for the developer to that as a step for the developer to that as a step for the developer to fix. So this is what it looks like in fix. So this is what it looks like in fix. So this is what it looks like in practice. You have a security ticket practice. You have a security ticket practice. You have a security ticket that comes in. Uh you send a query to that comes in. Uh you send a query to that comes in. Uh you send a query to the AI the AI the AI orchestrator and then we use chain of orchestrator and then we use chain of orchestrator and then we use chain of thought thought thought prompting to pass that with the prompting to pass that with the prompting to pass that with the explanation and examples to explanation and examples to explanation and examples to AI and then the fixed recommendations AI and then the fixed recommendations AI and then the fixed recommendations return and that goes to back into the return and that goes to back into the return and that goes to back into the security ticket. And the same thing security ticket. And the same thing security ticket. And the same thing would apply if this were via Slack. would apply if this were via Slack. would apply if this were via Slack. So here's an example of what this looks So here's an example of what this looks So here's an example of what this looks like. So this would get pinned to a jer like. So this would get pinned to a jer like. So this would get pinned to a jer ticket or integrated into the ticket ticket or integrated into the ticket ticket or integrated into the ticket itself. And so first you have the reason itself. And so first you have the reason itself. And so first you have the reason for the code. Why is this why is this for the code. Why is this why is this for the code. Why is this why is this code code code vulnerable? And then you have either an vulnerable? And then you have either an vulnerable? And then you have either an example of the vulnerable code or you example of the vulnerable code or you example of the vulnerable code or you have a um representative snippet. So have a um representative snippet. So have a um representative snippet. So this this this says that this might look like whereas says that this might look like whereas says that this might look like whereas if the vulnerable code were actually in if the vulnerable code were actually in if the vulnerable code were actually in the ticket then it would show you the ticket then it would show you the ticket then it would show you that and then it would have an example that and then it would have an example that and then it would have an example of the fixed code. So here's what you of the fixed code. So here's what you of the fixed code. So here's what you might need to do to fix might need to do to fix might need to do to fix code and the reason why it should work. code and the reason why it should work. code and the reason why it should work. So this is also kind of a sanity check So this is also kind of a sanity check So this is also kind of a sanity check for the large language model as to you for the large language model as to you for the large language model as to you know is it giving you the right reason know is it giving you the right reason know is it giving you the right reason for the for the for the fix. The other capability that we fix. The other capability that we fix. The other capability that we integrated pretty quickly was finding an integrated pretty quickly was finding an integrated pretty quickly was finding an expert. So so many times we were people expert. So so many times we were people expert. So so many times we were people were tasked with solving a problem, were tasked with solving a problem, were tasked with solving a problem, they'd be assigned a ticket and they they'd be assigned a ticket and they they'd be assigned a ticket and they would have no idea where to turn, but would have no idea where to turn, but would have no idea where to turn, but usually someone has solved it usually someone has solved it usually someone has solved it before. And the goal is to reduce the before. And the goal is to reduce the before. And the goal is to reduce the wait time and allow people to wait time and allow people to wait time and allow people to collaborate quicker. And so for the expert finder, you'd have And so for the expert finder, you'd have And so for the expert finder, you'd have we had a process set up so that you have we had a process set up so that you have we had a process set up so that you have existing JR tickets and then you take existing JR tickets and then you take existing JR tickets and then you take the comments from the JRE tickets and the comments from the JRE tickets and the comments from the JRE tickets and you run an LLM over the comments to you run an LLM over the comments to you run an LLM over the comments to assign an expert to it. So a lot of assign an expert to it. So a lot of assign an expert to it. So a lot of times within the comment tracking of times within the comment tracking of times within the comment tracking of Jerry, you'd have someone would would Jerry, you'd have someone would would Jerry, you'd have someone would would filter up as the person who is the filter up as the person who is the filter up as the person who is the expert for this particular issue. expert for this particular issue. expert for this particular issue. So then you're passing that expert along So then you're passing that expert along So then you're passing that expert along with who who the expert is and the um with who who the expert is and the um with who who the expert is and the um the vectorzed version of the ticket to a the vectorzed version of the ticket to a the vectorzed version of the ticket to a vector vector vector database. So then when a new ticket database. So then when a new ticket database. So then when a new ticket comes in, you pass the content and the comes in, you pass the content and the comes in, you pass the content and the metadata to the AR metadata to the AR metadata to the AR orchestrator and then search for the orchestrator and then search for the orchestrator and then search for the similar tickets, return the most similar similar tickets, return the most similar similar tickets, return the most similar tickets and then rerank tickets and then rerank tickets and then rerank those and from there you can use varying those and from there you can use varying those and from there you can use varying methods to extract which which expert methods to extract which which expert methods to extract which which expert you want to use. So you could either say you want to use. So you could either say you want to use. So you could either say that you want to have the expert return that you want to have the expert return that you want to have the expert return who is most familiar with that specific who is most familiar with that specific who is most familiar with that specific ticket or you could say the expert who ticket or you could say the expert who ticket or you could say the expert who has maybe like solved three out of the has maybe like solved three out of the has maybe like solved three out of the 10 tickets. So then what's what this looks like in So then what's what this looks like in So then what's what this looks like in practice is you have again this is just practice is you have again this is just practice is you have again this is just pinned in a jer ticket is you have the pinned in a jer ticket is you have the pinned in a jer ticket is you have the subject matter expert and then why subject matter expert and then why subject matter expert and then why they're the they're the they're the expert and these are all things that expert and these are all things that expert and these are all things that this second capability this was this second capability this was this second capability this was something that was done in probably a something that was done in probably a something that was done in probably a week or so and um just one of the week or so and um just one of the week or so and um just one of the cautions is you may run into issues with cautions is you may run into issues with cautions is you may run into issues with your uh OGC because if sometimes if your uh OGC because if sometimes if your uh OGC because if sometimes if you're identifying you're identifying you're identifying people's names then that can be an issue people's names then that can be an issue people's names then that can be an issue and this is probably more pertinent to and this is probably more pertinent to and this is probably more pertinent to European operations in American right so um the next capability that we right so um the next capability that we right so um the next capability that we built was the best practices so so when built was the best practices so so when built was the best practices so so when we have a vulnerability that comes in we we have a vulnerability that comes in we we have a vulnerability that comes in we don't want to just tell the developer don't want to just tell the developer don't want to just tell the developer hey this is how you can go fix it but we hey this is how you can go fix it but we hey this is how you can go fix it but we also want to in a way educate them uh so also want to in a way educate them uh so also want to in a way educate them uh so that they can not just fix let's say one that they can not just fix let's say one that they can not just fix let's say one XSS uh vulnerability but understand what XSS uh vulnerability but understand what XSS uh vulnerability but understand what they can do to fix the class of uh XSS they can do to fix the class of uh XSS they can do to fix the class of uh XSS vulnerabilities right and again I think vulnerabilities right and again I think vulnerabilities right and again I think we talked about this earlier that uh we talked about this earlier that uh we talked about this earlier that uh traditionally in product security we traditionally in product security we traditionally in product security we manually provide uh security guidance uh manually provide uh security guidance uh manually provide uh security guidance uh but that does not scale very well so but that does not scale very well so but that does not scale very well so this capability is in a way to scale u this capability is in a way to scale u this capability is in a way to scale u best practice guidance and add that best practice guidance and add that best practice guidance and add that recommendation add that guidance to the recommendation add that guidance to the recommendation add that guidance to the ticket uh in addition to the ticket uh in addition to the ticket uh in addition to the fixes. Um again, yeah, so this is a way fixes. Um again, yeah, so this is a way fixes. Um again, yeah, so this is a way to kind of scale uh the manual security to kind of scale uh the manual security to kind of scale uh the manual security guidance. Um then this is also another guidance. Um then this is also another guidance. Um then this is also another way for us to add context, right? So for way for us to add context, right? So for way for us to add context, right? So for example, again with cross-ite scripting, example, again with cross-ite scripting, example, again with cross-ite scripting, if we have some approved libraries uh or if we have some approved libraries uh or if we have some approved libraries uh or let's say for secret management, we have let's say for secret management, we have let's say for secret management, we have some um some platform some secret some um some platform some secret some um some platform some secret management platform that we uh recommend management platform that we uh recommend management platform that we uh recommend to use within the company. This is a to use within the company. This is a to use within the company. This is a very good way for us to include that very good way for us to include that very good way for us to include that knowledge uh in the knowledge uh in the knowledge uh in the recommendation and uh how we built this recommendation and uh how we built this recommendation and uh how we built this was in a rag uh retrieval augmented was in a rag uh retrieval augmented was in a rag uh retrieval augmented generation based approach. Uh so I'll generation based approach. Uh so I'll generation based approach. Uh so I'll kind of walk you through more uh into kind of walk you through more uh into kind of walk you through more uh into that. Uh but uh one other benefit from that. Uh but uh one other benefit from that. Uh but uh one other benefit from this uh best practice guidance is that this uh best practice guidance is that this uh best practice guidance is that several times in large companies we have several times in large companies we have several times in large companies we have uh different platforms. For example, we uh different platforms. For example, we uh different platforms. For example, we we you can have like a different like a we you can have like a different like a we you can have like a different like a specific platform for identity and specific platform for identity and specific platform for identity and access management. So when you want to access management. So when you want to access management. So when you want to then include the best practice guidance then include the best practice guidance then include the best practice guidance that uh is that contains that context or that uh is that contains that context or that uh is that contains that context or information exactly about the platforms information exactly about the platforms information exactly about the platforms that you're using uh this again was a that you're using uh this again was a that you're using uh this again was a very good way to add that information. Um so so again like a very information. Um so so again like a very information. Um so so again like a very similar um workflow. we have the ticket similar um workflow. we have the ticket similar um workflow. we have the ticket uh that goes into the AI orchestrator. uh that goes into the AI orchestrator. uh that goes into the AI orchestrator. So here uh we introduce the concept of a So here uh we introduce the concept of a So here uh we introduce the concept of a vector database where we take all of our vector database where we take all of our vector database where we take all of our existing guidance uh be that be it existing guidance uh be that be it existing guidance uh be that be it security guidance, platform related security guidance, platform related security guidance, platform related guidance, all of our recommended guidance, all of our recommended guidance, all of our recommended libraries, text stack all of that. So we libraries, text stack all of that. So we libraries, text stack all of that. So we kind of curate that documentation that kind of curate that documentation that kind of curate that documentation that that knowledge base uh and then we use that knowledge base uh and then we use that knowledge base uh and then we use uh we uh use vector embedding. So we uh we uh use vector embedding. So we uh we uh use vector embedding. So we vectorize all of this knowledge base vectorize all of this knowledge base vectorize all of this knowledge base which is in natural language uh to a which is in natural language uh to a which is in natural language uh to a numerical vectorzed format that the numerical vectorzed format that the numerical vectorzed format that the models can understand uh then store that models can understand uh then store that models can understand uh then store that in the vector database. So then when a in the vector database. So then when a in the vector database. So then when a ticket comes in uh the orchestrator then ticket comes in uh the orchestrator then ticket comes in uh the orchestrator then searches the vector database uh finds searches the vector database uh finds searches the vector database uh finds out what uh does like a similarity out what uh does like a similarity out what uh does like a similarity semantic based search to retrieve all of semantic based search to retrieve all of semantic based search to retrieve all of the uh guidance that is related to uh the uh guidance that is related to uh the uh guidance that is related to uh the cross-ite scripting bug. um sends the cross-ite scripting bug. um sends the cross-ite scripting bug. um sends that sends that back along with the that sends that back along with the that sends that back along with the system prompt the model uh the model system prompt the model uh the model system prompt the model uh the model kind of summarizes all of that kind of summarizes all of that kind of summarizes all of that information and uh and then curates the information and uh and then curates the information and uh and then curates the output and sends it back uh to the output and sends it back uh to the output and sends it back uh to the ticket. So let's look at what that looks ticket. So let's look at what that looks ticket. So let's look at what that looks like. Um so so this is an example again like. Um so so this is an example again like. Um so so this is an example again we're taking cross-ite scripting uh as we're taking cross-ite scripting uh as we're taking cross-ite scripting uh as our example here. Um so we have the our example here. Um so we have the our example here. Um so we have the summary of the ticket what the summary of the ticket what the summary of the ticket what the vulnerability is what the CWE is uh and vulnerability is what the CWE is uh and vulnerability is what the CWE is uh and then you're providing Adobe specific then you're providing Adobe specific then you're providing Adobe specific recommendation. So this would be your recommendation. So this would be your recommendation. So this would be your company specific recommendation again uh company specific recommendation again uh company specific recommendation again uh what we are using a certain approved what we are using a certain approved what we are using a certain approved library for mitigating excss. So we say library for mitigating excss. So we say library for mitigating excss. So we say that this is what we recommend go use that this is what we recommend go use that this is what we recommend go use this. Um then we are giving you like this. Um then we are giving you like this. Um then we are giving you like short-term fixes right. So uh not just short-term fixes right. So uh not just short-term fixes right. So uh not just to again fix this particular bug but to again fix this particular bug but to again fix this particular bug but what can you do to fix this class of what can you do to fix this class of what can you do to fix this class of bugs um both short-term as well as bugs um both short-term as well as bugs um both short-term as well as long-term right so that is long-term long-term right so that is long-term long-term right so that is long-term fixes are more to like think about the fixes are more to like think about the fixes are more to like think about the class of problem uh in a systemic manner class of problem uh in a systemic manner class of problem uh in a systemic manner and think how you can uh kind of and think how you can uh kind of and think how you can uh kind of identify the root causes and fix them in identify the root causes and fix them in identify the root causes and fix them in a more systemic uh a more systemic uh a more systemic uh approach. Um so that was the best approach. Um so that was the best approach. Um so that was the best practices. uh our fourth capability is practices. uh our fourth capability is practices. uh our fourth capability is similar uh tickets. So one of the things similar uh tickets. So one of the things similar uh tickets. So one of the things that we found um as we worked with the that we found um as we worked with the that we found um as we worked with the vulnerability management team as well as vulnerability management team as well as vulnerability management team as well as product teams is that uh again it's like product teams is that uh again it's like product teams is that uh again it's like about adding context right so we have about adding context right so we have about adding context right so we have like over over the past so many years we like over over the past so many years we like over over the past so many years we have like some thousands of uh tickets have like some thousands of uh tickets have like some thousands of uh tickets and all of these tickets contain a lot and all of these tickets contain a lot and all of these tickets contain a lot of information right so how do we of information right so how do we of information right so how do we leverage that information again to leverage that information again to leverage that information again to provide uh more tailored guidance to the provide uh more tailored guidance to the provide uh more tailored guidance to the developer So this is very useful to uh developer So this is very useful to uh developer So this is very useful to uh find references uh reference tickets in find references uh reference tickets in find references uh reference tickets in the past. Uh let's say you're a new the past. Uh let's say you're a new the past. Uh let's say you're a new developer in the team, right? Uh you developer in the team, right? Uh you developer in the team, right? Uh you don't understand the code very well. don't understand the code very well. don't understand the code very well. You're still learning. Uh but if if You're still learning. Uh but if if You're still learning. Uh but if if there have been similar issues in the there have been similar issues in the there have been similar issues in the past and somebody from your team has past and somebody from your team has past and somebody from your team has already solved it, uh again expert already solved it, uh again expert already solved it, uh again expert finder is one way. But if you have finder is one way. But if you have finder is one way. But if you have references to past tickets, you can also references to past tickets, you can also references to past tickets, you can also look through that. Um then this also look through that. Um then this also look through that. Um then this also helps us find um like discover patterns helps us find um like discover patterns helps us find um like discover patterns right uh are we finding cross-ite right uh are we finding cross-ite right uh are we finding cross-ite scripting vulnerabilities point in time scripting vulnerabilities point in time scripting vulnerabilities point in time one or two here and there or do we have one or two here and there or do we have one or two here and there or do we have like tens of excss vulnerabilities that like tens of excss vulnerabilities that like tens of excss vulnerabilities that keep cropping up because if they do then keep cropping up because if they do then keep cropping up because if they do then that was more of a systemic issue. Um so that was more of a systemic issue. Um so that was more of a systemic issue. Um so this kind of helps you understand also this kind of helps you understand also this kind of helps you understand also what how your product is doing uh in what how your product is doing uh in what how your product is doing uh in terms of like what what is the security terms of like what what is the security terms of like what what is the security posture for that particular posture for that particular posture for that particular vulnerability looking like for your vulnerability looking like for your vulnerability looking like for your product. Um so here again a very similar product. Um so here again a very similar product. Um so here again a very similar workflow. Um we have the ticket um that workflow. Um we have the ticket um that workflow. Um we have the ticket um that comes in and just like the best practice comes in and just like the best practice comes in and just like the best practice guidance uh we followed a similar guidance uh we followed a similar guidance uh we followed a similar approach. We used all of our we had some approach. We used all of our we had some approach. We used all of our we had some 15 to 20,000 tickets. We vectorized all 15 to 20,000 tickets. We vectorized all 15 to 20,000 tickets. We vectorized all of them uh kind of stored them in the of them uh kind of stored them in the of them uh kind of stored them in the vector database. Uh so whenever a ticket vector database. Uh so whenever a ticket vector database. Uh so whenever a ticket comes in uh we search through the the comes in uh we search through the the comes in uh we search through the the vector DB retrieve the top similar vector DB retrieve the top similar vector DB retrieve the top similar tickets and then we also add added a tickets and then we also add added a tickets and then we also add added a re-ranking um a re-ranking logic over re-ranking um a re-ranking logic over re-ranking um a re-ranking logic over here to fine-tune the results uh the here to fine-tune the results uh the here to fine-tune the results uh the search results and make sure that the search results and make sure that the search results and make sure that the retrieved tickets the top similar retrieved tickets the top similar retrieved tickets the top similar tickets are as as close to like we reach tickets are as as close to like we reach tickets are as as close to like we reach a high accuracy with with the um a high accuracy with with the um a high accuracy with with the um retrieval. Um and then again kind of retrieval. Um and then again kind of retrieval. Um and then again kind of send that back uh and then uh kind of send that back uh and then uh kind of send that back uh and then uh kind of you get the model to read all of that you get the model to read all of that you get the model to read all of that information and uh build like some some information and uh build like some some information and uh build like some some trends in that trends in that trends in that data. Um so yeah this is an example um data. Um so yeah this is an example um data. Um so yeah this is an example um excesses that has been found in uh excesses that has been found in uh excesses that has been found in uh product X. Um and then we run the product X. Um and then we run the product X. Um and then we run the similarity search and then say hey we similarity search and then say hey we similarity search and then say hey we found 97 other tickets uh that are very found 97 other tickets uh that are very found 97 other tickets uh that are very similar to this ticket uh in the last 3 similar to this ticket uh in the last 3 similar to this ticket uh in the last 3 months. Um and then we uh we give months. Um and then we uh we give months. Um and then we uh we give references to what the top top three references to what the top top three references to what the top top three tickets are and then say okay what what tickets are and then say okay what what tickets are and then say okay what what is also the states statuses of these is also the states statuses of these is also the states statuses of these tickets right like um how many are in tickets right like um how many are in tickets right like um how many are in progress how many are blocked open um progress how many are blocked open um progress how many are blocked open um and then also the severity trends like and then also the severity trends like and then also the severity trends like out of all of these 97 tickets how many out of all of these 97 tickets how many out of all of these 97 tickets how many are high critical medium risk etc. So are high critical medium risk etc. So are high critical medium risk etc. So again, it kind of helps you understand again, it kind of helps you understand again, it kind of helps you understand what the overall um uh what the overall what the overall um uh what the overall what the overall um uh what the overall scenario is looking like with respect to scenario is looking like with respect to scenario is looking like with respect to this vulnerability in your this vulnerability in your this vulnerability in your product. So that was a lot of product. So that was a lot of product. So that was a lot of information about like what we did. Um information about like what we did. Um information about like what we did. Um so in addition to building all of these so in addition to building all of these so in addition to building all of these capabilities, we uh also thought about capabilities, we uh also thought about capabilities, we uh also thought about feedback and evaluations. again uh when feedback and evaluations. again uh when feedback and evaluations. again uh when we are building AI systems um evaluation we are building AI systems um evaluation we are building AI systems um evaluation uh testing uh is extremely critical and uh testing uh is extremely critical and uh testing uh is extremely critical and um I think um Joe touched upon this um I think um Joe touched upon this um I think um Joe touched upon this earlier that um having human in the loop earlier that um having human in the loop earlier that um having human in the loop human oversight is so important right so human oversight is so important right so human oversight is so important right so as we developed um developed the these as we developed um developed the these as we developed um developed the these capabilities we we talked a lot to the capabilities we we talked a lot to the capabilities we we talked a lot to the vulnerability management team as well as vulnerability management team as well as vulnerability management team as well as developers product teams continuously developers product teams continuously developers product teams continuously sought their feedback um to understand sought their feedback um to understand sought their feedback um to understand how useful these recommendations are for how useful these recommendations are for how useful these recommendations are for the developers. Um do they want more the developers. Um do they want more the developers. Um do they want more information? Do they want less information? Do they want less information? Do they want less information? Um are they are they information? Um are they are they information? Um are they are they finding it useful? Um so like uh or or finding it useful? Um so like uh or or finding it useful? Um so like uh or or for that matter like if we are adding for that matter like if we are adding for that matter like if we are adding these like all these recommendations in these like all these recommendations in these like all these recommendations in a certain uh like ticket queue, is that a certain uh like ticket queue, is that a certain uh like ticket queue, is that something that they're looking at? Uh so something that they're looking at? Uh so something that they're looking at? Uh so we learned a lot like along the way and we learned a lot like along the way and we learned a lot like along the way and uh we kind of iteratively improved on uh we kind of iteratively improved on uh we kind of iteratively improved on the basis of these uh human feedback uh the basis of these uh human feedback uh the basis of these uh human feedback uh uh that we received. Uh then comes model uh that we received. Uh then comes model uh that we received. Uh then comes model output evals. So, E evals or LLM evals output evals. So, E evals or LLM evals output evals. So, E evals or LLM evals is something that you might have come is something that you might have come is something that you might have come across, you might have heard. It refers across, you might have heard. It refers across, you might have heard. It refers to evaluating uh large language models to evaluating uh large language models to evaluating uh large language models or generative AI uh models outputs to or generative AI uh models outputs to or generative AI uh models outputs to ensure that uh they the generated ensure that uh they the generated ensure that uh they the generated content is uh aligning with what you content is uh aligning with what you content is uh aligning with what you want the model to generate, right? Um want the model to generate, right? Um want the model to generate, right? Um this also uh includes um mechanisms to this also uh includes um mechanisms to this also uh includes um mechanisms to ensure that uh your your output is again ensure that uh your your output is again ensure that uh your your output is again like um there's no data leakage in the like um there's no data leakage in the like um there's no data leakage in the model's outputs or the model is not model's outputs or the model is not model's outputs or the model is not hallucinating. Um it's kind of um yeah hallucinating. Um it's kind of um yeah hallucinating. Um it's kind of um yeah so those kinds of things come into the so those kinds of things come into the so those kinds of things come into the picture with uh output model output picture with uh output model output picture with uh output model output evals. Um and here we also included evals. Um and here we also included evals. Um and here we also included different kinds of metrics uh such as uh different kinds of metrics uh such as uh different kinds of metrics uh such as uh like hallucination is one um accuracy is like hallucination is one um accuracy is like hallucination is one um accuracy is one but then for example when we are one but then for example when we are one but then for example when we are talking about giving guidance on how to talking about giving guidance on how to talking about giving guidance on how to fix a vulnerability uh understandability fix a vulnerability uh understandability fix a vulnerability uh understandability is a metric like if if the if whatever is a metric like if if the if whatever is a metric like if if the if whatever actions we are uh kind of giving out to actions we are uh kind of giving out to actions we are uh kind of giving out to the developer are they able to the developer are they able to the developer are they able to understand it is it actionable right so understand it is it actionable right so understand it is it actionable right so those are also some of the metrics that those are also some of the metrics that those are also some of the metrics that we've used to evaluate how well um the we've used to evaluate how well um the we've used to evaluate how well um the recommendations uh are in terms of recommendations uh are in terms of recommendations uh are in terms of quality. Uh and yeah and like these quality. Uh and yeah and like these quality. Uh and yeah and like these approaches have kind of helped us uh approaches have kind of helped us uh approaches have kind of helped us uh kind of start small, iterate and kind of start small, iterate and kind of start small, iterate and continuously improve uh the quality of continuously improve uh the quality of continuously improve uh the quality of the recommendations. So uh with that uh recommendations. So uh with that uh recommendations. So uh with that uh we're kind of kind of reaching towards we're kind of kind of reaching towards we're kind of kind of reaching towards the end. Uh so our team has been the end. Uh so our team has been the end. Uh so our team has been developing these capabilities and many developing these capabilities and many developing these capabilities and many more in the um like generative AI space more in the um like generative AI space more in the um like generative AI space for security for like over a year and a for security for like over a year and a for security for like over a year and a half now and we've learned many things half now and we've learned many things half now and we've learned many things along the way and um I think it's along the way and um I think it's along the way and um I think it's worthwhile to share some of our worthwhile to share some of our worthwhile to share some of our learnings here with you. Um first of all learnings here with you. Um first of all learnings here with you. Um first of all like like like um we spent a lot of time assessing um we spent a lot of time assessing um we spent a lot of time assessing knowledge gaps. Um and this kind of ties knowledge gaps. Um and this kind of ties knowledge gaps. Um and this kind of ties back to what Joe was talking about back to what Joe was talking about back to what Joe was talking about earlier, right? like we have a lot of earlier, right? like we have a lot of earlier, right? like we have a lot of knowledge spread across the company in knowledge spread across the company in knowledge spread across the company in in Vicky's documentations in human in Vicky's documentations in human in Vicky's documentations in human experts but then there's like so much so experts but then there's like so much so experts but then there's like so much so many gaps right so what are those gaps many gaps right so what are those gaps many gaps right so what are those gaps what what what components of the what what what components of the what what what components of the knowledge do we need to be able to fix a knowledge do we need to be able to fix a knowledge do we need to be able to fix a vulnerability like understanding that vulnerability like understanding that vulnerability like understanding that ecosystem understanding how all of those ecosystem understanding how all of those ecosystem understanding how all of those pieces connect together uh was extremely pieces connect together uh was extremely pieces connect together uh was extremely important and we kind of uh learned this important and we kind of uh learned this important and we kind of uh learned this along the way and the more we spoke uh along the way and the more we spoke uh along the way and the more we spoke uh with developers, the more we spoke with with developers, the more we spoke with with developers, the more we spoke with uh the PER team, with the vulnerability uh the PER team, with the vulnerability uh the PER team, with the vulnerability management team, the more we learned and management team, the more we learned and management team, the more we learned and it helped us um curate what we were it helped us um curate what we were it helped us um curate what we were building uh to make sure that they were building uh to make sure that they were building uh to make sure that they were useful. Um secondly, why did this useful. Um secondly, why did this useful. Um secondly, why did this approach work for us? So again like we approach work for us? So again like we approach work for us? So again like we started building this towards the end of started building this towards the end of started building this towards the end of 2023 and at that time um like there was 2023 and at that time um like there was 2023 and at that time um like there was so much hype about AI and like there are so much hype about AI and like there are so much hype about AI and like there are so many vendors building very similar uh so many vendors building very similar uh so many vendors building very similar uh solutions right um but uh Adobe is a solutions right um but uh Adobe is a solutions right um but uh Adobe is a large company and extremely large company and extremely large company and extremely heterogeneous we have so many different heterogeneous we have so many different heterogeneous we have so many different products each product team works very products each product team works very products each product team works very very differently different tools texts very differently different tools texts very differently different tools texts operations everything is super different operations everything is super different operations everything is super different um so just uh like um a vendor solution um so just uh like um a vendor solution um so just uh like um a vendor solution off the shelf did not really work well off the shelf did not really work well off the shelf did not really work well for us, which is why uh we built this for us, which is why uh we built this for us, which is why uh we built this inhouse. Um if you're a smaller company, inhouse. Um if you're a smaller company, inhouse. Um if you're a smaller company, you might actually not need to do this you might actually not need to do this you might actually not need to do this for yourself. You might just get more for yourself. You might just get more for yourself. You might just get more value by um using a vendor value by um using a vendor value by um using a vendor solution. Uh this is a very crucial solution. Uh this is a very crucial solution. Uh this is a very crucial learning. Um so our capabilities are learning. Um so our capabilities are learning. Um so our capabilities are designed towards helping developers and designed towards helping developers and designed towards helping developers and security teams. But what we learned is security teams. But what we learned is security teams. But what we learned is that developers are a very very crucial that developers are a very very crucial that developers are a very very crucial part of product security. Um and I know part of product security. Um and I know part of product security. Um and I know there were other sessions earlier where there were other sessions earlier where there were other sessions earlier where u this topic has been touched upon. So u this topic has been touched upon. So u this topic has been touched upon. So understanding what developers need understanding what developers need understanding what developers need making security easy and accessible for making security easy and accessible for making security easy and accessible for them uh is very important them uh is very important them uh is very important because doing like building secure because doing like building secure because doing like building secure products is the right thing to do. Uh products is the right thing to do. Uh products is the right thing to do. Uh but developers are not incentivized for but developers are not incentivized for but developers are not incentivized for it. So if we help make it easier for it. So if we help make it easier for it. So if we help make it easier for them, they want to do the right thing. them, they want to do the right thing. them, they want to do the right thing. They want to ship secure products. So They want to ship secure products. So They want to ship secure products. So understanding uh empathizing with understanding uh empathizing with understanding uh empathizing with developers, understanding their pain developers, understanding their pain developers, understanding their pain points, understanding their workflows points, understanding their workflows points, understanding their workflows was uh was also very crucial for us. Uh was uh was also very crucial for us. Uh was uh was also very crucial for us. Uh it really helped us develop uh developer it really helped us develop uh developer it really helped us develop uh developer develop developer empathy. Um and uh and develop developer empathy. Um and uh and develop developer empathy. Um and uh and yeah like all the capabilities that that yeah like all the capabilities that that yeah like all the capabilities that that we built we made sure to integrate them we built we made sure to integrate them we built we made sure to integrate them embed them with existing developer embed them with existing developer embed them with existing developer workflow so that they don't have to come workflow so that they don't have to come workflow so that they don't have to come find the right guidance the guidance is find the right guidance the guidance is find the right guidance the guidance is there for them as and when they need there for them as and when they need there for them as and when they need it. Um and finally like this uh was this it. Um and finally like this uh was this it. Um and finally like this uh was this is like a new still evolving uh area of is like a new still evolving uh area of is like a new still evolving uh area of technology. We learned a lot by starting technology. We learned a lot by starting technology. We learned a lot by starting small, iterating, getting continuous small, iterating, getting continuous small, iterating, getting continuous feedback and then kind of scaling it feedback and then kind of scaling it feedback and then kind of scaling it from from from there. Uh so what can you take away from there. Uh so what can you take away from there. Uh so what can you take away from this session from our uh journey? First this session from our uh journey? First this session from our uh journey? First of all, uh AI is a very powerful tool to of all, uh AI is a very powerful tool to of all, uh AI is a very powerful tool to help reduce human toil. We have over help reduce human toil. We have over help reduce human toil. We have over over many years we've automated a lot of over many years we've automated a lot of over many years we've automated a lot of uh a lot of uh parts of the of security uh a lot of uh parts of the of security uh a lot of uh parts of the of security workflows. Uh but there are still workflows. Uh but there are still workflows. Uh but there are still aspects of different security workflows aspects of different security workflows aspects of different security workflows that are still manual and tedious. Uh that are still manual and tedious. Uh that are still manual and tedious. Uh and whenever there is a lot of data, a and whenever there is a lot of data, a and whenever there is a lot of data, a lot of um knowledge in natural language lot of um knowledge in natural language lot of um knowledge in natural language um AI as in large language models, um AI as in large language models, um AI as in large language models, generative AI in its current in their generative AI in its current in their generative AI in its current in their current capabilities are uh really current capabilities are uh really current capabilities are uh really really powerful u to kind of ease some really powerful u to kind of ease some really powerful u to kind of ease some of these workflows and reduce human of these workflows and reduce human of these workflows and reduce human toil. toil. toil. Um context uh is king. I know there's Um context uh is king. I know there's Um context uh is king. I know there's been a lot of discussions about context been a lot of discussions about context been a lot of discussions about context as well, right? Uh general purpose um as well, right? Uh general purpose um as well, right? Uh general purpose um models or general purpose LLMs can be models or general purpose LLMs can be models or general purpose LLMs can be curated and catered for your use case by curated and catered for your use case by curated and catered for your use case by adding the right context. Um, and we adding the right context. Um, and we adding the right context. Um, and we showed you many different examples of showed you many different examples of showed you many different examples of how we added more and more context to how we added more and more context to how we added more and more context to make sure that uh we have more control make sure that uh we have more control make sure that uh we have more control over what the models are doing, what over what the models are doing, what over what the models are doing, what outputs they're generating and at the outputs they're generating and at the outputs they're generating and at the same time tailoring u tailoring the same time tailoring u tailoring the same time tailoring u tailoring the models outputs for what what we need and models outputs for what what we need and models outputs for what what we need and our use our use our use cases. Uh yeah, like empowering teams cases. Uh yeah, like empowering teams cases. Uh yeah, like empowering teams security is a team sport. Um there is uh security is a team sport. Um there is uh security is a team sport. Um there is uh like the and as a part of the team sport like the and as a part of the team sport like the and as a part of the team sport like product engineering developers are like product engineering developers are like product engineering developers are an essential part of doing security an essential part of doing security an essential part of doing security right so like we learned along the way right so like we learned along the way right so like we learned along the way of how we can empower them how we can of how we can empower them how we can of how we can empower them how we can make security easier for them and this make security easier for them and this make security easier for them and this is uh I think one thing that I think we is uh I think one thing that I think we is uh I think one thing that I think we would encourage everybody to also think would encourage everybody to also think would encourage everybody to also think about uh how we can make security about uh how we can make security about uh how we can make security seamless accessible and easier um not seamless accessible and easier um not seamless accessible and easier um not just for security teams but also for just for security teams but also for just for security teams but also for engineering engineering engineering teams. Finally, you can build this too. teams. Finally, you can build this too. teams. Finally, you can build this too. Um u like our team was all security Um u like our team was all security Um u like our team was all security engineers. Uh none of us were AI engineers. Uh none of us were AI engineers. Uh none of us were AI engineers, but we learned along the way. engineers, but we learned along the way. engineers, but we learned along the way. Um and a a lot of the um like you can Um and a a lot of the um like you can Um and a a lot of the um like you can you can build uh the skill set around uh you can build uh the skill set around uh you can build uh the skill set around uh AI development. There are a lot of free AI development. There are a lot of free AI development. There are a lot of free and really high quality resources. Um so and really high quality resources. Um so and really high quality resources. Um so don't be shy if like AI is AI is not don't be shy if like AI is AI is not don't be shy if like AI is AI is not here to take our jobs. AI is here to here to take our jobs. AI is here to here to take our jobs. AI is here to help us uh make things easier for us. So help us uh make things easier for us. So help us uh make things easier for us. So go explore. I think there is a lot of go explore. I think there is a lot of go explore. I think there is a lot of opportunity um out there with AI. So uh opportunity um out there with AI. So uh opportunity um out there with AI. So uh with that um thank you so much for with that um thank you so much for with that um thank you so much for joining us and uh listening to our joining us and uh listening to our joining us and uh listening to our journey and uh hearing about our work. journey and uh hearing about our work. journey and uh hearing about our work. um please connect with us and uh I would um please connect with us and uh I would um please connect with us and uh I would also like to take this opportunity to also like to take this opportunity to also like to take this opportunity to actually thank our entire team um actually thank our entire team um actually thank our entire team um Adobee's product and software security Adobee's product and software security Adobee's product and software security AI and data engineering team uh like we AI and data engineering team uh like we AI and data engineering team uh like we have all been uh contributing and have all been uh contributing and have all been uh contributing and working on building all of these uh AI working on building all of these uh AI working on building all of these uh AI solutions and reimagining a lot of these solutions and reimagining a lot of these solutions and reimagining a lot of these product security workflows. So yeah with product security workflows. So yeah with product security workflows. So yeah with that thank you so much and we'll open that thank you so much and we'll open that thank you so much and we'll open the floor to questions. Thank you for that. Um, what uh are you Thank you for that. Um, what uh are you Thank you for that. Um, what uh are you able to share what technologies you used able to share what technologies you used able to share what technologies you used uh in your AI stack? uh in your AI stack? uh in your AI stack? Yeah, I I've been considering some of Yeah, I I've been considering some of Yeah, I I've been considering some of these same things and I counted about these same things and I counted about these same things and I counted about 15% of our presentations this week that 15% of our presentations this week that 15% of our presentations this week that had AI in the title. This one doesn't. had AI in the title. This one doesn't. had AI in the title. This one doesn't. So now we're up to 16 that cover the So now we're up to 16 that cover the So now we're up to 16 that cover the topic and a few other stealth ones in topic and a few other stealth ones in topic and a few other stealth ones in there. So um I've been communicating there. So um I've been communicating there. So um I've been communicating these things back to the team and just these things back to the team and just these things back to the team and just like to hear some insights on the stack like to hear some insights on the stack like to hear some insights on the stack if you're able to share that. Yeah. Yeah if you're able to share that. Yeah. Yeah if you're able to share that. Yeah. Yeah of course. And Joe add on if I miss of course. And Joe add on if I miss of course. And Joe add on if I miss anything. So we've basically been using anything. So we've basically been using anything. So we've basically been using uh models from Azure OpenAI. Uh again uh models from Azure OpenAI. Uh again uh models from Azure OpenAI. Uh again when we are building stuff um for a when we are building stuff um for a when we are building stuff um for a large company at an enterprise level you large company at an enterprise level you large company at an enterprise level you need to have uh you need to use uh need to have uh you need to use uh need to have uh you need to use uh trusted AI providers. So that was the trusted AI providers. So that was the trusted AI providers. So that was the route we went. Uh when it comes to the route we went. Uh when it comes to the route we went. Uh when it comes to the models themselves. Um in addition to models themselves. Um in addition to models themselves. Um in addition to that we have been using uh lang chain uh that we have been using uh lang chain uh that we have been using uh lang chain uh lang lang graph those are all uh like lang lang graph those are all uh like lang lang graph those are all uh like the platforms for building these the platforms for building these the platforms for building these solutions uh evaluating like platforms solutions uh evaluating like platforms solutions uh evaluating like platforms for evaluating uh logging uh monitoring for evaluating uh logging uh monitoring for evaluating uh logging uh monitoring the outputs. Um and then Lang graph is the outputs. Um and then Lang graph is the outputs. Um and then Lang graph is also the platform to build some of these also the platform to build some of these also the platform to build some of these uh agentic and graph related workflows. uh agentic and graph related workflows. uh agentic and graph related workflows. Those are the top ones. Am I the vector? Those are the top ones. Am I the vector? Those are the top ones. Am I the vector? Oh yes. And then we have uh yes we are Oh yes. And then we have uh yes we are Oh yes. And then we have uh yes we are uh using Pine cones uh vector uh vector uh using Pine cones uh vector uh vector uh using Pine cones uh vector uh vector databases um to do all of the vector databases um to do all of the vector databases um to do all of the vector search um uh aspects of the workflows. search um uh aspects of the workflows. search um uh aspects of the workflows. Yeah, that was a good one. Yeah, Yeah, that was a good one. Yeah, Yeah, that was a good one. Yeah, not sure if anybody was going to ask the not sure if anybody was going to ask the not sure if anybody was going to ask the question from Discord, so I'm going to question from Discord, so I'm going to question from Discord, so I'm going to ask it. Have you used this tool for SAS ask it. Have you used this tool for SAS ask it. Have you used this tool for SAS vulnerabilities or is it used only for vulnerabilities or is it used only for vulnerabilities or is it used only for SCA OSS and if used for SCA OSS and if used for SCA OSS and if used for SAS? Any learning examples from the SAS SAS? Any learning examples from the SAS SAS? Any learning examples from the SAS world? Yeah. So, so we we have world? Yeah. So, so we we have world? Yeah. So, so we we have experimented with this using this on experimented with this using this on experimented with this using this on SAS. So basically we would take the SAS. So basically we would take the SAS. So basically we would take the output of the Sarah file output of the Sarah file output of the Sarah file and run it you know with with the and run it you know with with the and run it you know with with the context of a lot of times it would have context of a lot of times it would have context of a lot of times it would have the code snippet and then you'd have the the code snippet and then you'd have the the code snippet and then you'd have the entire entire entire um you'd have the entire file like um you'd have the entire file like um you'd have the entire file like vulnerable code file and you'd have to vulnerable code file and you'd have to vulnerable code file and you'd have to pass it in. I think at the time that we pass it in. I think at the time that we pass it in. I think at the time that we tried to do this, we didn't have all of tried to do this, we didn't have all of tried to do this, we didn't have all of the other contextual information that we the other contextual information that we the other contextual information that we would need to make it an effective fix, would need to make it an effective fix, would need to make it an effective fix, but this is something that um yeah, we but this is something that um yeah, we but this is something that um yeah, we did explore this initially and I think did explore this initially and I think did explore this initially and I think there was some promise to it. Um it's there was some promise to it. Um it's there was some promise to it. Um it's definitely something to take advantage definitely something to take advantage definitely something to take advantage of if you have existing tools that do of if you have existing tools that do of if you have existing tools that do it. It's just another thing to add to it. It's just another thing to add to it. It's just another thing to add to your collection of tools. Yeah. And uh your collection of tools. Yeah. And uh your collection of tools. Yeah. And uh to add to that uh to add to that uh to add to that uh like our solutions are kind of an add-on like our solutions are kind of an add-on like our solutions are kind of an add-on to SAS tools because SAS uh SAS tools to SAS tools because SAS uh SAS tools to SAS tools because SAS uh SAS tools are finding the vulnerabilities. We are are finding the vulnerabilities. We are are finding the vulnerabilities. We are focusing more on the remediation aspect. focusing more on the remediation aspect. focusing more on the remediation aspect. So uh we are kind of working on So uh we are kind of working on So uh we are kind of working on integrating both of these workflows to integrating both of these workflows to integrating both of these workflows to kind of find vulnerabilities and then kind of find vulnerabilities and then kind of find vulnerabilities and then remediate them as well. Yeah. Uh do we remediate them as well. Yeah. Uh do we remediate them as well. Yeah. Uh do we have any more questions from Discord? have any more questions from Discord? have any more questions from Discord? That was okay. Thank you. Just some good That was okay. Thank you. Just some good That was okay. Thank you. Just some good comments, great presentation. Uh let's comments, great presentation. Uh let's comments, great presentation. Uh let's give it a round of applause for this give it a round of applause for this give it a round of applause for this presenters. presenters. presenters. Thank you so much for joining us today.
