Kind: captions Language: en My name is Alex Summers. I am MITER's My name is Alex Summers. I am MITER's My name is Alex Summers. I am MITER's CVE and CWE project lead. And I am CVE and CWE project lead. And I am CVE and CWE project lead. And I am really thrilled about this uh talk. It's really thrilled about this uh talk. It's really thrilled about this uh talk. It's about the enriched CVE record, about the enriched CVE record, about the enriched CVE record, redefining completeness and quality for redefining completeness and quality for redefining completeness and quality for greater impact. Key takeaways that I have for impact. Key takeaways that I have for impact. Key takeaways that I have for you for this talk is that CVE data you for this talk is that CVE data you for this talk is that CVE data enrichment is evolving. enrichment is evolving. enrichment is evolving. It has been evolving. It is evolving. It has been evolving. It is evolving. It has been evolving. It is evolving. Um and that in and of itself is Um and that in and of itself is Um and that in and of itself is redefining completeness in the redefining completeness in the redefining completeness in the ecosystem. There is active community ecosystem. There is active community ecosystem. There is active community participation and it's driving sustained participation and it's driving sustained participation and it's driving sustained improvement and adoption of more improvement and adoption of more improvement and adoption of more information being provided by the information being provided by the information being provided by the ecosystem. ecosystem. ecosystem. Um and really Um and really Um and really critical to everything is that complete, critical to everything is that complete, critical to everything is that complete, accurate and timely CVE records are accurate and timely CVE records are accurate and timely CVE records are critical to reducing cyber security risk critical to reducing cyber security risk critical to reducing cyber security risk uh and a safer global uh and a safer global uh and a safer global ecosystem. So just I don't want to go ecosystem. So just I don't want to go ecosystem. So just I don't want to go through tons and tons of history but I through tons and tons of history but I through tons and tons of history but I have some here. Um one of the things is have some here. Um one of the things is have some here. Um one of the things is that uh in 1999 a CBE record consisted that uh in 1999 a CBE record consisted that uh in 1999 a CBE record consisted of three elements. You had the of three elements. You had the of three elements. You had the ID, right? We're all familiar with that. ID, right? We're all familiar with that. ID, right? We're all familiar with that. You had a brief description. Buffer You had a brief description. Buffer You had a brief description. Buffer overflow and Unixware XA auto program overflow and Unixware XA auto program overflow and Unixware XA auto program allows local users to gain root allows local users to gain root allows local users to gain root privilege. And you had an external privilege. And you had an external privilege. And you had an external reference directing to further relevant reference directing to further relevant reference directing to further relevant information. This still remains as the information. This still remains as the information. This still remains as the required elements of a CVE record. And required elements of a CVE record. And required elements of a CVE record. And fun fact, you kind of got the sort of fun fact, you kind of got the sort of fun fact, you kind of got the sort of sneak ahead look. I didn't have my sneak ahead look. I didn't have my sneak ahead look. I didn't have my timing right. um they still actually timing right. um they still actually timing right. um they still actually have uh the same server running with all have uh the same server running with all have uh the same server running with all their uh 1999 advisories to this day in their uh 1999 advisories to this day in their uh 1999 advisories to this day in the original format. So that was CVE the original format. So that was CVE the original format. So that was CVE record completeness in 1999, 25 years record completeness in 1999, 25 years record completeness in 1999, 25 years ago. Um a lot has changed since then. ago. Um a lot has changed since then. ago. Um a lot has changed since then. There's vastly more software, vastly There's vastly more software, vastly There's vastly more software, vastly more complexity, more more complexity, more more complexity, more connectivity, more detection tools. connectivity, more detection tools. connectivity, more detection tools. um we have had and seen a proliferation um we have had and seen a proliferation um we have had and seen a proliferation of of of vulnerabilities and vulnerability vulnerabilities and vulnerability vulnerabilities and vulnerability management itself has grown more management itself has grown more management itself has grown more complicated. In addition to that, since complicated. In addition to that, since complicated. In addition to that, since 1999, we've had a lot of other standards 1999, we've had a lot of other standards 1999, we've had a lot of other standards evolve and grow and evolve and grow and evolve and grow and cultivate that have emerged for various cultivate that have emerged for various cultivate that have emerged for various purposes in managing vulnerabilities. purposes in managing vulnerabilities. purposes in managing vulnerabilities. And I know many in this room will can And I know many in this room will can And I know many in this room will can name several. Uh I'm going to talk about name several. Uh I'm going to talk about name several. Uh I'm going to talk about a few um but they're useful for a few um but they're useful for a few um but they're useful for different purposes. different purposes. different purposes. because they help in decision-m, they because they help in decision-m, they because they help in decision-m, they help in prioritization. They help in help in prioritization. They help in help in prioritization. They help in managing vulnerabilities uh in managing vulnerabilities uh in managing vulnerabilities uh in operations as to whether something's operations as to whether something's operations as to whether something's relevant to someone or relevant to someone or relevant to someone or not. They help in terms of understanding not. They help in terms of understanding not. They help in terms of understanding how severe a vulnerability may be how severe a vulnerability may be how severe a vulnerability may be depending on the context, right? How bad depending on the context, right? How bad depending on the context, right? How bad is it in general? Um and other is it in general? Um and other is it in general? Um and other characteristics. characteristics. characteristics. So historically in terms of enrichment So historically in terms of enrichment So historically in terms of enrichment one of the things that I mentioned one of the things that I mentioned one of the things that I mentioned before is a general notion of severity before is a general notion of severity before is a general notion of severity and what we had developed I forget the and what we had developed I forget the and what we had developed I forget the year I should probably reflected on this year I should probably reflected on this year I should probably reflected on this um but we've had CVSS and it's gone um but we've had CVSS and it's gone um but we've had CVSS and it's gone through several iterations the idea I through several iterations the idea I through several iterations the idea I put in quotes there around a general put in quotes there around a general put in quotes there around a general understanding for a standard around understanding for a standard around understanding for a standard around severity of vulnerabilities. We also had severity of vulnerabilities. We also had severity of vulnerabilities. We also had CWE which I'm more familiar with uh CWE which I'm more familiar with uh CWE which I'm more familiar with uh which came about literally out of the which came about literally out of the which came about literally out of the CVE program when it started to see we CVE program when it started to see we CVE program when it started to see we started to see data in the sense of started to see data in the sense of started to see data in the sense of similar things happening right different similar things happening right different similar things happening right different kinds kinds kinds of different kinds of similar of different kinds of similar of different kinds of similar vulnerabilities being disclosed in vulnerabilities being disclosed in vulnerabilities being disclosed in certain categories right so types of certain categories right so types of certain categories right so types of vulnerabilities is really the roots of vulnerabilities is really the roots of vulnerabilities is really the roots of where CWE became uh the definition of where CWE became uh the definition of where CWE became uh the definition of weaknesses and then also we had systems weaknesses and then also we had systems weaknesses and then also we had systems for identifying software naming software for identifying software naming software for identifying software naming software naming schemes for software of which naming schemes for software of which naming schemes for software of which there are several and there's actually there are several and there's actually there are several and there's actually going to be a panel discussion on this going to be a panel discussion on this going to be a panel discussion on this as well as other talks throughout this as well as other talks throughout this as well as other talks throughout this week that I hope you have time to go to week that I hope you have time to go to week that I hope you have time to go to uh myself included um touching on the uh myself included um touching on the uh myself included um touching on the challenge of software identification and challenge of software identification and challenge of software identification and the multi-identifier ecosystem that the multi-identifier ecosystem that the multi-identifier ecosystem that we're all enjoying these days um but we're all enjoying these days um but we're all enjoying these days um but also we've got lots of metadata around also we've got lots of metadata around also we've got lots of metadata around vulnerabilities that matter, right? Um, vulnerabilities that matter, right? Um, vulnerabilities that matter, right? Um, Kev's package URL, EPSS, a lot of things Kev's package URL, EPSS, a lot of things Kev's package URL, EPSS, a lot of things that bring value to management of that bring value to management of that bring value to management of vulnerabilities. And how this all worked vulnerabilities. And how this all worked vulnerabilities. And how this all worked historically, not everything existed, historically, not everything existed, historically, not everything existed, right, at different times, but we had right, at different times, but we had right, at different times, but we had the CVE database, we had a growing and the CVE database, we had a growing and the CVE database, we had a growing and still growing community of CVE records, still growing community of CVE records, still growing community of CVE records, sorry, excuse me, CNAs, right, sorry, excuse me, CNAs, right, sorry, excuse me, CNAs, right, generating CVE records. generating CVE records. generating CVE records. originally not, but let's say starting originally not, but let's say starting originally not, but let's say starting in 2016. And you'll note we've got all in 2016. And you'll note we've got all in 2016. And you'll note we've got all these CNAs depicted as little houses and these CNAs depicted as little houses and these CNAs depicted as little houses and bubbles uh for some reason. Um and what bubbles uh for some reason. Um and what bubbles uh for some reason. Um and what we started to see was that sometimes we started to see was that sometimes we started to see was that sometimes when these things came about, CNAs would when these things came about, CNAs would when these things came about, CNAs would enrich their records directly into the enrich their records directly into the enrich their records directly into the CVE program. So they would add a CVSS CVE program. So they would add a CVSS CVE program. So they would add a CVSS score when they decided within their score when they decided within their score when they decided within their operations this was important to them. operations this was important to them. operations this was important to them. wasn't required by the CVE program but wasn't required by the CVE program but wasn't required by the CVE program but um they wanted to do it for different um they wanted to do it for different um they wanted to do it for different number of reasons they might add CWEs number of reasons they might add CWEs number of reasons they might add CWEs right and that was consumed by uh well a right and that was consumed by uh well a right and that was consumed by uh well a variety of folks and we'll talk a little variety of folks and we'll talk a little variety of folks and we'll talk a little bit about that more in addition bit about that more in addition bit about that more in addition historically we had third parties where historically we had third parties where historically we had third parties where uh NVD for example would pull the CVE uh NVD for example would pull the CVE uh NVD for example would pull the CVE data in and using public information data in and using public information data in and using public information from advisories and other references and from advisories and other references and from advisories and other references and articles and all sorts of things make articles and all sorts of things make articles and all sorts of things make determinations for these things as they determinations for these things as they determinations for these things as they became value and were part valuable and became value and were part valuable and became value and were part valuable and were part of their mission space to say were part of their mission space to say were part of their mission space to say we're going to add CVSS information to we're going to add CVSS information to we're going to add CVSS information to all records. We are going to add CWE all records. We are going to add CWE all records. We are going to add CWE information to all records. We're going information to all records. We're going information to all records. We're going to add CPE information to all records. to add CPE information to all records. to add CPE information to all records. So suddenly we had this enriched So suddenly we had this enriched So suddenly we had this enriched information coming in as well from information coming in as well from information coming in as well from another place. another place. another place. And what this really has resulted in now And what this really has resulted in now And what this really has resulted in now is essentially the definition and is essentially the definition and is essentially the definition and uh manifestation of a new kind of uh manifestation of a new kind of uh manifestation of a new kind of completeness in the record. Right? completeness in the record. Right? completeness in the record. Right? Consumers are now expecting to see CVSS Consumers are now expecting to see CVSS Consumers are now expecting to see CVSS information. They're expecting to see information. They're expecting to see information. They're expecting to see C.WE information in a new kind of way. It's important to say too that way. It's important to say too that way. It's important to say too that generally speaking, the CVE program has generally speaking, the CVE program has generally speaking, the CVE program has evolved. One of the things that evolved. One of the things that evolved. One of the things that is I think why the program has been is I think why the program has been is I think why the program has been successful at least to the degree that successful at least to the degree that successful at least to the degree that it has and this is still true to this it has and this is still true to this it has and this is still true to this day is that it is consistently day is that it is consistently day is that it is consistently demonstrated an ability to evolve to demonstrated an ability to evolve to demonstrated an ability to evolve to bring greater value to the security bring greater value to the security bring greater value to the security community. Um, one of the things, case community. Um, one of the things, case community. Um, one of the things, case in point, I mentioned 2016. Prior to in point, I mentioned 2016. Prior to in point, I mentioned 2016. Prior to 2016, every single CVE record was 2016, every single CVE record was 2016, every single CVE record was written by the MITER Corporation. written by the MITER Corporation. written by the MITER Corporation. Sometimes in collaboration with uh other Sometimes in collaboration with uh other Sometimes in collaboration with uh other CNAs at the time there was, I'm looking CNAs at the time there was, I'm looking CNAs at the time there was, I'm looking at Chris 16 24 CNA, something like this. at Chris 16 24 CNA, something like this. at Chris 16 24 CNA, something like this. Um, but they were all written by the MIT Um, but they were all written by the MIT Um, but they were all written by the MIT corporation and a centralized model for corporation and a centralized model for corporation and a centralized model for vulnerability, identification, naming vulnerability, identification, naming vulnerability, identification, naming does not does not does not scale. And so the program uh through scale. And so the program uh through scale. And so the program uh through federation and the empowerment of more federation and the empowerment of more federation and the empowerment of more and more CNAs and more CNAs and more CNAs uh really was an experiment to see can uh really was an experiment to see can uh really was an experiment to see can this program scale can we grow adoption this program scale can we grow adoption this program scale can we grow adoption grow coverage of the program through grow coverage of the program through grow coverage of the program through federation and empowerment of an federation and empowerment of an federation and empowerment of an ecosystem a community of ecosystem a community of ecosystem a community of CNAs. So I mentioned in the last slide CNAs. So I mentioned in the last slide CNAs. So I mentioned in the last slide uh there's changing expectations now for uh there's changing expectations now for uh there's changing expectations now for what a complete record is. what a complete record is. what a complete record is. There's plenty of concerns on individual There's plenty of concerns on individual There's plenty of concerns on individual records, quality of records overall. But records, quality of records overall. But records, quality of records overall. But in general, if we talk about quality, a in general, if we talk about quality, a in general, if we talk about quality, a subset of quality being completeness, subset of quality being completeness, subset of quality being completeness, there is a new demand for that, right? there is a new demand for that, right? there is a new demand for that, right? There's an expectation that CVSS is part There's an expectation that CVSS is part There's an expectation that CVSS is part of a record, CWE is part of a record, of a record, CWE is part of a record, of a record, CWE is part of a record, uh, and software identity is becoming uh, and software identity is becoming uh, and software identity is becoming increasingly part of this. And there's increasingly part of this. And there's increasingly part of this. And there's different ways to to do that. different ways to to do that. different ways to to do that. Um a little bit about the CVE data Um a little bit about the CVE data Um a little bit about the CVE data format. Um it's developed by the format. Um it's developed by the format. Um it's developed by the community. Uh it was mentioned in this community. Uh it was mentioned in this community. Uh it was mentioned in this room. I forget which talk, but the room. I forget which talk, but the room. I forget which talk, but the quality working group. quality working group. quality working group. Um which is a community group that helps Um which is a community group that helps Um which is a community group that helps to develop and evolve the CVE record to develop and evolve the CVE record to develop and evolve the CVE record format. And over the last 25 years, the format. And over the last 25 years, the format. And over the last 25 years, the CVE program has evolved its record CVE program has evolved its record CVE program has evolved its record format several times. And really the format several times. And really the format several times. And really the main thing of it is that it has evolved main thing of it is that it has evolved main thing of it is that it has evolved into a structured format that allows into a structured format that allows into a structured format that allows specific data elements now to be added specific data elements now to be added specific data elements now to be added into the record by CNAs into the record by CNAs into the record by CNAs um at the time of um at the time of um at the time of disclosure. So the previous model like I disclosure. So the previous model like I disclosure. So the previous model like I said where some information was provided said where some information was provided said where some information was provided and then it was enriched by others and then it was enriched by others and then it was enriched by others uh isn't necessarily how things have to uh isn't necessarily how things have to uh isn't necessarily how things have to be. So as a result of the evolution in be. So as a result of the evolution in be. So as a result of the evolution in the record the record the record format, CNAs are capable and willing and format, CNAs are capable and willing and format, CNAs are capable and willing and we're going to talk more about that uh we're going to talk more about that uh we're going to talk more about that uh to provide this kind of enrichment to provide this kind of enrichment to provide this kind of enrichment information this new level of information this new level of information this new level of completeness at the time of disclosure completeness at the time of disclosure completeness at the time of disclosure rather than waiting right rather than uh rather than waiting right rather than uh rather than waiting right rather than uh waiting on downstream consumers to waiting on downstream consumers to waiting on downstream consumers to potentially add it let's uh with less potentially add it let's uh with less potentially add it let's uh with less information perhaps and more uh you know information perhaps and more uh you know information perhaps and more uh you know sort of you know time involved in the sort of you know time involved in the sort of you know time involved in the process. that can be added from the process. that can be added from the process. that can be added from the beginning. By the way, I do have a beginning. By the way, I do have a beginning. By the way, I do have a little reminder to myself. Be sure to little reminder to myself. Be sure to little reminder to myself. Be sure to attend uh Chris Coffin and Megazone's attend uh Chris Coffin and Megazone's attend uh Chris Coffin and Megazone's talk on the CVE record later this week. talk on the CVE record later this week. talk on the CVE record later this week. Um past, present, and future. Um it Um past, present, and future. Um it Um past, present, and future. Um it it'll be a good talk. I'm not I'm not it'll be a good talk. I'm not I'm not it'll be a good talk. I'm not I'm not going into a lot of the history. I just going into a lot of the history. I just going into a lot of the history. I just wanted to give a little general level wanted to give a little general level wanted to give a little general level setting. setting. setting. So what we started to see was So what we started to see was So what we started to see was that this new level of completeness that this new level of completeness that this new level of completeness expectation expectation expectation uh coincided also with community uh coincided also with community uh coincided also with community developed tooling for making CVE developed tooling for making CVE developed tooling for making CVE records. Many of you might be familiar records. Many of you might be familiar records. Many of you might be familiar with some of these clients. Many of you with some of these clients. Many of you with some of these clients. Many of you might use them. I gave an example uh might use them. I gave an example uh might use them. I gave an example uh vulnerogram um to drive or or to vulnerogram um to drive or or to vulnerogram um to drive or or to simplify and enable uh CNAs to provide simplify and enable uh CNAs to provide simplify and enable uh CNAs to provide and publish uh CVE records quickly and and publish uh CVE records quickly and and publish uh CVE records quickly and easily uh in a easily uh in a easily uh in a client. And so that tool also was one of client. And so that tool also was one of client. And so that tool also was one of the drivers in what we started to see the drivers in what we started to see the drivers in what we started to see with more and more CNAs providing this with more and more CNAs providing this with more and more CNAs providing this information as part of their records. Um information as part of their records. Um information as part of their records. Um and in addition to that in April and in addition to that in April and in addition to that in April actually few weeks from virtually a year actually few weeks from virtually a year actually few weeks from virtually a year ago um the CVE program kicked off an ago um the CVE program kicked off an ago um the CVE program kicked off an enrichment initiative where it literally enrichment initiative where it literally enrichment initiative where it literally called out as a call to action to the called out as a call to action to the called out as a call to action to the CNA community to say hey you can very CNA community to say hey you can very CNA community to say hey you can very easily provide this information and in easily provide this information and in easily provide this information and in fact you are best positioned to do it. fact you are best positioned to do it. fact you are best positioned to do it. You know your products better than You know your products better than You know your products better than anybody else. You have access to all the anybody else. You have access to all the anybody else. You have access to all the right data to make the correct right data to make the correct right data to make the correct determinations for CVS scores and CWEs determinations for CVS scores and CWEs determinations for CVS scores and CWEs and and other such enrichment and and other such enrichment and and other such enrichment information. You are the authoritative information. You are the authoritative information. You are the authoritative source of vulnerability information source of vulnerability information source of vulnerability information within your CNA scope. within your CNA scope. within your CNA scope. Um and in addition last year as well one Um and in addition last year as well one Um and in addition last year as well one of the things that was going on there of the things that was going on there of the things that was going on there was a lull in NVD enrichment and so was a lull in NVD enrichment and so was a lull in NVD enrichment and so there was a there was a demand from there was a there was a demand from there was a there was a demand from consumers and customers as I said that consumers and customers as I said that consumers and customers as I said that have grown accustomed to the idea of a have grown accustomed to the idea of a have grown accustomed to the idea of a new level of completeness um for this new level of completeness um for this new level of completeness um for this information information information and one of the things that was true and one of the things that was true and one of the things that was true about this announcement and sort of call about this announcement and sort of call about this announcement and sort of call to action to the community was an idea to action to the community was an idea to action to the community was an idea that really the program federation is that really the program federation is that really the program federation is continuing right and federation means continuing right and federation means continuing right and federation means empowering roots and CNAs with agency empowering roots and CNAs with agency empowering roots and CNAs with agency and respons responsibility and calling and respons responsibility and calling and respons responsibility and calling on them as best positioned and the uh on them as best positioned and the uh on them as best positioned and the uh and the requisite experts to provide and the requisite experts to provide and the requisite experts to provide this information to do so and um and you this information to do so and um and you this information to do so and um and you can do it in the in the record. So what can do it in the in the record. So what can do it in the in the record. So what we we we saw is is is some really exciting saw is is is some really exciting saw is is is some really exciting information which is that um and I I information which is that um and I I information which is that um and I I sort of did this in big chunks of like sort of did this in big chunks of like sort of did this in big chunks of like months at a time. We sort of look at months at a time. We sort of look at months at a time. We sort of look at this data in different chunks this data in different chunks this data in different chunks and I put a couple things here. There's and I put a couple things here. There's and I put a couple things here. There's a little yellow line with a little fancy a little yellow line with a little fancy a little yellow line with a little fancy bolt there. That's really indicating bolt there. That's really indicating bolt there. That's really indicating that just prior, so basically I think it that just prior, so basically I think it that just prior, so basically I think it was fall 2022. Hopefully I'm right about was fall 2022. Hopefully I'm right about was fall 2022. Hopefully I'm right about that. Um, Voligram, the the the client that. Um, Voligram, the the the client that. Um, Voligram, the the the client CVE record generating client that I CVE record generating client that I CVE record generating client that I mentioned added um made it easier for mentioned added um made it easier for mentioned added um made it easier for right CNAs to add enrichment information right CNAs to add enrichment information right CNAs to add enrichment information as part of their record. So we started as part of their record. So we started as part of their record. So we started to see right looking at active CNAs, to see right looking at active CNAs, to see right looking at active CNAs, CNAs that are publishing records within CNAs that are publishing records within CNAs that are publishing records within a data set time frame, right? How many a data set time frame, right? How many a data set time frame, right? How many were providing every one of their were providing every one of their were providing every one of their records with the CVSS score? How many records with the CVSS score? How many records with the CVSS score? How many were providing every one of their were providing every one of their were providing every one of their records uh with a C.WE and records uh with a C.WE and records uh with a C.WE and both. And and then at the bottom is a both. And and then at the bottom is a both. And and then at the bottom is a percentage. And basically what you can percentage. And basically what you can percentage. And basically what you can see is yes, it started right they were see is yes, it started right they were see is yes, it started right they were they were able to do it. I think Chris they were able to do it. I think Chris they were able to do it. I think Chris Madden on my last talk made a great Madden on my last talk made a great Madden on my last talk made a great point like if you make it easy for point like if you make it easy for point like if you make it easy for people to do the right thing, they will people to do the right thing, they will people to do the right thing, they will do the right thing and this is do the right thing and this is do the right thing and this is indicative of that. So we see more and indicative of that. So we see more and indicative of that. So we see more and more people adding this information over more people adding this information over more people adding this information over time. You can see in April 2024 last time. You can see in April 2024 last time. You can see in April 2024 last year, this enrichment initiative from year, this enrichment initiative from year, this enrichment initiative from the CVE program uh calling on CNAs to do the CVE program uh calling on CNAs to do the CVE program uh calling on CNAs to do more had a huge surge uh in that first more had a huge surge uh in that first more had a huge surge uh in that first window and now we're seeing more and window and now we're seeing more and window and now we're seeing more and more and the percentage of active CNAs more and the percentage of active CNAs more and the percentage of active CNAs with records in the data set of these with records in the data set of these with records in the data set of these timelines, right? Uh is timelines, right? Uh is timelines, right? Uh is increasing which is great and we want to increasing which is great and we want to increasing which is great and we want to see more of that. Um so I was thrilled see more of that. Um so I was thrilled see more of that. Um so I was thrilled to share that with you. One of the other to share that with you. One of the other to share that with you. One of the other things is that to recognize this and things is that to recognize this and things is that to recognize this and to encourage others to adopt a new level to encourage others to adopt a new level to encourage others to adopt a new level of completeness, a new sort of level of of completeness, a new sort of level of of completeness, a new sort of level of transparency and completeness in record transparency and completeness in record transparency and completeness in record production. Um the CVE program sort of production. Um the CVE program sort of production. Um the CVE program sort of came up with this idea of a recognition came up with this idea of a recognition came up with this idea of a recognition list which started in September. Uh this list which started in September. Uh this list which started in September. Uh this was basically uh intended to be uh was basically uh intended to be uh was basically uh intended to be uh criteria driven around what is valuable criteria driven around what is valuable criteria driven around what is valuable to the program in terms of completeness to the program in terms of completeness to the program in terms of completeness and quality and it was never meant to be and quality and it was never meant to be and quality and it was never meant to be a sort of set in stone set of criteria a sort of set in stone set of criteria a sort of set in stone set of criteria but it started in September with initial but it started in September with initial but it started in September with initial criteria around um CBSS and CWE criteria around um CBSS and CWE criteria around um CBSS and CWE information being provided as a matter information being provided as a matter information being provided as a matter of of of routine and what we started to see oh routine and what we started to see oh routine and what we started to see oh and and just to be clear so this is and and just to be clear so this is and and just to be clear so this is criteria for an enrichment recognition criteria for an enrichment recognition criteria for an enrichment recognition list. This was a first step along this list. This was a first step along this list. This was a first step along this process. It's possible and likely that process. It's possible and likely that process. It's possible and likely that the criteria will change as the CVE the criteria will change as the CVE the criteria will change as the CVE program works with its federated program works with its federated program works with its federated community to try and continue to drive community to try and continue to drive community to try and continue to drive changes in completeness, but not just changes in completeness, but not just changes in completeness, but not just completeness drive changes in quality completeness drive changes in quality completeness drive changes in quality too, right? changes in quality is one too, right? changes in quality is one too, right? changes in quality is one step further than complete and and step further than complete and and step further than complete and and that's also important and may be that's also important and may be that's also important and may be reflected in criteria for the ERL and reflected in criteria for the ERL and reflected in criteria for the ERL and also recognition that the the ERL may also recognition that the the ERL may also recognition that the the ERL may eventually become sort of more granular eventually become sort of more granular eventually become sort of more granular in terms of levels right or different in terms of levels right or different in terms of levels right or different kinds of organizations doing different kinds of organizations doing different kinds of organizations doing different kinds of things or different kinds of things or different kinds of things or different context. This is just a graph showing context. This is just a graph showing context. This is just a graph showing what we've seen in the ERL over time. what we've seen in the ERL over time. what we've seen in the ERL over time. Um, just calling attention to you guys. Um, just calling attention to you guys. Um, just calling attention to you guys. Uh, really at the end of the day, yes, Uh, really at the end of the day, yes, Uh, really at the end of the day, yes, it looks a little wonky and wobbly. Um, it looks a little wonky and wobbly. Um, it looks a little wonky and wobbly. Um, it's generally going up, right? We have it's generally going up, right? We have it's generally going up, right? We have more CNAs over time. We have more CNAs more CNAs over time. We have more CNAs more CNAs over time. We have more CNAs on the ERL as a percentage. It sort of on the ERL as a percentage. It sort of on the ERL as a percentage. It sort of ranges between, you know, low 70s going ranges between, you know, low 70s going ranges between, you know, low 70s going up to the upper uppers upper 70s. Um, up to the upper uppers upper 70s. Um, up to the upper uppers upper 70s. Um, but we're seeing more and more active but we're seeing more and more active but we're seeing more and more active CVE, excuse me, CNAs as well. So, a lot CVE, excuse me, CNAs as well. So, a lot CVE, excuse me, CNAs as well. So, a lot of these things uh come together. But of these things uh come together. But of these things uh come together. But the important point is that we're seeing the important point is that we're seeing the important point is that we're seeing more and more folks do this. Um, and more and more folks do this. Um, and more and more folks do this. Um, and we're going to keep tracking this and we're going to keep tracking this and we're going to keep tracking this and celebrating it. Uh, oh, by the way, I celebrating it. Uh, oh, by the way, I celebrating it. Uh, oh, by the way, I didn't mention this. The the list of of didn't mention this. The the list of of didn't mention this. The the list of of those that are on the the enrichment those that are on the the enrichment those that are on the the enrichment recognition list are published on the recognition list are published on the recognition list are published on the CVE website uh on a bi-weekly basis. So, CVE website uh on a bi-weekly basis. So, CVE website uh on a bi-weekly basis. So, um, and we want to do more probably um, and we want to do more probably um, and we want to do more probably around that, just showing some trends around that, just showing some trends around that, just showing some trends and and sort of other things, and and sort of other things, and and sort of other things, too. Um, and what's the impact of this? too. Um, and what's the impact of this? too. Um, and what's the impact of this? Because I think that's the most Because I think that's the most Because I think that's the most important thing as a takeaway. um and important thing as a takeaway. um and important thing as a takeaway. um and maybe it's not obvious. maybe it's not obvious. maybe it's not obvious. So providing enrichment at the time of So providing enrichment at the time of So providing enrichment at the time of disclosure really means more accurate disclosure really means more accurate disclosure really means more accurate and precise information is in the hands and precise information is in the hands and precise information is in the hands of defenders on a more timely basis. of defenders on a more timely basis. of defenders on a more timely basis. Right? So as I mentioned, we're not Right? So as I mentioned, we're not Right? So as I mentioned, we're not waiting for uh a record to be enriched waiting for uh a record to be enriched waiting for uh a record to be enriched by by someone else down the line. We're by by someone else down the line. We're by by someone else down the line. We're not waiting for that time. not waiting for that time. not waiting for that time. Um and it also strengthens the Um and it also strengthens the Um and it also strengthens the vulnerability management ecosystem and vulnerability management ecosystem and vulnerability management ecosystem and the entire cyber security community in the entire cyber security community in the entire cyber security community in better addressing risks. better addressing risks. better addressing risks. Um the value of Um the value of Um the value of these vulnerability metadata, these new these vulnerability metadata, these new these vulnerability metadata, these new systems are valuable for different systems are valuable for different systems are valuable for different reasons for prioritizing, right? Knowing reasons for prioritizing, right? Knowing reasons for prioritizing, right? Knowing something is actively exploited, right? something is actively exploited, right? something is actively exploited, right? Or or may likely be exploited, right? Or or may likely be exploited, right? Or or may likely be exploited, right? How severe something is, right? A lot of How severe something is, right? A lot of How severe something is, right? A lot of these new metadata is really valuable these new metadata is really valuable these new metadata is really valuable for different reasons. Uh and so when for different reasons. Uh and so when for different reasons. Uh and so when it's available um for different use it's available um for different use it's available um for different use cases, uh it really moves the needle for cases, uh it really moves the needle for cases, uh it really moves the needle for a lot of folks with different mission a lot of folks with different mission a lot of folks with different mission spaces. spaces. spaces. Um and I did want to just put there at Um and I did want to just put there at Um and I did want to just put there at the bottom, I know there's many the bottom, I know there's many the bottom, I know there's many represented in this room probably from represented in this room probably from represented in this room probably from various CNAs and if you are doing this, various CNAs and if you are doing this, various CNAs and if you are doing this, thank you. Um it's really it's really thank you. Um it's really it's really thank you. Um it's really it's really wonderful that you're doing that and um wonderful that you're doing that and um wonderful that you're doing that and um it's doing a lot to reduce cyber it's doing a lot to reduce cyber it's doing a lot to reduce cyber security risk. security risk. security risk. Uh, I also have a couple visuals that I Uh, I also have a couple visuals that I Uh, I also have a couple visuals that I thought might be helpful since I have thought might be helpful since I have thought might be helpful since I have the podium up here to just illustrate the podium up here to just illustrate the podium up here to just illustrate how this all works together. how this all works together. how this all works together. Um, the CVE program is a federated Um, the CVE program is a federated Um, the CVE program is a federated hierarchy. It's a rules-based hierarchy. It's a rules-based hierarchy. It's a rules-based program and it's a voluntary program. program and it's a voluntary program. program and it's a voluntary program. And so when we talk about And so when we talk about And so when we talk about people being asked to provide more people being asked to provide more people being asked to provide more information, right, being asked to information, right, being asked to information, right, being asked to provide enriched information, right, provide enriched information, right, provide enriched information, right, it's asking people to do more, right? it's asking people to do more, right? it's asking people to do more, right? And it's asking people to do more for And it's asking people to do more for And it's asking people to do more for themselves, but also for the community. themselves, but also for the community. themselves, but also for the community. And that's what's so valuable about all And that's what's so valuable about all And that's what's so valuable about all of this. Um, and really the CVE records of this. Um, and really the CVE records of this. Um, and really the CVE records are so central to so much of what cyber are so central to so much of what cyber are so central to so much of what cyber security in general is, right? I mean security in general is, right? I mean security in general is, right? I mean when we talk about CVE records, we talk when we talk about CVE records, we talk when we talk about CVE records, we talk about it that information being pulled about it that information being pulled about it that information being pulled down into national databases and down into national databases and down into national databases and advisories, tool vendors of all advisories, tool vendors of all advisories, tool vendors of all different kinds, right? Incident different kinds, right? Incident different kinds, right? Incident response operations, data scientists, response operations, data scientists, response operations, data scientists, researchers, polymakers, a lot of these researchers, polymakers, a lot of these researchers, polymakers, a lot of these folks folks folks have feedback and concerns, but um and have feedback and concerns, but um and have feedback and concerns, but um and they're and they're and they are all they're and they're and they are all they're and they're and they are all working to advance the program in new working to advance the program in new working to advance the program in new kinds of ways of value. and we work with kinds of ways of value. and we work with kinds of ways of value. and we work with all of them through working groups up all of them through working groups up all of them through working groups up right in the top right there. That is right in the top right there. That is right in the top right there. That is what really drives advancement here in what really drives advancement here in what really drives advancement here in addition to CNA action. So just wanted addition to CNA action. So just wanted addition to CNA action. So just wanted to throw that in there. And then I did to throw that in there. And then I did to throw that in there. And then I did another one that sort of like pulls it another one that sort of like pulls it another one that sort of like pulls it down a little bit further just showing down a little bit further just showing down a little bit further just showing like yeah if you look at national like yeah if you look at national like yeah if you look at national vulnerability databases and advisories vulnerability databases and advisories vulnerability databases and advisories and tool vendors all these different and tool vendors all these different and tool vendors all these different kinds of things um CBE records and kinds of things um CBE records and kinds of things um CBE records and what's in them is so directly impactful what's in them is so directly impactful what's in them is so directly impactful to so much of cyber security mission to so much of cyber security mission to so much of cyber security mission space. So, what's next? Um, CVE will continue So, what's next? Um, CVE will continue So, what's next? Um, CVE will continue to encourage and track enrichment to encourage and track enrichment to encourage and track enrichment activities. Um, we're going to be activities. Um, we're going to be activities. Um, we're going to be expanding communitydriven quality expanding communitydriven quality expanding communitydriven quality improvements. There's going to be a lot improvements. There's going to be a lot improvements. There's going to be a lot of different ways to do that. I know of different ways to do that. I know of different ways to do that. I know many in the community have ideas about many in the community have ideas about many in the community have ideas about that and we want to hear them and work that and we want to hear them and work that and we want to hear them and work with you to improve these things. with you to improve these things. with you to improve these things. Um the idea also is that as part of our Um the idea also is that as part of our Um the idea also is that as part of our federation and federation and federation and and encouragement and providing agency and encouragement and providing agency and encouragement and providing agency to roots right is that roots are to roots right is that roots are to roots right is that roots are responsible for a set of CNAs and so responsible for a set of CNAs and so responsible for a set of CNAs and so this information as far as the CNA's uh this information as far as the CNA's uh this information as far as the CNA's uh enrichment is concerned uh is going to enrichment is concerned uh is going to enrichment is concerned uh is going to be shared with roots such that they can be shared with roots such that they can be shared with roots such that they can create and and have conversations with create and and have conversations with create and and have conversations with CNAs in their respective purviews and CNAs in their respective purviews and CNAs in their respective purviews and talk about um maybe there's challenges talk about um maybe there's challenges talk about um maybe there's challenges in terms of doing different kinds of in terms of doing different kinds of in terms of doing different kinds of things in in having new levels of things in in having new levels of things in in having new levels of complete records or not. So that's complete records or not. So that's complete records or not. So that's something we're working towards and as I something we're working towards and as I something we're working towards and as I mentioned before the enrichment mentioned before the enrichment mentioned before the enrichment recognition list criteria may change recognition list criteria may change recognition list criteria may change over time as we sort of use it as a nice over time as we sort of use it as a nice over time as we sort of use it as a nice sort of encouraging uh recognition of sort of encouraging uh recognition of sort of encouraging uh recognition of those that are doing something that we those that are doing something that we those that are doing something that we want to drive the program towards right want to drive the program towards right want to drive the program towards right in terms of completeness and in terms of completeness and in terms of completeness and quality. Um and obviously everything quality. Um and obviously everything quality. Um and obviously everything that the CVE and CWE program does is that the CVE and CWE program does is that the CVE and CWE program does is driven by community engagement. We have driven by community engagement. We have driven by community engagement. We have a tremendous vast amount of community uh a tremendous vast amount of community uh a tremendous vast amount of community uh stakeholders that we want to work with stakeholders that we want to work with stakeholders that we want to work with and we do work with actively and working and we do work with actively and working and we do work with actively and working groups virtually every day of the week. groups virtually every day of the week. groups virtually every day of the week. Um and that's what we want to continue Um and that's what we want to continue Um and that's what we want to continue to do. to do. to do. So I have exhausted my slides and I know So I have exhausted my slides and I know So I have exhausted my slides and I know this is just after lunch and people are this is just after lunch and people are this is just after lunch and people are maybe just recovering from their maybe just recovering from their maybe just recovering from their uh their lunch uh consumption but this uh their lunch uh consumption but this uh their lunch uh consumption but this is the time for questions and I would is the time for questions and I would is the time for questions and I would love to hear your questions. Um, and I love to hear your questions. Um, and I love to hear your questions. Um, and I believe the best way to do it is to use believe the best way to do it is to use believe the best way to do it is to use a microphone which ah there is a a microphone which ah there is a a microphone which ah there is a microphone in the middle if you're microphone in the middle if you're microphone in the middle if you're willing to walk up because I would love willing to walk up because I would love willing to walk up because I would love I think there's a virtual audience too I think there's a virtual audience too I think there's a virtual audience too that would like to be able to hear your question. Thanks for the update. That question. Thanks for the update. That question. Thanks for the update. That was really cool. Um, what's MITER with was really cool. Um, what's MITER with was really cool. Um, what's MITER with its CNA as last resort hat on? How how's its CNA as last resort hat on? How how's its CNA as last resort hat on? How how's it performing against the ERL criteria it performing against the ERL criteria it performing against the ERL criteria at the moment? Not well, Bob. Um, the at the moment? Not well, Bob. Um, the at the moment? Not well, Bob. Um, the MITER MITER MITER CNALR has not been typically enriching CNALR has not been typically enriching CNALR has not been typically enriching CVE records and that is partially to do CVE records and that is partially to do CVE records and that is partially to do with the scope of the CNR and the with the scope of the CNR and the with the scope of the CNR and the information it's provided. So to answer information it's provided. So to answer information it's provided. So to answer your question, we are not enriching your question, we are not enriching your question, we are not enriching unless we have trusted uh how can I say unless we have trusted uh how can I say unless we have trusted uh how can I say information that is uh very trustworthy information that is uh very trustworthy information that is uh very trustworthy and and and um able to be included as part of the um able to be included as part of the um able to be included as part of the record. The CNLR is a CNR, excuse me, record. The CNLR is a CNR, excuse me, record. The CNLR is a CNR, excuse me, the CNA is last resort, right? The the CNA is last resort, right? The the CNA is last resort, right? The people that are coming to the CNR very people that are coming to the CNR very people that are coming to the CNR very often don't have the information of the often don't have the information of the often don't have the information of the product developer, for example. Um, and product developer, for example. Um, and product developer, for example. Um, and so as far as completeness goes with the so as far as completeness goes with the so as far as completeness goes with the CNALR, that's not something that CNALR, that's not something that CNALR, that's not something that historically it's done. What we're historically it's done. What we're historically it's done. What we're trying to do is find ways to incorporate trying to do is find ways to incorporate trying to do is find ways to incorporate that into our processes and also maybe that into our processes and also maybe that into our processes and also maybe to start requiring it of the researchers to start requiring it of the researchers to start requiring it of the researchers that are coming to the CNALR to come that are coming to the CNALR to come that are coming to the CNALR to come with that information. And I'll be with that information. And I'll be with that information. And I'll be honest, it's a bit of a balancing act as honest, it's a bit of a balancing act as honest, it's a bit of a balancing act as you can imagine because there's also the you can imagine because there's also the you can imagine because there's also the timeliness nature of wanting to get an timeliness nature of wanting to get an timeliness nature of wanting to get an ID for a vulnerability out and wanting ID for a vulnerability out and wanting ID for a vulnerability out and wanting to uh get quality information in that ID to uh get quality information in that ID to uh get quality information in that ID as well. So, thanks Alec. Yeah, I have a question for thanks Alec. Yeah, I have a question for thanks Alec. Yeah, I have a question for you. So you're saying you. So you're saying you. So you're saying that we've added all this new enriched that we've added all this new enriched that we've added all this new enriched data to the CVE records. data to the CVE records. data to the CVE records. So is there a difference with the So is there a difference with the So is there a difference with the information I can get from the NVD site information I can get from the NVD site information I can get from the NVD site versus the CVE versus the CVE versus the CVE website? What what what additional data website? What what what additional data website? What what what additional data can I get in each place or different can I get in each place or different can I get in each place or different data? data? data? Sure, that's a great question actually Sure, that's a great question actually Sure, that's a great question actually and one we get one we get a lot. where and one we get one we get a lot. where and one we get one we get a lot. where do I go to pull my do I go to pull my do I go to pull my data? I will start by clarifying a very data? I will start by clarifying a very data? I will start by clarifying a very common misconception in the community common misconception in the community common misconception in the community which is that these are the same thing which is that these are the same thing which is that these are the same thing or that CVE is NVD or that or that CVE is NVD or that or that CVE is NVD or that NVD makes CVE NVD makes CVE NVD makes CVE information or that MITER is NVD or that information or that MITER is NVD or that information or that MITER is NVD or that MITER is CVE alone. There's a lot of MITER is CVE alone. There's a lot of MITER is CVE alone. There's a lot of misconceptions around this. So but but misconceptions around this. So but but misconceptions around this. So but but more to the detail of your question more to the detail of your question more to the detail of your question um enrichment within the CVE record as I um enrichment within the CVE record as I um enrichment within the CVE record as I articulated and shown in the and I articulated and shown in the and I articulated and shown in the and I showed in the data is something that is showed in the data is something that is showed in the data is something that is new that is being done within the CVE new that is being done within the CVE new that is being done within the CVE record record record now and it was not being done within the now and it was not being done within the now and it was not being done within the CVE record CVE record CVE record itself going back in history right so itself going back in history right so itself going back in history right so 2010 there's a lot of enrichment 2010 there's a lot of enrichment 2010 there's a lot of enrichment information that lived in NVD for information that lived in NVD for information that lived in NVD for example and the enriched data is example and the enriched data is example and the enriched data is provided by the CNAs right yes and now provided by the CNAs right yes and now provided by the CNAs right yes and now in CVE enrichment information is in CVE enrichment information is in CVE enrichment information is provided by CNAs so for example in the provided by CNAs so for example in the provided by CNAs so for example in the current data set and going forward from current data set and going forward from current data set and going forward from now every day that we see new records now every day that we see new records now every day that we see new records come out that information is being come out that information is being come out that information is being provided by CNAs into the CVE record provided by CNAs into the CVE record provided by CNAs into the CVE record into the CVE into the CVE into the CVE list so a certain amount of historical list so a certain amount of historical list so a certain amount of historical data it's important to acknowledge is in data it's important to acknowledge is in data it's important to acknowledge is in NVD concerning those records Yeah, you mentioned criteria um the initial you mentioned criteria um the initial you mentioned criteria um the initial criteria. Mhm. Have there been any criteria. Mhm. Have there been any criteria. Mhm. Have there been any discussions around u expanding that and discussions around u expanding that and discussions around u expanding that and specifically to what kind of other specifically to what kind of other specifically to what kind of other criteria to enrich records in the criteria to enrich records in the criteria to enrich records in the future? What would be useful? What do future? What would be useful? What do future? What would be useful? What do people find useful? Yeah. So there has people find useful? Yeah. So there has people find useful? Yeah. So there has been discussions about it both in been discussions about it both in been discussions about it both in deciding what the initial criteria was deciding what the initial criteria was deciding what the initial criteria was going to be for that enrichment going to be for that enrichment going to be for that enrichment recognition list and also uh that it was recognition list and also uh that it was recognition list and also uh that it was not meant to be set and that's it right not meant to be set and that's it right not meant to be set and that's it right it's meant to be a living set of it's meant to be a living set of it's meant to be a living set of criteria. So criteria. So criteria. So um there's been discussions around the um there's been discussions around the um there's been discussions around the idea actually to be honest in some ways idea actually to be honest in some ways idea actually to be honest in some ways around around around volume that is to say if you have two volume that is to say if you have two volume that is to say if you have two records in the data set window few records in the data set window few records in the data set window few months versus 400 should you be held to months versus 400 should you be held to months versus 400 should you be held to the same you know sort of criteria for the same you know sort of criteria for the same you know sort of criteria for this recognition that's some discussions this recognition that's some discussions this recognition that's some discussions there's also discussions around there's also discussions around there's also discussions around completeness is now that we have the completeness is now that we have the completeness is now that we have the capability to support capability to support capability to support uh CPE information in the CVE record. uh CPE information in the CVE record. uh CPE information in the CVE record. Right? So that's something where it's Right? So that's something where it's Right? So that's something where it's like yeah maybe as PE as an like yeah maybe as PE as an like yeah maybe as PE as an encouragement for people to provide that encouragement for people to provide that encouragement for people to provide that information within their records. Uh information within their records. Uh information within their records. Uh this is one way to encourage that. this is one way to encourage that. this is one way to encourage that. Right? So CPE software identity is is is Right? So CPE software identity is is is Right? So CPE software identity is is is another one. Um but you can imagine any another one. Um but you can imagine any another one. Um but you can imagine any number of sort of vulnerability metadata number of sort of vulnerability metadata number of sort of vulnerability metadata being considered for part of what a being considered for part of what a being considered for part of what a complete and quality record might be. complete and quality record might be. complete and quality record might be. Uh, and really what the Uh, and really what the Uh, and really what the list is meant to be is not a punishing list is meant to be is not a punishing list is meant to be is not a punishing tool of saying you didn't do good tool of saying you didn't do good tool of saying you didn't do good enough. It's more striving and enough. It's more striving and enough. It's more striving and recognizing those that are doing certain recognizing those that are doing certain recognizing those that are doing certain things that are valuable to the things that are valuable to the things that are valuable to the community in terms of the data they're community in terms of the data they're community in terms of the data they're providing. providing. providing. Alec, so I looked at the list and like I Alec, so I looked at the list and like I Alec, so I looked at the list and like I I think the list is a good idea. You I think the list is a good idea. You I think the list is a good idea. You have 250 CNAs on that list. Less than have 250 CNAs on that list. Less than have 250 CNAs on that list. Less than 180 CNAs have published a CVE since you 180 CNAs have published a CVE since you 180 CNAs have published a CVE since you started the list. Is it just like once started the list. Is it just like once started the list. Is it just like once you're on you're on? No. No. It's you're on you're on? No. No. It's you're on you're on? No. No. It's actually run every bi-weekly and the actually run every bi-weekly and the actually run every bi-weekly and the data set is done within a window. That data set is done within a window. That data set is done within a window. That window must be pretty huge then, right? window must be pretty huge then, right? window must be pretty huge then, right? Uh it's within a four-week window of Uh it's within a four-week window of Uh it's within a four-week window of where your last record was. So we're where your last record was. So we're where your last record was. So we're trying to capture enrichment for those trying to capture enrichment for those trying to capture enrichment for those that are, for example, like I just that are, for example, like I just that are, for example, like I just mentioned, Microsoft has a ton of mentioned, Microsoft has a ton of mentioned, Microsoft has a ton of records all the time. Yeah. another CNA records all the time. Yeah. another CNA records all the time. Yeah. another CNA may not. But when they publish their may not. But when they publish their may not. But when they publish their record within the data set, so we're record within the data set, so we're record within the data set, so we're looking basically at a year, right? So, looking basically at a year, right? So, looking basically at a year, right? So, so if we look across a so if we look across a so if we look across a year, let's say somebody has four year, let's say somebody has four year, let's say somebody has four records in that year. Yeah. Right. So, records in that year. Yeah. Right. So, records in that year. Yeah. Right. So, and they're spread out, right? So, we and they're spread out, right? So, we and they're spread out, right? So, we are looking for completeness based on are looking for completeness based on are looking for completeness based on that criteria within the four weeks of that criteria within the four weeks of that criteria within the four weeks of their most recent record. Yeah. But their most recent record. Yeah. But their most recent record. Yeah. But there are there are CNAs on the list there are there are CNAs on the list there are there are CNAs on the list that have zero that have not had a that have zero that have not had a that have zero that have not had a record in that data set. Yes. Yeah. that record in that data set. Yes. Yeah. that record in that data set. Yes. Yeah. that are on the list. Do they just do they are on the list. Do they just do they are on the list. Do they just do they just never fall off? No, there should just never fall off? No, there should just never fall off? No, there should not be anybody on the list not be anybody on the list not be anybody on the list who has not had a record at all. who has not had a record at all. who has not had a record at all. Sorry. The the ERL list, the list of 250 Sorry. The the ERL list, the list of 250 Sorry. The the ERL list, the list of 250 CNAs, right? I don't know what the CNAs, right? I don't know what the CNAs, right? I don't know what the number is right now, but it's 250. I I number is right now, but it's 250. I I number is right now, but it's 250. I I looked because I cross referenced them looked because I cross referenced them looked because I cross referenced them and there's only 180 CNAs in the last and there's only 180 CNAs in the last and there's only 180 CNAs in the last year that have published a record. year that have published a record. year that have published a record. So that means there are 70 on the list So that means there are 70 on the list So that means there are 70 on the list at a minimum that don't have a CVE at a minimum that don't have a CVE at a minimum that don't have a CVE published in the last 12 months. That is published in the last 12 months. That is published in the last 12 months. That is a discrepancy that I cannot speak to a discrepancy that I cannot speak to a discrepancy that I cannot speak to because that should not be the case. because that should not be the case. because that should not be the case. Yeah. I I was just wondering because Yeah. I I was just wondering because Yeah. I I was just wondering because like 250 out of the like 250 out of the like 250 out of the 356 CNAs that are on the list, there's 356 CNAs that are on the list, there's 356 CNAs that are on the list, there's nearly every CNA, especially if you take nearly every CNA, especially if you take nearly every CNA, especially if you take out of the 81 that was in the last board out of the 81 that was in the last board out of the 81 that was in the last board meetings that haven't published any CVE. meetings that haven't published any CVE. meetings that haven't published any CVE. There's a set there's a set of CNAs that There's a set there's a set of CNAs that There's a set there's a set of CNAs that for example are not active in the sense for example are not active in the sense for example are not active in the sense that they don't have a record published that they don't have a record published that they don't have a record published in the data set. But what you're telling in the data set. But what you're telling in the data set. But what you're telling me is that there's some on the list. me is that there's some on the list. me is that there's some on the list. You're asserting that within the list You're asserting that within the list You're asserting that within the list for recently there's some on there that for recently there's some on there that for recently there's some on there that did not have a record in the last year. did not have a record in the last year. did not have a record in the last year. That's Yeah, in the last 12 months That's Yeah, in the last 12 months That's Yeah, in the last 12 months because I just went to April 2024 from because I just went to April 2024 from because I just went to April 2024 from your slide and just said how many CNAs your slide and just said how many CNAs your slide and just said how many CNAs are there? Yeah, I I mean I would be are there? Yeah, I I mean I would be are there? Yeah, I I mean I would be happy to follow up with you on this happy to follow up with you on this happy to follow up with you on this because we have the data for it. So if because we have the data for it. So if because we have the data for it. So if there's a problem in terms of what's there's a problem in terms of what's there's a problem in terms of what's being listed, okay, I I want to follow being listed, okay, I I want to follow being listed, okay, I I want to follow up and correct it. Yeah. Would you would up and correct it. Yeah. Would you would up and correct it. Yeah. Would you would you ever think about shrinking down that you ever think about shrinking down that you ever think about shrinking down that list? So it's in the last month or list? So it's in the last month or list? So it's in the last month or whatever. So So that award is more of a whatever. So So that award is more of a whatever. So So that award is more of a Yeah. To be clear, Yeah. To be clear, Yeah. To be clear, um we are open and we I'm speaking I um we are open and we I'm speaking I um we are open and we I'm speaking I mean this is a list criteria that was mean this is a list criteria that was mean this is a list criteria that was developed as part of the CVE program as developed as part of the CVE program as developed as part of the CVE program as a collective, right? Um in terms of a collective, right? Um in terms of a collective, right? Um in terms of changing the criteria for the ERL. Yes. changing the criteria for the ERL. Yes. changing the criteria for the ERL. Yes. like like as far as making it a better like like as far as making it a better like like as far as making it a better more useful list. Absolutely. Right. And more useful list. Absolutely. Right. And more useful list. Absolutely. Right. And that could go doing it less often like that could go doing it less often like that could go doing it less often like checking you know and only publishing it checking you know and only publishing it checking you know and only publishing it every quarter every month or something every quarter every month or something every quarter every month or something you know changing the criteria what is you know changing the criteria what is you know changing the criteria what is the amount right the the granularity of the amount right the the granularity of the amount right the the granularity of how much of CWES in your records you how much of CWES in your records you how much of CWES in your records you need to provide is there other data you need to provide is there other data you need to provide is there other data you need to provide all those things are need to provide all those things are need to provide all those things are considerations. Yeah. Thank you. Hi. Um so in a lot of our vulnerability Hi. Um so in a lot of our vulnerability Hi. Um so in a lot of our vulnerability analysis um where we use a lot of say analysis um where we use a lot of say analysis um where we use a lot of say dependency track we're seeing an dependency track we're seeing an dependency track we're seeing an everinccreasing you know severity everinccreasing you know severity everinccreasing you know severity unassigned and I'm just curious if this unassigned and I'm just curious if this unassigned and I'm just curious if this you know that coming maybe primarily you know that coming maybe primarily you know that coming maybe primarily from NVD if it's just pure again purely from NVD if it's just pure again purely from NVD if it's just pure again purely the backlog or could also the erl stuff the backlog or could also the erl stuff the backlog or could also the erl stuff maybe be factoring into to maybe be factoring into to maybe be factoring into to re-evaluations or modifications that's re-evaluations or modifications that's re-evaluations or modifications that's then leading to that. So, sorry, just to then leading to that. So, sorry, just to then leading to that. So, sorry, just to make sure I understand your question. make sure I understand your question. make sure I understand your question. You're you're saying that a lot of You're you're saying that a lot of You're you're saying that a lot of vulnerabilities you're responding to do vulnerabilities you're responding to do vulnerabilities you're responding to do not have which data? It's it's an not have which data? It's it's an not have which data? It's it's an unassigned severity. Unassigned unassigned severity. Unassigned unassigned severity. Unassigned severity. So, there's no CVSs scores. severity. So, there's no CVSs scores. severity. So, there's no CVSs scores. Correct. Right. Got it. So, but it just Correct. Right. Got it. So, but it just Correct. Right. Got it. So, but it just seems to be an everinccreasing I mean seems to be an everinccreasing I mean seems to be an everinccreasing I mean and I don't know maybe it's just purely and I don't know maybe it's just purely and I don't know maybe it's just purely the backlog is just the everinccreasing the backlog is just the everinccreasing the backlog is just the everinccreasing or or just the lull and it depends. It or or just the lull and it depends. It or or just the lull and it depends. It there's potentially a lot of context there's potentially a lot of context there's potentially a lot of context around that. Um, I'm actually curious around that. Um, I'm actually curious around that. Um, I'm actually curious because I do know that there are CNAs, because I do know that there are CNAs, because I do know that there are CNAs, for example, and participants in the CVE for example, and participants in the CVE for example, and participants in the CVE program that are not providing CVESS program that are not providing CVESS program that are not providing CVESS records, excuse me, scores. Um, and in records, excuse me, scores. Um, and in records, excuse me, scores. Um, and in some cases, part of that is because it some cases, part of that is because it some cases, part of that is because it depends on the context. And I think one depends on the context. And I think one depends on the context. And I think one of the things that folks have um against of the things that folks have um against of the things that folks have um against CVSS, at least in terms of not a CVSS, at least in terms of not a CVSS, at least in terms of not a complete CVSsore, right, and they're complete CVSsore, right, and they're complete CVSsore, right, and they're just viewing the basics, is that just viewing the basics, is that just viewing the basics, is that um it doesn't take into account context. um it doesn't take into account context. um it doesn't take into account context. So they don't want to provide it because So they don't want to provide it because So they don't want to provide it because if they did depending on the context it if they did depending on the context it if they did depending on the context it would be a 10 for everything. I think would be a 10 for everything. I think would be a 10 for everything. I think that might be a case where maybe there's that might be a case where maybe there's that might be a case where maybe there's a lot that are not getting that, but I I a lot that are not getting that, but I I a lot that are not getting that, but I I can't speak to it in general. But can't speak to it in general. But can't speak to it in general. But generally speaking, yes, if it's not generally speaking, yes, if it's not generally speaking, yes, if it's not being provided by the CNA or a third being provided by the CNA or a third being provided by the CNA or a third stream, a third party, which I would stream, a third party, which I would stream, a third party, which I would think it would be um through either the think it would be um through either the think it would be um through either the uh CVE ADP uh in the program or or NVD uh CVE ADP uh in the program or or NVD uh CVE ADP uh in the program or or NVD down the line, then I would think Sorry, down the line, then I would think Sorry, down the line, then I would think Sorry, you looked like you were going to say you looked like you were going to say you looked like you were going to say something. something. something. I was going to say Yeah, exactly. Yeah, I was going to say Yeah, exactly. Yeah, I was going to say Yeah, exactly. Yeah, it's either those two things being added it's either those two things being added it's either those two things being added after the fact um if the CNA isn't after the fact um if the CNA isn't after the fact um if the CNA isn't providing it. Yeah. providing it. Yeah. providing it. Yeah. So, an earlier speaker from another So, an earlier speaker from another So, an earlier speaker from another session this morning uh said that uh session this morning uh said that uh session this morning uh said that uh there should be more CNAs and that that there should be more CNAs and that that there should be more CNAs and that that should include the software should include the software should include the software manufacturers themselves. Uh an audience manufacturers themselves. Uh an audience manufacturers themselves. Uh an audience member from that session that asked the member from that session that asked the member from that session that asked the speaker um basically challenged that and speaker um basically challenged that and speaker um basically challenged that and said wouldn't that create a conflict? said wouldn't that create a conflict? said wouldn't that create a conflict? I'm just curious your take on that. I'm just curious your take on that. I'm just curious your take on that. We have hundreds of CNAs that are We have hundreds of CNAs that are We have hundreds of CNAs that are software producers. Um, in fact, software producers. Um, in fact, software producers. Um, in fact, software producers know the code better software producers know the code better software producers know the code better than anybody else and are best than anybody else and are best than anybody else and are best positioned to provide enrichment data positioned to provide enrichment data positioned to provide enrichment data about uh their vulnerabilities. Did I about uh their vulnerabilities. Did I about uh their vulnerabilities. Did I did I understand your question did I understand your question did I understand your question correctly? Yeah, just comment on Yeah. correctly? Yeah, just comment on Yeah. correctly? Yeah, just comment on Yeah. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Hi, we have some uh virtual questions. I Hi, we have some uh virtual questions. I Hi, we have some uh virtual questions. I know we're I know we're Is it okay to go know we're I know we're Is it okay to go know we're I know we're Is it okay to go over because I think I'm only half hour over because I think I'm only half hour over because I think I'm only half hour but Oh, I thought you were till 3:30. but Oh, I thought you were till 3:30. but Oh, I thought you were till 3:30.

Yeah. Okay. I got water. Great. Okay. Yeah. Okay. I got water. Great. Okay. First virtual question. What if DHS gets First virtual question. What if DHS gets First virtual question. What if DHS gets severe funding cuts under the current severe funding cuts under the current severe funding cuts under the current administration leading to the CVE administration leading to the CVE administration leading to the CVE contract at MITER being cancelled? Yeah, contract at MITER being cancelled? Yeah, contract at MITER being cancelled? Yeah, that's not relevant to this conversation that's not relevant to this conversation that's not relevant to this conversation at all. at all. at all. I'm not sure even how to answer it, but I'm not sure even how to answer it, but I'm not sure even how to answer it, but that's not appropriate for the call. that's not appropriate for the call. that's not appropriate for the call. Yeah. Okay. Um, next question. Uh, for Yeah. Okay. Um, next question. Uh, for Yeah. Okay. Um, next question. Uh, for CNAs, is there some review performed by CNAs, is there some review performed by CNAs, is there some review performed by MITER about CVEEs assigned to the CNAs MITER about CVEEs assigned to the CNAs MITER about CVEEs assigned to the CNAs as um quality of service process? So, as um quality of service process? So, as um quality of service process? So, just understanding the question, the just understanding the question, the just understanding the question, the phrasing was a little weird. So, is phrasing was a little weird. So, is phrasing was a little weird. So, is there a review quality control for CNAs there a review quality control for CNAs there a review quality control for CNAs providing records to the program? I providing records to the program? I providing records to the program? I think does MITER does MITER have a think does MITER does MITER have a think does MITER does MITER have a centralized audit let's say of CNA data? centralized audit let's say of CNA data? centralized audit let's say of CNA data? I think that's what the question is I think that's what the question is I think that's what the question is getting at. Yes. No. The MITER MITER getting at. Yes. No. The MITER MITER getting at. Yes. No. The MITER MITER like as an entity MITER's roles in the like as an entity MITER's roles in the like as an entity MITER's roles in the program include a number of things. program include a number of things. program include a number of things. Running a top level route running the Running a top level route running the Running a top level route running the MITER uh top level route CNLR running MITER uh top level route CNLR running MITER uh top level route CNLR running the MITER uh excuse me running the CVE the MITER uh excuse me running the CVE the MITER uh excuse me running the CVE program secretariat but part of its program secretariat but part of its program secretariat but part of its roles are not auditing CV CNA data roles are not auditing CV CNA data roles are not auditing CV CNA data provided to the CVE program. Okay, thank provided to the CVE program. Okay, thank provided to the CVE program. Okay, thank you. We Well, that's a great point. you. We Well, that's a great point. you. We Well, that's a great point. Thank you for clarifying that. I mean, Thank you for clarifying that. I mean, Thank you for clarifying that. I mean, there are rules for this program. It's a there are rules for this program. It's a there are rules for this program. It's a rules-based program. There are CNA rules-based program. There are CNA rules-based program. There are CNA operational rules, but I don't know if operational rules, but I don't know if operational rules, but I don't know if that's the question that's being asked. that's the question that's being asked. that's the question that's being asked. I think it was more along the lines of I think it was more along the lines of I think it was more along the lines of the data itself. If we're auditing the the data itself. If we're auditing the the data itself. If we're auditing the data and what what is controlling the data and what what is controlling the data and what what is controlling the operations of the program which touches operations of the program which touches operations of the program which touches on the quality of the data perhaps is on the quality of the data perhaps is on the quality of the data perhaps is the CNA operational rules and other the CNA operational rules and other the CNA operational rules and other rules around the program in terms of rules around the program in terms of rules around the program in terms of uh well CNA operations uh disputes uh well CNA operations uh disputes uh well CNA operations uh disputes um end of life things all all sorts of um end of life things all all sorts of um end of life things all all sorts of stuff. Okay, great. Uh we have another stuff. Okay, great. Uh we have another stuff. Okay, great. Uh we have another virtual question. Besides CISA, are virtual question. Besides CISA, are virtual question. Besides CISA, are other parties in the queue to other parties in the queue to other parties in the queue to provide vulnerrichment to CVEes? So first and foremost, I hope the CVEes? So first and foremost, I hope the CVEes? So first and foremost, I hope the most important thing from this talk is most important thing from this talk is most important thing from this talk is that CNAs are best positioned to provide that CNAs are best positioned to provide that CNAs are best positioned to provide enrichment information. Um so that's the enrichment information. Um so that's the enrichment information. Um so that's the first thing. If they don't provide that first thing. If they don't provide that first thing. If they don't provide that information, the SISA 80P uh called von information, the SISA 80P uh called von information, the SISA 80P uh called von enrichment a part of its mission is to enrichment a part of its mission is to enrichment a part of its mission is to provide certain CVE excuse me certain provide certain CVE excuse me certain provide certain CVE excuse me certain enrichment information as part of their enrichment information as part of their enrichment information as part of their mission if it's not provided by the CNA. mission if it's not provided by the CNA. mission if it's not provided by the CNA. Um I can't speak for the NVD but they Um I can't speak for the NVD but they Um I can't speak for the NVD but they also do enrichment activities and they also do enrichment activities and they also do enrichment activities and they have a queue that they work through. Um have a queue that they work through. Um have a queue that they work through. Um at this time those are the third parties at this time those are the third parties at this time those are the third parties that would provide the information if that would provide the information if that would provide the information if it's not provided by the CNA. Okay. it's not provided by the CNA. Okay. it's not provided by the CNA. Okay. Okay. And I think those are all the Okay. And I think those are all the Okay. And I think those are all the virtual questions. There's one. All virtual questions. There's one. All virtual questions. There's one. All right. There are um this is virtual right. There are um this is virtual right. There are um this is virtual again. There are 250 CNAs on the ERL, again. There are 250 CNAs on the ERL, again. There are 250 CNAs on the ERL, but less than 180 CNAs have been but less than 180 CNAs have been but less than 180 CNAs have been published CVE since the start of the published CVE since the start of the published CVE since the start of the program, April 2024. If if a CNA meets program, April 2024. If if a CNA meets program, April 2024. If if a CNA meets the ER erl guidelines one time, are they the ER erl guidelines one time, are they the ER erl guidelines one time, are they continuously continually on the list? continuously continually on the list? continuously continually on the list? Would it make sense to limit the list of Would it make sense to limit the list of Would it make sense to limit the list of the CNAs who published in the last 90 the CNAs who published in the last 90 the CNAs who published in the last 90 days or another published time frame? So days or another published time frame? So days or another published time frame? So this is the same question that was asked this is the same question that was asked this is the same question that was asked earlier which is fine. It's fine. I what earlier which is fine. It's fine. I what earlier which is fine. It's fine. I what I can say is that um no you're if there I can say is that um no you're if there I can say is that um no you're if there is a discrepancy in the data set. The is a discrepancy in the data set. The is a discrepancy in the data set. The point is that folks that are on the ERL point is that folks that are on the ERL point is that folks that are on the ERL maintain their position on the ERL based maintain their position on the ERL based maintain their position on the ERL based on their continued action uh in their on their continued action uh in their on their continued action uh in their records that they are publishing. So, it records that they are publishing. So, it records that they are publishing. So, it is possible and I know that this happens is possible and I know that this happens is possible and I know that this happens um that organizations that are on the um that organizations that are on the um that organizations that are on the ERL drop off the ERL the next time that ERL drop off the ERL the next time that ERL drop off the ERL the next time that it's calculated. Um however, Jerry, I it's calculated. Um however, Jerry, I it's calculated. Um however, Jerry, I think asked this question in person. I think asked this question in person. I think asked this question in person. I don't know who put it online, but um he don't know who put it online, but um he don't know who put it online, but um he did raise a concern uh because he's did raise a concern uh because he's did raise a concern uh because he's saying that there are too many folks on saying that there are too many folks on saying that there are too many folks on it that shouldn't be uh and we follow it that shouldn't be uh and we follow it that shouldn't be uh and we follow our process for data analysis very our process for data analysis very our process for data analysis very closely. So, I'm I'm curious as to closely. So, I'm I'm curious as to closely. So, I'm I'm curious as to whether or not there's a disconnect in whether or not there's a disconnect in whether or not there's a disconnect in terms of interpretation of who should be terms of interpretation of who should be terms of interpretation of who should be on the list or not. on the list or not. on the list or not. Okay, thank you. Last one. Um, is the Okay, thank you. Last one. Um, is the Okay, thank you. Last one. Um, is the ERL algorithm implementation open ERL algorithm implementation open ERL algorithm implementation open source? The ERL algorithm open source at source? The ERL algorithm open source at source? The ERL algorithm open source at this time? No, I don't think it is. Um, this time? No, I don't think it is. Um, this time? No, I don't think it is. Um, that's certainly something that we that's certainly something that we that's certainly something that we should look into. Um, just so that you should look into. Um, just so that you should look into. Um, just so that you know if there's any questions or know if there's any questions or know if there's any questions or concerns. The calculation of it though concerns. The calculation of it though concerns. The calculation of it though is described, right? Um the code itself is described, right?
