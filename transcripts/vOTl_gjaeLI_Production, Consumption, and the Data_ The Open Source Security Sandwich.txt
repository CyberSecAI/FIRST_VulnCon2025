Um, so, uh, yeah, I'm going to be talking, um, about sort of to be talking, um, about sort of to be talking, um, about sort of software supply chain security and, uh, software supply chain security and, uh, software supply chain security and, uh, a, uh, the open source security sandwich a, uh, the open source security sandwich a, uh, the open source security sandwich before lunch. Hopefully get you nice before lunch. Hopefully get you nice before lunch. Hopefully get you nice and, uh, ready for lunch. Okay, a little bit um, about lunch. Okay, a little bit um, about lunch. Okay, a little bit um, about myself. Okay. So, I'm the um co-founder myself. Okay. So, I'm the um co-founder myself. Okay. So, I'm the um co-founder and CTO of Casari, a software supply and CTO of Casari, a software supply and CTO of Casari, a software supply chain security company. Um before I was chain security company. Um before I was chain security company. Um before I was there, I was doing a whole lot of work there, I was doing a whole lot of work there, I was doing a whole lot of work in sort of fintech and banking and a in sort of fintech and banking and a in sort of fintech and banking and a couple other places like that. I'm also couple other places like that. I'm also couple other places like that. I'm also uh one of the co-authors of a book uh one of the co-authors of a book uh one of the co-authors of a book called Securing the Software Supply called Securing the Software Supply called Securing the Software Supply Chain, um which if you want a free copy, Chain, um which if you want a free copy, Chain, um which if you want a free copy, feel free to uh scan that QR code and um feel free to uh scan that QR code and um feel free to uh scan that QR code and um you can get yourself a free copy to that you can get yourself a free copy to that you can get yourself a free copy to that book. uh that's co-authored by um book. uh that's co-authored by um book. uh that's co-authored by um Brendan Lum from uh Google and uh edited Brendan Lum from uh Google and uh edited Brendan Lum from uh Google and uh edited by Ben Cotton.

The problem, right? cool. All right. The problem, right? cool. All right. The problem, right? Security can often feel like a dumpster Security can often feel like a dumpster Security can often feel like a dumpster fire, right? Uh, why is it always seemed fire, right? Uh, why is it always seemed fire, right? Uh, why is it always seemed like everything is on fire? Let's go, like everything is on fire? Let's go, like everything is on fire? Let's go, you know, last year. What was the big you know, last year. What was the big you know, last year. What was the big thing? Hey, XZ utils, right? Um, there thing? Hey, XZ utils, right? Um, there thing? Hey, XZ utils, right? Um, there seems to be a new back door, a new seems to be a new back door, a new seems to be a new back door, a new vulnerability discovered seemingly at vulnerability discovered seemingly at vulnerability discovered seemingly at least, you know, once a month, once least, you know, once a month, once least, you know, once a month, once every other month. uh you know March of every other month. uh you know March of every other month. uh you know March of last year there was m you know uh there last year there was m you know uh there last year there was m you know uh there was the XZ incident which was a was the XZ incident which was a was the XZ incident which was a malicious actor most likely state malicious actor most likely state malicious actor most likely state sponsored came in injected uh malicious sponsored came in injected uh malicious sponsored came in injected uh malicious code into the actual repo um had code into the actual repo um had code into the actual repo um had modified uh some of the build so that modified uh some of the build so that modified uh some of the build so that when the actual um when XZ was being when the actual um when XZ was being when the actual um when XZ was being built as part of OpenSSH uh you know it built as part of OpenSSH uh you know it built as part of OpenSSH uh you know it would have a um a massive back door that would have a um a massive back door that would have a um a massive back door that would allow a certain attacker to be would allow a certain attacker to be would allow a certain attacker to be able to get into um various other uh you able to get into um various other uh you able to get into um various other uh you know various servers. Um we also had know various servers. Um we also had know various servers. Um we also had stuff like uh folks remember polyfill stuff like uh folks remember polyfill stuff like uh folks remember polyfill from last year as well. We have stuff from last year as well. We have stuff from last year as well. We have stuff like that like that like that where somebody malicious was able to where somebody malicious was able to where somebody malicious was able to hijack sort of polyfill and and and hijack sort of polyfill and and and hijack sort of polyfill and and and update that and then leading to update that and then leading to update that and then leading to everything downstream downloading the everything downstream downloading the everything downstream downloading the vulnerable um vulnerable um vulnerable um dependency. And so here is just um as of dependency. And so here is just um as of dependency. And so here is just um as of I don't know about a half hour ago the I don't know about a half hour ago the I don't know about a half hour ago the latest vulnerabilities um that were latest vulnerabilities um that were latest vulnerabilities um that were listed from the GitHub service listed from the GitHub service listed from the GitHub service advisories right uh just today here you advisories right uh just today here you advisories right uh just today here you know as you can see here most of them know as you can see here most of them know as you can see here most of them are just from this morning right um only are just from this morning right um only are just from this morning right um only one from from yesterday and so I don't one from from yesterday and so I don't one from from yesterday and so I don't even know what any of those are right even know what any of those are right even know what any of those are right now but like it's constantly going on now but like it's constantly going on now but like it's constantly going on and on and on and so you might be and on and on and so you might be and on and on and so you might be tracking you know like do Do you tracking you know like do Do you tracking you know like do Do you actually know whether or not you're actually know whether or not you're actually know whether or not you're actually using any of those? Are you actually using any of those? Are you actually using any of those? Are you sure? Uh I'm not I'm not sure. Uh you sure? Uh I'm not I'm not sure. Uh you sure? Uh I'm not I'm not sure. Uh you know, and and how do you know that your know, and and how do you know that your know, and and how do you know that your dependencies are not using those dependencies are not using those dependencies are not using those things? So let's take a step back, things? So let's take a step back, things? So let's take a step back, right? What is supply chain security right? What is supply chain security right? What is supply chain security really, right? Uh so this is just sort really, right? Uh so this is just sort really, right? Uh so this is just sort of my definition but I believe it to be of my definition but I believe it to be of my definition but I believe it to be a pretty accurate one which is like a pretty accurate one which is like a pretty accurate one which is like software supply chain security is just software supply chain security is just software supply chain security is just the act of securing the production and the act of securing the production and the act of securing the production and consumption of software. In other words, consumption of software. In other words, consumption of software. In other words, it's about securing the SDLC. it's about securing the SDLC. it's about securing the SDLC. Uh so if you're you know um if you are consuming you know if um if you are consuming you know if um if you are consuming you know if you're producing software you're part of you're producing software you're part of you're producing software you're part of somebody else's supply chain and if somebody else's supply chain and if somebody else's supply chain and if you're consuming software you are you're consuming software you are you're consuming software you are pulling things into your uh supply pulling things into your uh supply pulling things into your uh supply chain. Um and the security you know chain. Um and the security you know chain. Um and the security you know security around it is just making sure security around it is just making sure security around it is just making sure you're not pulling anything vulnerable you're not pulling anything vulnerable you're not pulling anything vulnerable nothing malicious that kind of a thing. nothing malicious that kind of a thing. nothing malicious that kind of a thing. Uh I'm not sure if any of you have are Uh I'm not sure if any of you have are Uh I'm not sure if any of you have are super aware of Salsa uh or the Salsa super aware of Salsa uh or the Salsa super aware of Salsa uh or the Salsa framework, but that's a project framework, but that's a project framework, but that's a project underneath the open underneath the open underneath the open SSF. It's essentially a bunch of best SSF. It's essentially a bunch of best SSF. It's essentially a bunch of best practices practices practices around providing providence around uh around providing providence around uh around providing providence around uh software. So for example, how do we, you software. So for example, how do we, you software. So for example, how do we, you know, track that the source code is what know, track that the source code is what know, track that the source code is what actually ended up in the build? Because actually ended up in the build? Because actually ended up in the build? Because again these are things like if you go again these are things like if you go again these are things like if you go back to the XZ utils if you go back to back to the XZ utils if you go back to back to the XZ utils if you go back to uh good example Solar Winds everybody uh good example Solar Winds everybody uh good example Solar Winds everybody remember that one. um you know various remember that one. um you know various remember that one. um you know various pieces of that supply various pieces of pieces of that supply various pieces of pieces of that supply various pieces of the SDLC were compromised which then led the SDLC were compromised which then led the SDLC were compromised which then led to the ability to actually compromise to the ability to actually compromise to the ability to actually compromise the binary and so on and so each one of the binary and so on and so each one of the binary and so on and so each one of those uh letters there is a potential those uh letters there is a potential those uh letters there is a potential area of attack right um and we'll kind area of attack right um and we'll kind area of attack right um and we'll kind of go into what each of those is in a of go into what each of those is in a of go into what each of those is in a second second second here right so again if I go in each one here right so again if I go in each one here right so again if I go in each one of those things from producer source of those things from producer source of those things from producer source build distribution consumer consumer and build distribution consumer consumer and build distribution consumer consumer and the various dependencies can all be the various dependencies can all be the various dependencies can all be areas of areas of areas of attack. attack. attack. And again, so producer, right, the And again, so producer, right, the And again, so producer, right, the developer can be malicious, right? XZ, developer can be malicious, right? XZ, developer can be malicious, right? XZ, take that as an take that as an take that as an example. Authoring and reviewing, right? example. Authoring and reviewing, right? example. Authoring and reviewing, right? Uh mistakes can be made. Uh do folks Uh mistakes can be made. Uh do folks Uh mistakes can be made. Uh do folks remember the open SSH uh regression remember the open SSH uh regression remember the open SSH uh regression attack? That was this was I want to say attack? That was this was I want to say attack? That was this was I want to say 15 years ago, probably 20 years ago 15 years ago, probably 20 years ago 15 years ago, probably 20 years ago almost. uh where hey somebody in trying almost. uh where hey somebody in trying almost. uh where hey somebody in trying to fix some stuff inadvertently to fix some stuff inadvertently to fix some stuff inadvertently um made it so that open SSH was mostly um made it so that open SSH was mostly um made it so that open SSH was mostly like you only had a handful of keys that like you only had a handful of keys that like you only had a handful of keys that uh you needed uh that you needed to sort uh you needed uh that you needed to sort uh you needed uh that you needed to sort of iterate through as opposed to you of iterate through as opposed to you of iterate through as opposed to you know some uh uh massive number. Um you know some uh uh massive number. Um you know some uh uh massive number. Um you have source code management right your have source code management right your have source code management right your your source forge can be actually your source forge can be actually your source forge can be actually compromised through stuff like you know compromised through stuff like you know compromised through stuff like you know remember the code cv attack. Uh your remember the code cv attack. Uh your remember the code cv attack. Uh your external build parameters right can be external build parameters right can be external build parameters right can be uh attacked right which is like you know uh attacked right which is like you know uh attacked right which is like you know malicious or insecure inputs for the malicious or insecure inputs for the malicious or insecure inputs for the build. So this is the Debian OpenSSL bug build. So this is the Debian OpenSSL bug build. So this is the Debian OpenSSL bug that led to sort of OpenSSL being that led to sort of OpenSSL being that led to sort of OpenSSL being compromised also uh I believe that was compromised also uh I believe that was compromised also uh I believe that was 15 20 years ago. You have the build 15 20 years ago. You have the build 15 20 years ago. You have the build process right the build process itself process right the build process itself process right the build process itself can be compromised. Think Solar Winds can be compromised. Think Solar Winds can be compromised. Think Solar Winds where most likely state sponsored actor where most likely state sponsored actor where most likely state sponsored actor was able to actually compromise the um was able to actually compromise the um was able to actually compromise the um the build system itself so that the build system itself so that the build system itself so that everything looked like it was running everything looked like it was running everything looked like it was running normally and actually you were normally and actually you were normally and actually you were constantly injecting at the very last uh constantly injecting at the very last uh constantly injecting at the very last uh bit a DL DLL that was uh malicious. And bit a DL DLL that was uh malicious. And bit a DL DLL that was uh malicious. And again at that point they already have again at that point they already have again at that point they already have your keys for signing so they were able your keys for signing so they were able your keys for signing so they were able to sign it. It looked uh legit. um to sign it. It looked uh legit. um to sign it. It looked uh legit. um artifact publication, right? We have uh artifact publication, right? We have uh artifact publication, right? We have uh how many time like it seems like every how many time like it seems like every how many time like it seems like every day there's yet another MPM package that day there's yet another MPM package that day there's yet another MPM package that it turns out is mining crypto. Um so a it turns out is mining crypto. Um so a it turns out is mining crypto. Um so a or just somebody is able to steal or just somebody is able to steal or just somebody is able to steal somebody's credentials to publish which somebody's credentials to publish which somebody's credentials to publish which then allows them to sort of publish a then allows them to sort of publish a then allows them to sort of publish a yet another crypto minor um or something yet another crypto minor um or something yet another crypto minor um or something to steal your your your you know your to steal your your your you know your to steal your your your you know your Bitcoin wallets. You have uh various Bitcoin wallets. You have uh various Bitcoin wallets. You have uh various distribution channel attacks, right? So distribution channel attacks, right? So distribution channel attacks, right? So back in the day, Ruby gems was actually back in the day, Ruby gems was actually back in the day, Ruby gems was actually compromised, which uh through some compromised, which uh through some compromised, which uh through some tooling on Ruby gems itself, allowing tooling on Ruby gems itself, allowing tooling on Ruby gems itself, allowing for anybody to publish malicious for anybody to publish malicious for anybody to publish malicious software to Ruby gems without really any software to Ruby gems without really any software to Ruby gems without really any checks. And then also package selection, checks. And then also package selection, checks. And then also package selection, right? You know, when you're actually right? You know, when you're actually right? You know, when you're actually pulling down the thing, did I type in pulling down the thing, did I type in pulling down the thing, did I type in request or request or request or requests, right? There was that was a requests, right? There was that was a requests, right? There was that was a common uh issue from a few years back common uh issue from a few years back common uh issue from a few years back where uh I believe it's actually where uh I believe it's actually where uh I believe it's actually requests is the Python library and some requests is the Python library and some requests is the Python library and some folks put in request somebody had said folks put in request somebody had said folks put in request somebody had said great I see that I'm going to make great I see that I'm going to make great I see that I'm going to make something that looks very similar to the something that looks very similar to the something that looks very similar to the actual request library type request and actual request library type request and actual request library type request and then all of a sudden everybody's being then all of a sudden everybody's being then all of a sudden everybody's being downloading malicious software and it's also all recursive software and it's also all recursive software and it's also all recursive right it's not just about what you're right it's not just about what you're right it's not just about what you're currently including but it's also what currently including but it's also what currently including but it's also what are the things you're using that that are the things you're using that that are the things you're using that that are they protecting themselves. So if are they protecting themselves. So if are they protecting themselves. So if I'm using I don't know Open SSH and Open I'm using I don't know Open SSH and Open I'm using I don't know Open SSH and Open SSH is using XZ do I need to be aware of SSH is using XZ do I need to be aware of SSH is using XZ do I need to be aware of that? That's kind of um a big issue as that? That's kind of um a big issue as that? That's kind of um a big issue as well. And it's turtles all the way down well. And it's turtles all the way down well. And it's turtles all the way down as they say, right? It's not enough just as they say, right? It's not enough just as they say, right? It's not enough just to fix the problem in your software. uh to fix the problem in your software. uh to fix the problem in your software. uh you need to um also it's about the you need to um also it's about the you need to um also it's about the software your software uses and the software your software uses and the software your software uses and the problem is not just in the software it's problem is not just in the software it's problem is not just in the software it's in the hardware it's often also outside in the hardware it's often also outside in the hardware it's often also outside of your control because you're dealing of your control because you're dealing of your control because you're dealing with systems like Pippi and and Maven with systems like Pippi and and Maven with systems like Pippi and and Maven Central and how do you know everybody is Central and how do you know everybody is Central and how do you know everybody is doing the right thing now like Maven doing the right thing now like Maven doing the right thing now like Maven Central right is backed by a commercial Central right is backed by a commercial Central right is backed by a commercial enterprise they have a lot to lose but a enterprise they have a lot to lose but a enterprise they have a lot to lose but a lot of folks are nonprofits and how do lot of folks are nonprofits and how do lot of folks are nonprofits and how do you know that they're actually uh doing you know that they're actually uh doing you know that they're actually uh doing the right stuff there as well. And it seems like there's a lot to well. And it seems like there's a lot to well. And it seems like there's a lot to keep track of. This is super simplified, keep track of. This is super simplified, keep track of. This is super simplified, right? It's probably would look 20 or 30 right? It's probably would look 20 or 30 right? It's probably would look 20 or 30 layers deep. It'd be impossible to see. layers deep. It'd be impossible to see. layers deep. It'd be impossible to see. Um, you know, uh, one time I ran a, uh, Um, you know, uh, one time I ran a, uh, Um, you know, uh, one time I ran a, uh, I don't have it up here because it's I don't have it up here because it's I don't have it up here because it's just way too large, but one time I just way too large, but one time I just way too large, but one time I actually ran the full sort of dependency actually ran the full sort of dependency actually ran the full sort of dependency of Kubernetes, including all of the of Kubernetes, including all of the of Kubernetes, including all of the operating system level dependencies and operating system level dependencies and operating system level dependencies and all the things that are required to all the things that are required to all the things that are required to build Go, right? How do you know that build Go, right? How do you know that build Go, right? How do you know that the compiler you're using is uh, the compiler you're using is uh, the compiler you're using is uh, correct? How do you know that the correct? How do you know that the correct? How do you know that the compiler the compiler was using is compiler the compiler was using is compiler the compiler was using is correct? And so you all of these things correct? And so you all of these things correct? And so you all of these things are are things that you should be are are things that you should be are are things that you should be keeping track of but are obviously very keeping track of but are obviously very keeping track of but are obviously very very very very difficult. It's not all difficult. It's not all difficult. It's not all bad. Um it's not all doom and gloom. Uh bad. Um it's not all doom and gloom. Uh bad. Um it's not all doom and gloom. Uh there's been a lot of work in bringing there's been a lot of work in bringing there's been a lot of work in bringing sort of order to all the chaos in the sort of order to all the chaos in the sort of order to all the chaos in the open source community. There's been a open source community. There's been a open source community. There's been a bunch of white papers. There's books bunch of white papers. There's books bunch of white papers. There's books being written about this on how to start being written about this on how to start being written about this on how to start dealing with sort of supply chain dealing with sort of supply chain dealing with sort of supply chain security. There's also tons of tools security. There's also tons of tools security. There's also tons of tools being developed in the space and uh being developed in the space and uh being developed in the space and uh we'll explore some of those in just a we'll explore some of those in just a we'll explore some of those in just a little bit. little bit. little bit. In addition, we're seeing work in the In addition, we're seeing work in the In addition, we're seeing work in the community industry and in government as community industry and in government as community industry and in government as well. Um, and you know, for example, the well. Um, and you know, for example, the well. Um, and you know, for example, the CRA for folks who are been hearing a lot CRA for folks who are been hearing a lot CRA for folks who are been hearing a lot about that this week. And okay, so how do we get started week. And okay, so how do we get started week. And okay, so how do we get started with this? Right? We we could sit here with this? Right? We we could sit here with this? Right? We we could sit here for days talking about all the for days talking about all the for days talking about all the approaches and potential solutions uh to approaches and potential solutions uh to approaches and potential solutions uh to all the supply chain security problems all the supply chain security problems all the supply chain security problems we have. We don't have days. So let's we have. We don't have days. So let's we have. We don't have days. So let's look at a couple of common easy ones. It's just regular security, right? Don't It's just regular security, right? Don't It's just regular security, right? Don't treat it any differently. It you can treat it any differently. It you can treat it any differently. It you can apply the same practices you do to apply the same practices you do to apply the same practices you do to runtime as you do to supply chain runtime as you do to supply chain runtime as you do to supply chain security. Um, you know, threat model, security. Um, you know, threat model, security. Um, you know, threat model, determine, you know, important assets determine, you know, important assets determine, you know, important assets and risks, design controls around those and risks, design controls around those and risks, design controls around those risks and implement those controls. And risks and implement those controls. And risks and implement those controls. And also, it's going to be very different, also, it's going to be very different, also, it's going to be very different, right? If I am building my personal right? If I am building my personal right? If I am building my personal blog, I'll have a very different blog, I'll have a very different blog, I'll have a very different approach to software supply chain approach to software supply chain approach to software supply chain security than if I'm building out an security than if I'm building out an security than if I'm building out an online banking application. Uh if I'm online banking application. Uh if I'm online banking application. Uh if I'm doing, you know, my personal blog, I'm doing, you know, my personal blog, I'm doing, you know, my personal blog, I'm I'll take reasonable precautions, but I I'll take reasonable precautions, but I I'll take reasonable precautions, but I don't have millions or billions of don't have millions or billions of don't have millions or billions of dollars at stake for my personal blog. I dollars at stake for my personal blog. I dollars at stake for my personal blog. I just have a little bit of my reputation. just have a little bit of my reputation. just have a little bit of my reputation. Um still want to be able to do the right Um still want to be able to do the right Um still want to be able to do the right things, but I'm probably going to be things, but I'm probably going to be things, but I'm probably going to be using open source. I'm going to be using using open source. I'm going to be using using open source. I'm going to be using free tools. I'm going to be using GitHub free tools. I'm going to be using GitHub free tools. I'm going to be using GitHub actions. I'm going to be using all the actions. I'm going to be using all the actions. I'm going to be using all the great stuff from open SSF, CNCF, ELF, great stuff from open SSF, CNCF, ELF, great stuff from open SSF, CNCF, ELF, Eclipse Foundation across open source. Eclipse Foundation across open source. Eclipse Foundation across open source. Um, I'll be keeping stuff up to date, Um, I'll be keeping stuff up to date, Um, I'll be keeping stuff up to date, but I'm not going to be spending a ton but I'm not going to be spending a ton but I'm not going to be spending a ton of time and effort to to going beyond of time and effort to to going beyond of time and effort to to going beyond that. Now, if it's a banking application that. Now, if it's a banking application that. Now, if it's a banking application on the other hand, I'll be spending a on the other hand, I'll be spending a on the other hand, I'll be spending a lot more time, resources, and effort uh lot more time, resources, and effort uh lot more time, resources, and effort uh to secure that software supply chain. to secure that software supply chain. to secure that software supply chain. Most likely the bank will have uh you Most likely the bank will have uh you Most likely the bank will have uh you know probably multiple systems running know probably multiple systems running know probably multiple systems running internally to help with vulnerability internally to help with vulnerability internally to help with vulnerability management, dependency management, management, dependency management, management, dependency management, firewalls, whatever. Each dependency firewalls, whatever. Each dependency firewalls, whatever. Each dependency that gets pulled in will most likely go that gets pulled in will most likely go that gets pulled in will most likely go through a more rigorous uh process, go through a more rigorous uh process, go through a more rigorous uh process, go through proxies, go through SAS and DAS through proxies, go through SAS and DAS through proxies, go through SAS and DAS scans. Uh each version of uh Whoops. scans. Uh each version of uh Whoops. scans. Uh each version of uh Whoops. Um, each version of the software will Um, each version of the software will Um, each version of the software will most likely also go through some sort of most likely also go through some sort of most likely also go through some sort of thirdparty risk management, open- source thirdparty risk management, open- source thirdparty risk management, open- source risk management, something like that. risk management, something like that. risk management, something like that. There'll be defense and depth, right? There'll be defense and depth, right? There'll be defense and depth, right? You'll have firewalls and runtime You'll have firewalls and runtime You'll have firewalls and runtime controls to also mitigate potential controls to also mitigate potential controls to also mitigate potential attack paths and um you know also attack paths and um you know also attack paths and um you know also various detective measures that if all various detective measures that if all various detective measures that if all of that is still compromised, hey uh of that is still compromised, hey uh of that is still compromised, hey uh your your your your security you know your your your your security you know your your your your security you know your sock is going to go and get a um an your sock is going to go and get a um an your sock is going to go and get a um an alert that something has alert that something has alert that something has happened. Okay, you've done your threat happened. Okay, you've done your threat happened. Okay, you've done your threat model. Now what uh you probably have model. Now what uh you probably have model. Now what uh you probably have some questions running through your head some questions running through your head some questions running through your head based on the previous slides, right? You based on the previous slides, right? You based on the previous slides, right? You probably wonder what you can get started probably wonder what you can get started probably wonder what you can get started on today uh that haps hap that that on today uh that haps hap that that on today uh that haps hap that that helps with your average use case. You helps with your average use case. You helps with your average use case. You care about security, but you're not care about security, but you're not care about security, but you're not looking to prevent progress, right? Way looking to prevent progress, right? Way looking to prevent progress, right? Way too many folks are, you know, uh I know too many folks are, you know, uh I know too many folks are, you know, uh I know a lot of us are in security, so we're a lot of us are in security, so we're a lot of us are in security, so we're like, uh, who cares about the features? like, uh, who cares about the features? like, uh, who cares about the features? It's it's, you know, the product team's It's it's, you know, the product team's It's it's, you know, the product team's responsibility. It's us to just sort of responsibility. It's us to just sort of responsibility. It's us to just sort of make sure stuff is secure. At the same make sure stuff is secure. At the same make sure stuff is secure. At the same time, it's always going to be that time, it's always going to be that time, it's always going to be that trade-off. you want to be safe, but you trade-off. you want to be safe, but you trade-off. you want to be safe, but you don't have the resources to, let's say, don't have the resources to, let's say, don't have the resources to, let's say, build the Linux kernel yourself, right? build the Linux kernel yourself, right? build the Linux kernel yourself, right? Maybe you do depending on your your Maybe you do depending on your your Maybe you do depending on your your particular company organization you work particular company organization you work particular company organization you work at, but a lot of folks don't have that. at, but a lot of folks don't have that. at, but a lot of folks don't have that. Um, most importantly, you're probably Um, most importantly, you're probably Um, most importantly, you're probably wondering uh how you know if any of the wondering uh how you know if any of the wondering uh how you know if any of the security changes uh you're making are security changes uh you're making are security changes uh you're making are even even even working. And so security really it's working. And so security really it's working. And so security really it's it's all about tracking what is it's all about tracking what is it's all about tracking what is happening in your systems, what's happening in your systems, what's happening in your systems, what's happening in your supply chains. uh you happening in your supply chains. uh you happening in your supply chains. uh you want to track obviously network traffic want to track obviously network traffic want to track obviously network traffic to determine anomalies things like that. to determine anomalies things like that. to determine anomalies things like that. The same is true right for the software The same is true right for the software The same is true right for the software supply chain um but it's probably less supply chain um but it's probably less supply chain um but it's probably less mature than you know supply chain mature than you know supply chain mature than you know supply chain security and so we want to track security and so we want to track security and so we want to track software as it makes its way from software as it makes its way from software as it makes its way from developer through to consumption and all developer through to consumption and all developer through to consumption and all the layers throughout. We want to have the layers throughout. We want to have the layers throughout. We want to have enough metadata about the software to be enough metadata about the software to be enough metadata about the software to be useful to determine who did what and useful to determine who did what and useful to determine who did what and when. So we have an idea of what to fix when. So we have an idea of what to fix when. So we have an idea of what to fix uh moving forward. Without this data uh moving forward. Without this data uh moving forward. Without this data being explicitly created and consumed in being explicitly created and consumed in being explicitly created and consumed in in your systems, it's often dis in your systems, it's often dis in your systems, it's often dis difficult, if not impossible, to figure difficult, if not impossible, to figure difficult, if not impossible, to figure out what is vulnerable or compromised out what is vulnerable or compromised out what is vulnerable or compromised and what needs to be done to fix it. It and what needs to be done to fix it. It and what needs to be done to fix it. It also makes it much easier when you're also makes it much easier when you're also makes it much easier when you're following open specifications around following open specifications around following open specifications around this data than using something this data than using something this data than using something proprietary. Uh for example, it's proprietary. Uh for example, it's proprietary. Uh for example, it's generally better to use open telemetry generally better to use open telemetry generally better to use open telemetry over a specific vendor's closed over a specific vendor's closed over a specific vendor's closed ecosystem since there will usually be ecosystem since there will usually be ecosystem since there will usually be more support not just in the open source more support not just in the open source more support not just in the open source but also through other vendors in the but also through other vendors in the but also through other vendors in the open specification than you know a open specification than you know a open specification than you know a certain company's very specific data certain company's very specific data certain company's very specific data format. format. format. So here's some examples here, right? As So here's some examples here, right? As So here's some examples here, right? As opposed to proprietary software opposed to proprietary software opposed to proprietary software composition analysis reports, use composition analysis reports, use composition analysis reports, use sbombs, right? Um it's just a common sbombs, right? Um it's just a common sbombs, right? Um it's just a common format, right? as opposed to just sort format, right? as opposed to just sort format, right? as opposed to just sort of dumping your logs purely to Splunk of dumping your logs purely to Splunk of dumping your logs purely to Splunk for like let's say your build, use stuff for like let's say your build, use stuff for like let's say your build, use stuff like salsa and use into add a stations like salsa and use into add a stations like salsa and use into add a stations that that are used to sort of track that that are used to sort of track that that are used to sort of track what's happening in salsa as opposed to what's happening in salsa as opposed to what's happening in salsa as opposed to you know putting your exception for a you know putting your exception for a you know putting your exception for a vulnerability in just something like I vulnerability in just something like I vulnerability in just something like I don't know an email a ticketing system don't know an email a ticketing system don't know an email a ticketing system use VEX or you know hey open VEX um as use VEX or you know hey open VEX um as use VEX or you know hey open VEX um as opposed to having proprietary health opposed to having proprietary health opposed to having proprietary health metrics on every little thing. Use open metrics on every little thing. Use open metrics on every little thing. Use open things like scorecard uh as you know things like scorecard uh as you know things like scorecard uh as you know instead of again I can go through each instead of again I can go through each instead of again I can go through each of these but uh I'll just kind of go to of these but uh I'll just kind of go to of these but uh I'll just kind of go to to one of two of the other ones. Um, to one of two of the other ones. Um, to one of two of the other ones. Um, hey, as opposed to doing like building hey, as opposed to doing like building hey, as opposed to doing like building your own custom analysis for your supply your own custom analysis for your supply your own custom analysis for your supply chain, you can use something like guac, chain, you can use something like guac, chain, you can use something like guac, right, which is an open SSF uh tool. And right, which is an open SSF uh tool. And right, which is an open SSF uh tool. And then when you're doing sort of control then when you're doing sort of control then when you're doing sort of control spreadsheets for ingestion and all that spreadsheets for ingestion and all that spreadsheets for ingestion and all that sort of stuff, uh you you know use sort of stuff, uh you you know use sort of stuff, uh you you know use something like Ocal for folks who are something like Ocal for folks who are something like Ocal for folks who are familiar with that and uh familiar with that and uh familiar with that and uh S2C2F and the same thing here with like S2C2F and the same thing here with like S2C2F and the same thing here with like you know don't just tightly couple your you know don't just tightly couple your you know don't just tightly couple your systems. You can use eventbased systems systems. You can use eventbased systems systems.

Uh what else? Uh you know we also have Uh what else? Uh you know we also have Uh what else? Uh you know we also have sort of runbooks and ticketing but maybe sort of runbooks and ticketing but maybe sort of runbooks and ticketing but maybe you should use stuff like in to layouts you should use stuff like in to layouts you should use stuff like in to layouts which are a description of what actions which are a description of what actions which are a description of what actions are allowed to happen in your supply are allowed to happen in your supply are allowed to happen in your supply chain. And then um as opposed to also chain. And then um as opposed to also chain. And then um as opposed to also just trusting arbitrary tools for just trusting arbitrary tools for just trusting arbitrary tools for updates, you can look at something updates, you can look at something updates, you can look at something called the update framework which comes called the update framework which comes called the update framework which comes or tough which comes from the CNCF um or tough which comes from the CNCF um or tough which comes from the CNCF um and NYU and that allows you to sort of and NYU and that allows you to sort of and NYU and that allows you to sort of essentially enforce that yes this update essentially enforce that yes this update essentially enforce that yes this update came from the right party that yes uh it came from the right party that yes uh it came from the right party that yes uh it it it came in a timely manner um that it it came in a timely manner um that it it came in a timely manner um that even if let's say somebody is preventing even if let's say somebody is preventing even if let's say somebody is preventing me from seeing an update I can detect me from seeing an update I can detect me from seeing an update I can detect that somebody is preventing me from that somebody is preventing me from that somebody is preventing me from seeing an update. seeing an update. seeing an update. Quickly, the elephant in the room, Quickly, the elephant in the room, Quickly, the elephant in the room, sbombs. We all love them, we all hate sbombs. We all love them, we all hate sbombs.

They're machine readable and support around them is readable and support around them is readable and support around them is growing every day, right? We're seeing a growing every day, right? We're seeing a growing every day, right? We're seeing a lot more tools both in better generation lot more tools both in better generation lot more tools both in better generation as well as better consumption analysis, as well as better consumption analysis, as well as better consumption analysis, that sort of thing. that sort of thing. that sort of thing. With that said, uh when everything when With that said, uh when everything when With that said, uh when everything when all you have is a hammer, everything all you have is a hammer, everything all you have is a hammer, everything looks like a nail. Uh there's a lot too looks like a nail. Uh there's a lot too looks like a nail. Uh there's a lot too much focus on just throwing everything much focus on just throwing everything much focus on just throwing everything into an SBOM without really thinking into an SBOM without really thinking into an SBOM without really thinking about what it uses.

You know, you can use, you know, Sith Trivy, SPDX, Cyclone DX, you know, Sith Trivy, SPDX, Cyclone DX, you know, Sith Trivy, SPDX, Cyclone DX, you know, you can look at tools like uh bomb CTL you can look at tools like uh bomb CTL you can look at tools like uh bomb CTL and various other things to kind of and various other things to kind of and various other things to kind of enrich your sbombs, work with them, that enrich your sbombs, work with them, that enrich your sbombs, work with them, that sort of stuff. sort of stuff. sort of stuff. uh but few tools right now consume and uh but few tools right now consume and uh but few tools right now consume and store esbombs. Now again in the open store esbombs. Now again in the open store esbombs. Now again in the open source right I know a lot of vendors source right I know a lot of vendors source right I know a lot of vendors have a lot of various projects but very have a lot of various projects but very have a lot of various projects but very few open source projects really do a lot few open source projects really do a lot few open source projects really do a lot with analyzing and storing sbombs and with analyzing and storing sbombs and with analyzing and storing sbombs and it's not just sbombs there's a ton more it's not just sbombs there's a ton more it's not just sbombs there's a ton more supply chain metadata you have things supply chain metadata you have things supply chain metadata you have things like into salsa uh openvex scorecard OSV like into salsa uh openvex scorecard OSV like into salsa uh openvex scorecard OSV all this great all this great all this great stuff okay so what's the solution stuff okay so what's the solution stuff okay so what's the solution um here's an example right this is the um here's an example right this is the um here's an example right this is the sandwich. Uh, at the top there you have sandwich. Uh, at the top there you have sandwich. Uh, at the top there you have stuff that is focused on software stuff that is focused on software stuff that is focused on software production. So you're talking about production. So you're talking about production. So you're talking about Salsa, you're talking about VEX, you're Salsa, you're talking about VEX, you're Salsa, you're talking about VEX, you're talking about Scorecard, Allstar, talking about Scorecard, Allstar, talking about Scorecard, Allstar, Witness, things that are used to help Witness, things that are used to help Witness, things that are used to help secure the uh production of software. secure the uh production of software. secure the uh production of software. And then in the middle there you have And then in the middle there you have And then in the middle there you have stuff like GU archive Vista OSV security stuff like GU archive Vista OSV security stuff like GU archive Vista OSV security insights stuff about hey based on all insights stuff about hey based on all insights stuff about hey based on all that data now that's being generated at that data now that's being generated at that data now that's being generated at production time let's pull that in scan production time let's pull that in scan production time let's pull that in scan it analyze it yada yada you now have all it analyze it yada yada you now have all it analyze it yada yada you now have all this great data that about those open this great data that about those open this great data that about those open source projects that can then be used by source projects that can then be used by source projects that can then be used by consumers right who can then ask consumers right who can then ask consumers right who can then ask questions about that software that's questions about that software that's questions about that software that's being built so did it follow Salsa if so being built so did it follow Salsa if so being built so did it follow Salsa if so at what level um is is this following my at what level um is is this following my at what level um is is this following my internal policy all that good stuff. internal policy all that good stuff. internal policy all that good stuff. Uh so you know a good example here is Uh so you know a good example here is Uh so you know a good example here is OSV right you're generating a bunch of OSV right you're generating a bunch of OSV right you're generating a bunch of stuff blah blah blah you know OSV has a stuff blah blah blah you know OSV has a stuff blah blah blah you know OSV has a database of all these vulnerabilities database of all these vulnerabilities database of all these vulnerabilities OSV tooling can then be used to then say OSV tooling can then be used to then say OSV tooling can then be used to then say yes this thing is vulnerable no this yes this thing is vulnerable no this yes this thing is vulnerable no this thing is not thing is not thing is not vulnerable and um on the left hand side vulnerable and um on the left hand side vulnerable and um on the left hand side there is if that's the sandwich the there is if that's the sandwich the there is if that's the sandwich the lefth hand side is kind of like the lefth hand side is kind of like the lefth hand side is kind of like the rules for making the sandwich right in rules for making the sandwich right in rules for making the sandwich right in order to make a secure sandwich uh you order to make a secure sandwich uh you order to make a secure sandwich uh you should be you know using into you should should be you know using into you should should be you know using into you should be signing stuff with sig store or be signing stuff with sig store or be signing stuff with sig store or similar sorts of tools, you should be similar sorts of tools, you should be similar sorts of tools, you should be following like the baseline as an following like the baseline as an following like the baseline as an example. You know, if you're following example. You know, if you're following example. You know, if you're following the baseline, I feel a lot safer about the baseline, I feel a lot safer about the baseline, I feel a lot safer about that sandwich than if you know uh uh uh that sandwich than if you know uh uh uh that sandwich than if you know uh uh uh you're just not telling me what you're you're just not telling me what you're you're just not telling me what you're following at all. And so here's kind of maybe another all. And so here's kind of maybe another all. And so here's kind of maybe another look at this more from a depth look at this more from a depth look at this more from a depth perspective, right? So when you're sort perspective, right? So when you're sort perspective, right? So when you're sort of approaching open-source software and of approaching open-source software and of approaching open-source software and and and building open source software or and and building open source software or and and building open source software or even consuming open source software, you even consuming open source software, you even consuming open source software, you have a couple of different things that have a couple of different things that have a couple of different things that you're concerned with, right? The first you're concerned with, right? The first you're concerned with, right? The first thing is who's doing what? Right? That's thing is who's doing what? Right? That's thing is who's doing what? Right? That's the trust foundation. Who do I even know the trust foundation. Who do I even know the trust foundation. Who do I even know is in my supply chain? Is this am I is in my supply chain? Is this am I is in my supply chain? Is this am I downloading this package from Google, downloading this package from Google, downloading this package from Google, you know, IBM, or is this just from a you know, IBM, or is this just from a you know, IBM, or is this just from a random person? Right? I still like even random person? Right? I still like even random person? Right? I still like even if I trust the random person, I still if I trust the random person, I still if I trust the random person, I still want to know who it came from. Then you want to know who it came from. Then you want to know who it came from. Then you want to be able to say, okay, well, want to be able to say, okay, well, want to be able to say, okay, well, who's doing what in my supply chain and who's doing what in my supply chain and who's doing what in my supply chain and what are they actually attesting to? So what are they actually attesting to? So what are they actually attesting to? So the answer could be yes, this software the answer could be yes, this software the answer could be yes, this software was written by this person and built in was written by this person and built in was written by this person and built in GitHub, right? That's useful information GitHub, right? That's useful information GitHub, right? That's useful information that if at some point in time, hey, that if at some point in time, hey, that if at some point in time, hey, yesterday GitHub actions had some yesterday GitHub actions had some yesterday GitHub actions had some vulnerability and something might have vulnerability and something might have vulnerability and something might have been compromised. Oh, do we have been compromised. Oh, do we have been compromised. Oh, do we have information about what software was information about what software was information about what software was built yesterday in GitHub actions? We're built yesterday in GitHub actions? We're built yesterday in GitHub actions? We're curious, you know, we're concerned about curious, you know, we're concerned about curious, you know, we're concerned about that. Well, you should start attesting that. Well, you should start attesting that. Well, you should start attesting to all of that stuff. to all of that stuff. to all of that stuff. And then once you've attested to all And then once you've attested to all And then once you've attested to all that stuff, you can aggregate and that stuff, you can aggregate and that stuff, you can aggregate and synthesize it so that you understand, synthesize it so that you understand, synthesize it so that you understand, hey, is this like a oneoff or is this a hey, is this like a oneoff or is this a hey, is this like a oneoff or is this a log for J sort of situation where oh my log for J sort of situation where oh my log for J sort of situation where oh my gosh, this is a hundred applications gosh, this is a hundred applications gosh, this is a hundred applications that have this issue, right? Uh and then that have this issue, right? Uh and then that have this issue, right? Uh and then follow following finally you can then follow following finally you can then follow following finally you can then take all of that great information and take all of that great information and take all of that great information and then get insight out of it, apply policy then get insight out of it, apply policy then get insight out of it, apply policy and action on that. So you can say when and action on that. So you can say when and action on that. So you can say when I see this sort of thing happen, raise I see this sort of thing happen, raise I see this sort of thing happen, raise the alarm bells. When I see this sort of the alarm bells. When I see this sort of the alarm bells. When I see this sort of thing happen, remediate it in this way thing happen, remediate it in this way thing happen, remediate it in this way or prevent it in this way. So we can also tie all of this way. So we can also tie all of this way. So we can also tie all of this together with a tool called Guac. For together with a tool called Guac. For together with a tool called Guac. For those who aren't super familiar, Guac is those who aren't super familiar, Guac is those who aren't super familiar, Guac is an OpenSS project. It's an incubating an OpenSS project. It's an incubating an OpenSS project. It's an incubating OpenSSF project. Pretty much what it OpenSSF project. Pretty much what it OpenSSF project. Pretty much what it does is it takes in lots of different does is it takes in lots of different does is it takes in lots of different supply chain security metadata like supply chain security metadata like supply chain security metadata like OpenSSF scorecard, SPDX, Cyclone DX, OpenSSF scorecard, SPDX, Cyclone DX, OpenSSF scorecard, SPDX, Cyclone DX, vulnerability information, license vulnerability information, license vulnerability information, license information from things like uh clearly information from things like uh clearly information from things like uh clearly defined defined defined depths.dev, all this great stuff to help depths.dev, all this great stuff to help depths.dev, all this great stuff to help you provide insights for sort of policy you provide insights for sort of policy you provide insights for sort of policy checks, patch planning, identifying checks, patch planning, identifying checks, patch planning, identifying critical uh critical infrastructure, all critical uh critical infrastructure, all critical uh critical infrastructure, all that good stuff. And so guac pretty much that good stuff. And so guac pretty much that good stuff. And so guac pretty much the way that it works is we pull all the way that it works is we pull all the way that it works is we pull all this data in. We parse out all the this data in. We parse out all the this data in. We parse out all the elements of that data. So the package elements of that data. So the package elements of that data. So the package urls and all sorts of other stuff to urls and all sorts of other stuff to urls and all sorts of other stuff to then turn it into a graph of various then turn it into a graph of various then turn it into a graph of various facts and facts and facts and information. So this is sort of what a information. So this is sort of what a information. So this is sort of what a guac query looks like. So in this case guac query looks like. So in this case guac query looks like. So in this case it's um you know it's in graphql. It's it's um you know it's in graphql. It's it's um you know it's in graphql. It's just essentially saying hey what do I just essentially saying hey what do I just essentially saying hey what do I you know what are the dependencies of um you know what are the dependencies of um you know what are the dependencies of um of uh of of this Prometheus uh of uh of of this Prometheus uh of uh of of this Prometheus uh here it helps you understand sort of the here it helps you understand sort of the here it helps you understand sort of the unknown knowing the unknown right so unknown knowing the unknown right so unknown knowing the unknown right so it's about observability in your supply it's about observability in your supply it's about observability in your supply chain um you know uh uh yeah what do I chain um you know uh uh yeah what do I chain um you know uh uh yeah what do I know about what do I know and what do I know about what do I know and what do I know about what do I know and what do I not know about the software I'm using so not know about the software I'm using so not know about the software I'm using so as an example here if I want to find out as an example here if I want to find out as an example here if I want to find out information about the Prometheus Golang information about the Prometheus Golang information about the Prometheus Golang client we can see Here there's some client we can see Here there's some client we can see Here there's some information about uh you know it has a information about uh you know it has a information about uh you know it has a vulner it currently has no vulner it currently has no vulner it currently has no vulnerability. You can see that or at vulnerability. You can see that or at vulnerability. You can see that or at least no known vulnerability um and and least no known vulnerability um and and least no known vulnerability um and and uh and the source code comes from that uh and the source code comes from that uh and the source code comes from that GitHub uh repository. Uh if you wanted GitHub uh repository. Uh if you wanted GitHub uh repository. Uh if you wanted to pull in information based on like to pull in information based on like to pull in information based on like let's say a container digest right you let's say a container digest right you let's say a container digest right you can do that as well. And here we can see can do that as well. And here we can see can do that as well. And here we can see that this is um or or rather this is that this is um or or rather this is that this is um or or rather this is just a hash of that software. And so as just a hash of that software. And so as just a hash of that software. And so as we can see here this is for the uh it we can see here this is for the uh it we can see here this is for the uh it looks like yeah this so this is for looks like yeah this so this is for looks like yeah this so this is for Kubernetes itself. Okay. Um you can see what itself. Okay. Um you can see what itself. Okay. Um you can see what software for example has software for example has software for example has salsa. salsa. salsa. Um yeah so you can see what you know Um yeah so you can see what you know Um yeah so you can see what you know this in this case this query uh talks this in this case this query uh talks this in this case this query uh talks about which um software has salsa. Uh about which um software has salsa. Uh about which um software has salsa. Uh you can ask all sorts of other stuff you can ask all sorts of other stuff you can ask all sorts of other stuff about license information um about about license information um about about license information um about vulnerability informationation about vulnerability informationation about vulnerability informationation about patch planning as well. So you can patch planning as well. So you can patch planning as well. So you can actually ask it to give you if you know actually ask it to give you if you know actually ask it to give you if you know that this thing has a vulnerability that this thing has a vulnerability that this thing has a vulnerability based on what's in guac you can go and based on what's in guac you can go and based on what's in guac you can go and pull out um you can go and pull out uh pull out um you can go and pull out uh pull out um you can go and pull out uh that as that as that as well. Um so next steps hey always well. Um so next steps hey always well. Um so next steps hey always looking for more contributors and users. looking for more contributors and users. looking for more contributors and users. Um there's need for more tools and Um there's need for more tools and Um there's need for more tools and integrations in the supply chain space. integrations in the supply chain space. integrations in the supply chain space. uh we're moving towards probably uh we're moving towards probably uh we're moving towards probably something that a few of us like to call something that a few of us like to call something that a few of us like to call the SDLC control plane or supply chain the SDLC control plane or supply chain the SDLC control plane or supply chain control plane. This need for managing control plane. This need for managing control plane. This need for managing state across your entire you know state across your entire you know state across your entire you know ecosystem of everything you're pulling ecosystem of everything you're pulling ecosystem of everything you're pulling in. The same way that Kubernetes in. The same way that Kubernetes in. The same way that Kubernetes orchestrates workloads, we need to have orchestrates workloads, we need to have orchestrates workloads, we need to have some concept even if it's just purely an some concept even if it's just purely an some concept even if it's just purely an abstraction that is what are we pulling abstraction that is what are we pulling abstraction that is what are we pulling into our uh ecosystem and um you know into our uh ecosystem and um you know into our uh ecosystem and um you know are we controlling to make sure yes it's are we controlling to make sure yes it's are we controlling to make sure yes it's being built in the right way yes only being built in the right way yes only being built in the right way yes only approved developers are allowed to approved developers are allowed to approved developers are allowed to develop there and only approved uh develop there and only approved uh develop there and only approved uh projects are allowed to be pulled into projects are allowed to be pulled into projects are allowed to be pulled into my supply chain. Well anyway that's what my supply chain. Well anyway that's what my supply chain. Well anyway that's what I have uh and I think we have like a I have uh and I think we have like a I have uh and I think we have like a couple of minutes for questions. Yeah. Okay. Hey Mike, thanks for the talk. This was Hey Mike, thanks for the talk. This was Hey Mike, thanks for the talk. This was great. I love the idea of the sandwich great. I love the idea of the sandwich great. I love the idea of the sandwich and um I personally know guac is a is a and um I personally know guac is a is a and um I personally know guac is a is a great tool. So, this great great great tool. So, this great great great tool. So, this great great presentation. Um, you mentioned S2C2F a presentation. Um, you mentioned S2C2F a presentation. Um, you mentioned S2C2F a couple of times. Yes. And I was couple of times. Yes. And I was couple of times. Yes. And I was wondering if you could kind of what does wondering if you could kind of what does wondering if you could kind of what does that stand for and how might a an that stand for and how might a an that stand for and how might a an organization or an enterprise use that organization or an enterprise use that organization or an enterprise use that to kind of frame out different types of to kind of frame out different types of to kind of frame out different types of attacks, how to prevent them, align to attacks, how to prevent them, align to attacks, how to prevent them, align to controls. I know that's been helpful for controls. I know that's been helpful for controls. I know that's been helpful for me. Yep. You could call that out. I I me. Yep. You could call that out. I I me. Yep. You could call that out. I I think that'd be great. Yeah. So, what's think that'd be great. Yeah. So, what's think that'd be great. Yeah. So, what's great about S2C2F is a set of rules for great about S2C2F is a set of rules for great about S2C2F is a set of rules for consuming software. So if you think consuming software. So if you think consuming software. So if you think about baseline and salsa about securely about baseline and salsa about securely about baseline and salsa about securely producing software, S2C2F is like producing software, S2C2F is like producing software, S2C2F is like essentially what do I do to consume it? essentially what do I do to consume it? essentially what do I do to consume it? And some of it can be consume projects And some of it can be consume projects And some of it can be consume projects that look at baseline. Um if those that look at baseline. Um if those that look at baseline. Um if those projects are not using baseline, well projects are not using baseline, well projects are not using baseline, well maybe what I should do is rebuild that maybe what I should do is rebuild that maybe what I should do is rebuild that software software software internally, do various scans and those internally, do various scans and those internally, do various scans and those sorts of things. So that's kind of where sorts of things. So that's kind of where sorts of things. So that's kind of where um a lot of that is in there and I would um a lot of that is in there and I would um a lot of that is in there and I would recommend checking out S2C2F which will recommend checking out S2C2F which will recommend checking out S2C2F which will soon actually become part of Salsa. So soon actually become part of Salsa. So soon actually become part of Salsa. So you'll actually have a full sort of you'll actually have a full sort of you'll actually have a full sort of holistic picture in the in the Salsa holistic picture in the in the Salsa holistic picture in the in the Salsa project. project. project. Thanks for the presentation, Mike. I am Thanks for the presentation, Mike. I am Thanks for the presentation, Mike. I am now very hungry. So I'm angry about that now very hungry. So I'm angry about that now very hungry. So I'm angry about that now. But uh a question that you now. But uh a question that you now. But uh a question that you mentioned a ton of these great tools. if mentioned a ton of these great tools. if mentioned a ton of these great tools. if I was interested in using it or want to I was interested in using it or want to I was interested in using it or want to learn more about it, what's the best way learn more about it, what's the best way learn more about it, what's the best way somebody could get engaged with like somebody could get engaged with like somebody could get engaged with like understanding how do I can use block? understanding how do I can use block? understanding how do I can use block? How do I get in touch with folks and How do I get in touch with folks and How do I get in touch with folks and maybe contribute? Yep. Um, opensf.org. I maybe contribute? Yep. Um, opensf.org. I maybe contribute? Yep. Um, opensf.org. I think that's probably the first place to think that's probably the first place to think that's probably the first place to go. We have a calendar. We have all go. We have a calendar. We have all go. We have a calendar. We have all sorts of stuff. There's a lot of GitHub sorts of stuff. There's a lot of GitHub sorts of stuff. There's a lot of GitHub projects. Um, some of the ones I I projects. Um, some of the ones I I projects. Um, some of the ones I I already brought up today. Feel free to already brought up today. Feel free to already brought up today. Feel free to to Google them, check it all out, and to Google them, check it all out, and to Google them, check it all out, and and come join us.
