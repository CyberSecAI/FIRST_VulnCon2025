Um, Um, Um, so yeah, I'm really excited to be here. so yeah, I'm really excited to be here. so yeah, I'm really excited to be here. My name is Roy. I actually just uh flew My name is Roy. I actually just uh flew My name is Roy. I actually just uh flew in from Portland this morning. Uh, so in from Portland this morning. Uh, so in from Portland this morning. Uh, so it's nice to see rain and hot weather at it's nice to see rain and hot weather at it's nice to see rain and hot weather at the same time. the same time. the same time. Um, yeah. So um this talk you know the Um, yeah. So um this talk you know the Um, yeah. So um this talk you know the the title is nice and everything and and the title is nice and everything and and the title is nice and everything and and a bit about myself um now I work for a bit about myself um now I work for a bit about myself um now I work for codm security we're application security codm security we're application security codm security we're application security company we are focused on runtime doing company we are focused on runtime doing company we are focused on runtime doing sea and SAS but my talk today is going sea and SAS but my talk today is going sea and SAS but my talk today is going to be focusing on my experience in NSO to be focusing on my experience in NSO to be focusing on my experience in NSO group so just to like gauge the room group so just to like gauge the room group so just to like gauge the room like how many people are familiar with like how many people are familiar with like how many people are familiar with NSO group. NSO group. NSO group. Okay, perfect. So, uh I will share Okay, perfect. So, uh I will share Okay, perfect. So, uh I will share something new with uh uh with a lot of something new with uh uh with a lot of something new with uh uh with a lot of people. So, um NSO Group is a cyber people. So, um NSO Group is a cyber people. So, um NSO Group is a cyber offensive company. It's most famous for offensive company. It's most famous for offensive company. It's most famous for Pegasus. Uh so, maybe Pegasus more Pegasus. Uh so, maybe Pegasus more Pegasus. Uh so, maybe Pegasus more people are familiar with. Um Pegasus is people are familiar with. Um Pegasus is people are familiar with. Um Pegasus is a spyware. Um, essentially, a spyware. Um, essentially, a spyware. Um, essentially, um, the goal of Ferris was to be able to um, the goal of Ferris was to be able to um, the goal of Ferris was to be able to break into phones, mobile phones, uh, break into phones, mobile phones, uh, break into phones, mobile phones, uh, iPhones and, uh, Android iPhones and, uh, Android iPhones and, uh, Android devices. Um, and what I'm going to share devices. Um, and what I'm going to share devices. Um, and what I'm going to share with you is some of the experience from with you is some of the experience from with you is some of the experience from the attackers p perspective, what we can the attackers p perspective, what we can the attackers p perspective, what we can learn about it as we are trying to learn about it as we are trying to learn about it as we are trying to secure and defend our application and secure and defend our application and secure and defend our application and what we tried to take into code. them what we tried to take into code. them what we tried to take into code. them when we started building the product and when we started building the product and when we started building the product and everything. everything. everything. So, as I mentioned, Pegasus is So, as I mentioned, Pegasus is So, as I mentioned, Pegasus is a spyware. Uh, it broke phones. Uh, but a spyware. Uh, it broke phones. Uh, but a spyware. Uh, it broke phones. Uh, but it essentially did compete with top it essentially did compete with top it essentially did compete with top security teams. Okay. Competed with security teams. Okay. Competed with security teams. Okay. Competed with enterprise security teams. So, I think enterprise security teams. So, I think enterprise security teams. So, I think the the lessons and what we were trying the the lessons and what we were trying the the lessons and what we were trying to achieve and do was mainly to compete to achieve and do was mainly to compete to achieve and do was mainly to compete with those team, those security teams. with those team, those security teams. with those team, those security teams. So that's how from the other side or the So that's how from the other side or the So that's how from the other side or the other perspective of what you are trying other perspective of what you are trying other perspective of what you are trying to defend uh from. So just want to dive to defend uh from. So just want to dive to defend uh from. So just want to dive into the key learnings that we have uh into the key learnings that we have uh into the key learnings that we have uh and please feel free to stop me during and please feel free to stop me during and please feel free to stop me during the the talk ask question we can make it the the talk ask question we can make it the the talk ask question we can make it interactive like feel absolutely free. Um perfect. So maybe before we dive in. Um perfect. So maybe before we dive in. Um perfect. So maybe before we dive in. So how many people here are like So how many people here are like So how many people here are like security people s application security people s application security people s application security. Okay. Ah okay. Uh do we have security. Okay. Ah okay. Uh do we have security. Okay. Ah okay. Uh do we have developers or engineers developers or engineers developers or engineers on perfect okay so so we keep it on perfect okay so so we keep it on perfect okay so so we keep it uh uh uh cool. Um perfect. So this is a general cool. Um perfect. So this is a general cool. Um perfect. So this is a general distribution of vulnerabilities. Okay. distribution of vulnerabilities. Okay. distribution of vulnerabilities. Okay. So the numbers are constantly changing So the numbers are constantly changing So the numbers are constantly changing because every day we have like thousand because every day we have like thousand because every day we have like thousand new vulnerabilities. But what pops out new vulnerabilities. But what pops out new vulnerabilities. But what pops out here is actually the distribution and here is actually the distribution and here is actually the distribution and you can see here like pretty clearly you can see here like pretty clearly you can see here like pretty clearly that medium and low that medium and low that medium and low vulnerabilities there are tons of them. vulnerabilities there are tons of them. vulnerabilities there are tons of them. Uh they're really really really tons of Uh they're really really really tons of Uh they're really really really tons of them. them. them. Now the it's the it's a snapshot like I the it's the it's a snapshot like I the it's the it's a snapshot like I think six months ago uh that we took think six months ago uh that we took think six months ago uh that we took it's like we we we checked it on NVD and it's like we we we checked it on NVD and it's like we we we checked it on NVD and GitHub GitHub GitHub advisory and that's the um so it's a you can think of it as a um so it's a you can think of it as a um so it's a you can think of it as a day we can do it again today and the day we can do it again today and the day we can do it again today and the number will change a bit but number will change a bit but number will change a bit but distribution will be pretty much the distribution will be pretty much the distribution will be pretty much the same. Yeah. Yeah. Um so yeah sure I okay I understand that so yeah sure I okay I understand that so yeah sure I okay I understand that the time frame where you collected those the time frame where you collected those the time frame where you collected those number of vulnerabilities is that over number of vulnerabilities is that over number of vulnerabilities is that over six months 12 months or what? So so it's six months 12 months or what? So so it's six months 12 months or what? So so it's about six months. Yeah. Okay. about six months. Yeah. Okay. about six months. Yeah. Okay. Thanks. Perfect. Um, so when we started Thanks. Perfect. Um, so when we started Thanks. Perfect. Um, so when we started working and and trying to look into uh working and and trying to look into uh working and and trying to look into uh vulnerabilities and analyzing the vulnerabilities and analyzing the vulnerabilities and analyzing the software, uh, we we understood that we software, uh, we we understood that we software, uh, we we understood that we are competing with other teams, other are competing with other teams, other are competing with other teams, other humans. Okay. And most organization they humans. Okay. And most organization they humans. Okay. And most organization they are focusing their efforts on the are focusing their efforts on the are focusing their efforts on the critical and highs, right? Most of us critical and highs, right? Most of us critical and highs, right? Most of us the SLAs's on the critical and the the SLAs's on the critical and the the SLAs's on the critical and the highs. H. And then we also like get the highs. H. And then we also like get the highs. H. And then we also like get the the the understanding that SLAs's means the the understanding that SLAs's means the the understanding that SLAs's means more time for medium and low. So if I'm more time for medium and low. So if I'm more time for medium and low. So if I'm able to exploit a medium vulnerability able to exploit a medium vulnerability able to exploit a medium vulnerability and to actually make it work, it will and to actually make it work, it will and to actually make it work, it will stay there longer. Okay. So as we as an stay there longer. Okay. So as we as an stay there longer. Okay. So as we as an attacker try to attacker try to attacker try to productize productize productize vulnerabilities, we want them to be vulnerabilities, we want them to be vulnerabilities, we want them to be there as much time as possible. Okay. So there as much time as possible. Okay. So there as much time as possible. Okay. So those SLAs's and this distribution make those SLAs's and this distribution make those SLAs's and this distribution make it easier to us to try to exploit it easier to us to try to exploit it easier to us to try to exploit mediums. Also something interesting mediums. Also something interesting mediums. Also something interesting about the distribution like severities about the distribution like severities about the distribution like severities are um mostly based on CVSS obviously are um mostly based on CVSS obviously are um mostly based on CVSS obviously and CVSS is not necessarily a tailored and CVSS is not necessarily a tailored and CVSS is not necessarily a tailored score to your environment. Okay, it score to your environment. Okay, it score to your environment. Okay, it lacks some context some understanding lacks some context some understanding lacks some context some understanding about the specific use of the about the specific use of the about the specific use of the application and the specific use uh of application and the specific use uh of application and the specific use uh of the environment on the on the the environment on the on the the environment on the on the vulnerability itself. So we will vulnerability itself. So we will vulnerability itself. So we will actually see how those scoring and actually see how those scoring and actually see how those scoring and SLAs's can come handy to an to an SLAs's can come handy to an to an SLAs's can come handy to an to an attacker. The second thing that it's attacker. The second thing that it's attacker. The second thing that it's interesting about like attacking a interesting about like attacking a interesting about like attacking a system that it's usually it's not a system that it's usually it's not a system that it's usually it's not a single vulnerability. Okay, we need to single vulnerability. Okay, we need to single vulnerability. Okay, we need to create like a chain of multiple create like a chain of multiple create like a chain of multiple vulnerabilities in order to actually vulnerabilities in order to actually vulnerabilities in order to actually exploit a system. So exploit a system. So exploit a system. So uh ju just trying to make it like uh ju just trying to make it like uh ju just trying to make it like concrete. So we need to get to the the concrete. So we need to get to the the concrete. So we need to get to the the application, we need to privilege application, we need to privilege application, we need to privilege escalation, uh we need to get the data escalation, uh we need to get the data escalation, uh we need to get the data back. Usually each vulnerability is just back. Usually each vulnerability is just back. Usually each vulnerability is just a single step in towards the a single step in towards the a single step in towards the goal. Uh and of course there's log forj, goal. Uh and of course there's log forj, goal. Uh and of course there's log forj, there are nextjs vulnerabilities, some there are nextjs vulnerabilities, some there are nextjs vulnerabilities, some some of the vulnerabilities are really some of the vulnerabilities are really some of the vulnerabilities are really really explosive. Uh but most of them really explosive. Uh but most of them really explosive. Uh but most of them are not. are not. are not. Um and then we we started to look at the Um and then we we started to look at the Um and then we we started to look at the tools like what are the security tools tools like what are the security tools tools like what are the security tools that all the the companies use. So most that all the the companies use. So most that all the the companies use. So most of them they are noisy right when you of them they are noisy right when you of them they are noisy right when you connect a new security tool you get connect a new security tool you get connect a new security tool you get thousands of vulnerabilities thousands of vulnerabilities thousands of vulnerabilities immediately. So you start with a a immediately. So you start with a a immediately. So you start with a a backlog of like 20,000 30,000 backlog of like 20,000 30,000 backlog of like 20,000 30,000 vulnerabilities. The second you connect vulnerabilities. The second you connect vulnerabilities. The second you connect to them it's hard to to like be on top to them it's hard to to like be on top to them it's hard to to like be on top of everything. The second thing is we of everything. The second thing is we of everything. The second thing is we use a lot of tools. Uh and every tool is use a lot of tools. Uh and every tool is use a lot of tools. Uh and every tool is like niching on something. So we have an like niching on something. So we have an like niching on something. So we have an application security tool, we have a application security tool, we have a application security tool, we have a CSPM, we have w and everyone grades the CSPM, we have w and everyone grades the CSPM, we have w and everyone grades the the vulnerability based on what they the vulnerability based on what they the vulnerability based on what they know and what they look at. So you have know and what they look at. So you have know and what they look at. So you have a lot of critical, a lot of eyes in a lot of critical, a lot of eyes in a lot of critical, a lot of eyes in every different aspect and every tool every different aspect and every tool every different aspect and every tool wants you to handle his own or or his wants you to handle his own or or his wants you to handle his own or or his part of the part of the part of the world. And the third thing it's also um world. And the third thing it's also um world. And the third thing it's also um uh kind uh kind uh kind of like complemented to the to the a lot of like complemented to the to the a lot of like complemented to the to the a lot of tools. They're very narrow. They they of tools. They're very narrow. They they of tools. They're very narrow. They they look on a specific application. They look on a specific application. They look on a specific application. They look on a specific uh type of software look on a specific uh type of software look on a specific uh type of software and they cannot like give you the full and they cannot like give you the full and they cannot like give you the full context or the full uh view of your context or the full uh view of your context or the full uh view of your entire environment. entire environment. entire environment. Um so any question around like Cool. So what can we do? Uh and when we Cool. So what can we do? Uh and when we Cool. So what can we do? Uh and when we look at those thing those things um it's look at those thing those things um it's look at those thing those things um it's pretty hard. So the first thing I think pretty hard. So the first thing I think pretty hard. So the first thing I think and I it's actually cool because I met and I it's actually cool because I met and I it's actually cool because I met someone from uh from MITER earlier someone from uh from MITER earlier someone from uh from MITER earlier today. Uh but it's to start and have a today. Uh but it's to start and have a today. Uh but it's to start and have a common language and common understanding common language and common understanding common language and common understanding of what attackers actually tries to do. of what attackers actually tries to do. of what attackers actually tries to do. So the mighty attack framework help us So the mighty attack framework help us So the mighty attack framework help us by setting those tactic and techniques by setting those tactic and techniques by setting those tactic and techniques uh and and give us common language to uh and and give us common language to uh and and give us common language to understand actually what are the goals understand actually what are the goals understand actually what are the goals what are the attackers trying to do and what are the attackers trying to do and what are the attackers trying to do and when we start like this is an example when we start like this is an example when we start like this is an example from from miter itself but it's all from from miter itself but it's all from from miter itself but it's all sorts of different uh different things sorts of different uh different things sorts of different uh different things uh that we try to achieve when you uh that we try to achieve when you uh that we try to achieve when you exploit a system and having this common exploit a system and having this common exploit a system and having this common language being able to think like an language being able to think like an language being able to think like an attacker meaning that we are able to attacker meaning that we are able to attacker meaning that we are able to track things that attackers tries to do. track things that attackers tries to do. track things that attackers tries to do. Um and when we start like looking at Um and when we start like looking at Um and when we start like looking at vulnerabilities so you you you you start vulnerabilities so you you you you start vulnerabilities so you you you you start with a big pile right some of them are with a big pile right some of them are with a big pile right some of them are critical some of them are high you start critical some of them are high you start critical some of them are high you start with a big pile when you try to with a big pile when you try to with a big pile when you try to understand like what exactly can I use understand like what exactly can I use understand like what exactly can I use each vulnerability for. So what an each vulnerability for. So what an each vulnerability for. So what an attacker can use this vulnerability for attacker can use this vulnerability for attacker can use this vulnerability for you can start you can start you can start uh building a chain. So this is an uh building a chain. So this is an uh building a chain. So this is an example of a chain and and we will I example of a chain and and we will I example of a chain and and we will I want to highlight a few points here but want to highlight a few points here but want to highlight a few points here but you can see you can see you can see uh again that we have multiple uh again that we have multiple uh again that we have multiple vulnerabilities in the in the chain some vulnerabilities in the in the chain some vulnerabilities in the in the chain some of them are critical some of them are of them are critical some of them are of them are critical some of them are medium this is colorcoded I don't know medium this is colorcoded I don't know medium this is colorcoded I don't know if you see that the back but what we can if you see that the back but what we can if you see that the back but what we can also see is that when we we start also see is that when we we start also see is that when we we start talking about the chain so I can tell talking about the chain so I can tell talking about the chain so I can tell you this chain is a credential you this chain is a credential you this chain is a credential excfiltration I'm able to build a story excfiltration I'm able to build a story excfiltration I'm able to build a story around the chain and and I'm able to around the chain and and I'm able to around the chain and and I'm able to communicate it with other people in the communicate it with other people in the communicate it with other people in the organization. So being able to build a organization. So being able to build a organization. So being able to build a story uh around why this vulnerability story uh around why this vulnerability story uh around why this vulnerability is important, why this fixing is is important, why this fixing is is important, why this fixing is important also when we look in on important also when we look in on important also when we look in on chains. So eventually you know we want chains. So eventually you know we want chains. So eventually you know we want the cheese. Um so so when we start we the cheese. Um so so when we start we the cheese. Um so so when we start we start with initial access somewhere and start with initial access somewhere and start with initial access somewhere and then we start going forward. So some of then we start going forward. So some of then we start going forward. So some of the vulnerabilities will be in multiple the vulnerabilities will be in multiple the vulnerabilities will be in multiple chains, right? So maybe they're more chains, right? So maybe they're more chains, right? So maybe they're more important. Uh some of them has has a important. Uh some of them has has a important. Uh some of them has has a fix, some of them doesn't. Okay? So if fix, some of them doesn't. Okay? So if fix, some of them doesn't. Okay? So if I'm able to break somewhere some of the I'm able to break somewhere some of the I'm able to break somewhere some of the vulnerabilities, I'm effectively vulnerabilities, I'm effectively vulnerabilities, I'm effectively breaking the chain. So it allows me to breaking the chain. So it allows me to breaking the chain. So it allows me to take a proactive approach even though take a proactive approach even though take a proactive approach even though not all the vulnerabilities over here not all the vulnerabilities over here not all the vulnerabilities over here are fixable. Maybe some of the chains are fixable. Maybe some of the chains are fixable. Maybe some of the chains are fixable and are preventable. So it are fixable and are preventable. So it are fixable and are preventable. So it allows us to take like a a an a not not allows us to take like a a an a not not allows us to take like a a an a not not necessarily better but a new approach necessarily better but a new approach necessarily better but a new approach toward prioritiz priority hard word but toward prioritiz priority hard word but toward prioritiz priority hard word but prioritize tell me tell thank you. So it prioritize tell me tell thank you. So it prioritize tell me tell thank you. So it allows us to do the word and uh like allows us to do the word and uh like allows us to do the word and uh like being more effective and being more being more effective and being more being more effective and being more proactive with those with those kind of proactive with those with those kind of proactive with those with those kind of things. things. things. So I think that the the the main concept So I think that the the the main concept So I think that the the the main concept here is that we need to look at chains here is that we need to look at chains here is that we need to look at chains as a as a baseline to understand the as a as a baseline to understand the as a as a baseline to understand the actual risk for your environment. So two actual risk for your environment. So two actual risk for your environment. So two mediums can be critical when chained mediums can be critical when chained mediums can be critical when chained together and bunch of critical if they together and bunch of critical if they together and bunch of critical if they they are like on an island and they can they are like on an island and they can they are like on an island and they can do anything they're not necessarily as do anything they're not necessarily as do anything they're not necessarily as urgent for your application at the urgent for your application at the urgent for your application at the moment. Uh so it allows us to really moment. Uh so it allows us to really moment. Uh so it allows us to really think um about effectively uh think um about effectively uh think um about effectively uh remediating and improving the posture remediating and improving the posture remediating and improving the posture score. Um so like technically how how can we Um so like technically how how can we Um so like technically how how can we start uh start doing those things and start uh start doing those things and start uh start doing those things and and and maybe like a word before like and and maybe like a word before like and and maybe like a word before like what we were trying to do uh with what we were trying to do uh with what we were trying to do uh with Pegasus and and why chains are such a Pegasus and and why chains are such a Pegasus and and why chains are such a powerful tools in our opinion. So as I powerful tools in our opinion. So as I powerful tools in our opinion. So as I was saying before we we are trying to was saying before we we are trying to was saying before we we are trying to create the story. The story is something create the story. The story is something create the story. The story is something very very like effective and strong and very very like effective and strong and very very like effective and strong and we used it in Pegasus to teach each we used it in Pegasus to teach each we used it in Pegasus to teach each other uh like about uh about the tools other uh like about uh about the tools other uh like about uh about the tools about the chains about everything. So about the chains about everything. So about the chains about everything. So this kind of view and being able to find this kind of view and being able to find this kind of view and being able to find like a medium vulnerability that is you like a medium vulnerability that is you like a medium vulnerability that is you know perfect for us for our use case it know perfect for us for our use case it know perfect for us for our use case it was a big win. We also uh we were also was a big win. We also uh we were also was a big win. We also uh we were also able to um do what we call like able to um do what we call like able to um do what we call like expanding the vulnerability. So usually expanding the vulnerability. So usually expanding the vulnerability. So usually when we find a vulnerability we could when we find a vulnerability we could when we find a vulnerability we could have we could find adjacent have we could find adjacent have we could find adjacent vulnerabilities which are practically vulnerabilities which are practically vulnerabilities which are practically the same. It can be because it's the the same. It can be because it's the the same. It can be because it's the same people that wrote the code. It can same people that wrote the code. It can same people that wrote the code. It can be because it's the same component. Uh be because it's the same component. Uh be because it's the same component. Uh so they're also sort of thing and then so they're also sort of thing and then so they're also sort of thing and then those vulnerability will also be those vulnerability will also be those vulnerability will also be classified as medium classified as medium classified as medium probably but they're not disclosed yet. probably but they're not disclosed yet. probably but they're not disclosed yet. So when they will be disclosed I can So when they will be disclosed I can So when they will be disclosed I can assume I can prepare like ahead of time assume I can prepare like ahead of time assume I can prepare like ahead of time because I know those SLA ahead of time. because I know those SLA ahead of time. because I know those SLA ahead of time. Um, so it really allows me as an Um, so it really allows me as an Um, so it really allows me as an attacker to exploit the way that the attacker to exploit the way that the attacker to exploit the way that the organization work and think not only organization work and think not only organization work and think not only being able to exploit the application being able to exploit the application being able to exploit the application but exploit the workflow of the but exploit the workflow of the but exploit the workflow of the organization. organization. organization. Um, so what what can we do and how can Um, so what what can we do and how can Um, so what what can we do and how can we start to think on our organization we start to think on our organization we start to think on our organization this way uh from the attacker lens. So this way uh from the attacker lens. So this way uh from the attacker lens. So the first thing is making an inventory. the first thing is making an inventory. the first thing is making an inventory. So it sounds simple in theory but we So it sounds simple in theory but we So it sounds simple in theory but we have tons of stuff right we have have tons of stuff right we have have tons of stuff right we have containers we have EM we have legacy containers we have EM we have legacy containers we have EM we have legacy software we have cloud software like software we have cloud software like software we have cloud software like third parties what whatever so that we third parties what whatever so that we third parties what whatever so that we need to understand what we have the need to understand what we have the need to understand what we have the second thing that is important to second thing that is important to second thing that is important to understand is mitigations mitigations understand is mitigations mitigations understand is mitigations mitigations are usually like the the the attacker's are usually like the the the attacker's are usually like the the the attacker's worst nightmare like being able to worst nightmare like being able to worst nightmare like being able to mitigate with for example w rules or you mitigate with for example w rules or you mitigate with for example w rules or you know doesn't really matter know doesn't really matter know doesn't really matter It's very powerful and it's very hard to It's very powerful and it's very hard to It's very powerful and it's very hard to go through. So understanding the go through. So understanding the go through. So understanding the mitigation will allow you to understand mitigation will allow you to understand mitigation will allow you to understand how your prioritization should be or how your prioritization should be or how your prioritization should be or your own organization should be. And the your own organization should be. And the your own organization should be. And the last thing is really start to develop last thing is really start to develop last thing is really start to develop this like thinking of chains like it's this like thinking of chains like it's this like thinking of chains like it's not an individual uh vulnerability it's not an individual uh vulnerability it's not an individual uh vulnerability it's what I want to do with those couple of what I want to do with those couple of what I want to do with those couple of vulnerability together. Um, and I just vulnerability together. Um, and I just vulnerability together. Um, and I just want to shout out a few tools, open want to shout out a few tools, open want to shout out a few tools, open source tools that you can all like start source tools that you can all like start source tools that you can all like start using today. So there's team pipe. Um, using today. So there's team pipe. Um, using today. So there's team pipe. Um, it's a tspql tool. So you can just qu it's a tspql tool. So you can just qu it's a tspql tool. So you can just qu your cloud provider. It's pretty your cloud provider. It's pretty your cloud provider. It's pretty agnostic with SQL. You have sift which agnostic with SQL. You have sift which agnostic with SQL. You have sift which is an amazing sbomb software and sea. is an amazing sbomb software and sea. is an amazing sbomb software and sea. It's a software composition analysis. It's a software composition analysis. It's a software composition analysis. Also great. Open grip is the pork of sam Also great. Open grip is the pork of sam Also great. Open grip is the pork of sam grip. Um, and of course now with AI, I I grip. Um, and of course now with AI, I I grip. Um, and of course now with AI, I I put it the hacking phase. You can use put it the hacking phase. You can use put it the hacking phase. You can use any AI providers that your organization any AI providers that your organization any AI providers that your organization allow you to, but open source uh allow you to, but open source uh allow you to, but open source uh um and AI specifically can really help um and AI specifically can really help um and AI specifically can really help you like train models for this specific you like train models for this specific you like train models for this specific use case. really fine-tune the models to use case. really fine-tune the models to use case. really fine-tune the models to talk about vulnerabilities chain, talk about vulnerabilities chain, talk about vulnerabilities chain, explain you what the vulnerabilities are explain you what the vulnerabilities are explain you what the vulnerabilities are and connect between a vulnerability and and connect between a vulnerability and and connect between a vulnerability and a technique or tactic with the mitro a technique or tactic with the mitro a technique or tactic with the mitro tech like automatically. Uh and tech like automatically. Uh and tech like automatically. Uh and obviously like tons of vulnerability um obviously like tons of vulnerability um obviously like tons of vulnerability um database out there. OSV have also a database out there. OSV have also a database out there. OSV have also a graph database uh which can be very very graph database uh which can be very very graph database uh which can be very very useful uh when thinking about chains. useful uh when thinking about chains. useful uh when thinking about chains. Um Um Um so quick summary um before we go into so quick summary um before we go into so quick summary um before we go into the the questions. the the questions. the the questions. Um the first thing I think it's more Um the first thing I think it's more Um the first thing I think it's more more most important is that as an more most important is that as an more most important is that as an attacker you take what you got you take attacker you take what you got you take attacker you take what you got you take what you have right you don't wait to what you have right you don't wait to what you have right you don't wait to that for the perfect thing you take what that for the perfect thing you take what that for the perfect thing you take what you have in front of you and you try to you have in front of you and you try to you have in front of you and you try to uh to look on everything you don't just uh to look on everything you don't just uh to look on everything you don't just look at every application individually. look at every application individually. look at every application individually. You do it obviously but you look at the You do it obviously but you look at the You do it obviously but you look at the entire system at the entire platform and entire system at the entire platform and entire system at the entire platform and start to to to find these mini holes start to to to find these mini holes start to to to find these mini holes that you can go and weave your way that you can go and weave your way that you can go and weave your way through. Okay. So we take an holistic through. Okay. So we take an holistic through. Okay. So we take an holistic approach as an attackers. Um and it's approach as an attackers. Um and it's approach as an attackers. Um and it's really important to to look at those really important to to look at those really important to to look at those application as a complex. application as a complex. application as a complex. Um the third thing is that most Um the third thing is that most Um the third thing is that most vulnerabilities need to be chained vulnerabilities need to be chained vulnerabilities need to be chained together in order to be effectively together in order to be effectively together in order to be effectively exploited and effectively exploited for exploited and effectively exploited for exploited and effectively exploited for long period of time. uh when we have long period of time. uh when we have long period of time. uh when we have chains with small vulnerabilities, we chains with small vulnerabilities, we chains with small vulnerabilities, we can usually create backup uh for part of can usually create backup uh for part of can usually create backup uh for part of the chain allowing us to be able to to the chain allowing us to be able to to the chain allowing us to be able to to to get to market as fast as possible. So to get to market as fast as possible. So to get to market as fast as possible. So again, when we talk about like companies again, when we talk about like companies again, when we talk about like companies like NSO, we have a product, we want to like NSO, we have a product, we want to like NSO, we have a product, we want to get with with our product as fast as get with with our product as fast as get with with our product as fast as possible to the market. And it means possible to the market. And it means possible to the market. And it means that when that when that when Apple like sends a new iOS update, we Apple like sends a new iOS update, we Apple like sends a new iOS update, we want to be able to exploit this version want to be able to exploit this version want to be able to exploit this version the next day. Uh so we are able to do it the next day. Uh so we are able to do it the next day. Uh so we are able to do it with a lot of vulnerabilities and with a with a lot of vulnerabilities and with a with a lot of vulnerabilities and with a lot of backups to those lot of backups to those lot of backups to those vulnerabilities. And the next one is is vulnerabilities. And the next one is is vulnerabilities. And the next one is is again I'm going to emphasize it that the again I'm going to emphasize it that the again I'm going to emphasize it that the chain creates a story. Story is chain creates a story. Story is chain creates a story. Story is something that we are able like most of something that we are able like most of something that we are able like most of the hands here was application security the hands here was application security the hands here was application security guys. Um, so chain allows us to create a guys. Um, so chain allows us to create a guys. Um, so chain allows us to create a story to create the story inside the story to create the story inside the story to create the story inside the organization to be able to do a better organization to be able to do a better organization to be able to do a better handoff handoff handoff with with ourselves and the uh with with ourselves and the uh with with ourselves and the uh developers and any other position in the developers and any other position in the developers and any other position in the organization that is interested in those organization that is interested in those organization that is interested in those things. Uh so it's really powerful to things. Uh so it's really powerful to things. Uh so it's really powerful to talk about it and to like shed some give talk about it and to like shed some give talk about it and to like shed some give some color to everything that we uh we some color to everything that we uh we some color to everything that we uh we do in communicate. do in communicate. do in communicate. Um yeah, you know, in Sunsu it's always Um yeah, you know, in Sunsu it's always Um yeah, you know, in Sunsu it's always good to put him in good to put him in good to put him in a attacking stuff, but but but really a attacking stuff, but but but really a attacking stuff, but but but really it's it's it's about the it's know your it's it's it's about the it's know your it's it's it's about the it's know your enemy. It's the first part that everyone enemy. It's the first part that everyone enemy. It's the first part that everyone know, but the second part of the code is know, but the second part of the code is know, but the second part of the code is know yourself. Um and it's and it's the know yourself. Um and it's and it's the know yourself. Um and it's and it's the essentially the biggest leverage that or essentially the biggest leverage that or essentially the biggest leverage that or um advantage that you have over the um advantage that you have over the um advantage that you have over the attackers that you have first party attackers that you have first party attackers that you have first party access to all your infrastructure, code access to all your infrastructure, code access to all your infrastructure, code and people. Um it's something that and people. Um it's something that and people. Um it's something that attackers that looks on the system from attackers that looks on the system from attackers that looks on the system from the outside obviously lack. Um and the outside obviously lack. Um and the outside obviously lack. Um and it's you can you can put it to work very it's you can you can put it to work very it's you can you can put it to work very effectively uh in your environment. So effectively uh in your environment. So effectively uh in your environment. So let's go questions. Yeah. No. Great question. questions. Yeah. No. Great question. questions. Yeah. No. Great question. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Maybe we have a question back here. Maybe we have a question back here. Maybe we have a question back here. Great talk. Thank you. Um, as a user, Great talk. Thank you. Um, as a user, Great talk. Thank you. Um, as a user, where do we get information on v where do we get information on v where do we get information on v vulnerability chains? What I've seen is vulnerability chains? What I've seen is vulnerability chains? What I've seen is I agree with what you're saying, but I agree with what you're saying, but I agree with what you're saying, but it's very hard to get info on this CVE it's very hard to get info on this CVE it's very hard to get info on this CVE or vulnerabilities chain of that one. or vulnerabilities chain of that one. or vulnerabilities chain of that one. So, but it all makes sense practically. So, but it all makes sense practically. So, but it all makes sense practically. What can we do to get the chaining data What can we do to get the chaining data What can we do to get the chaining data that we can mitigate it? So, chaining is that we can mitigate it? So, chaining is that we can mitigate it? So, chaining is obviously it's hard like people work on obviously it's hard like people work on obviously it's hard like people work on it full-time. I think that the pract the it full-time. I think that the pract the it full-time. I think that the pract the practical thing to start with is practical thing to start with is practical thing to start with is understanding how to understanding how to understanding how to um put labels on vulnerabilities and um put labels on vulnerabilities and um put labels on vulnerabilities and once you have those labels like what once you have those labels like what once you have those labels like what tactic or technique those v this tactic or technique those v this tactic or technique those v this vulnerability if you go to the mitro vulnerability if you go to the mitro vulnerability if you go to the mitro attack framework they have the matrix attack framework they have the matrix attack framework they have the matrix and you can just mix and match. Uh so and you can just mix and match. Uh so and you can just mix and match. Uh so when you start like understanding the when you start like understanding the when you start like understanding the labels and the when you develop this labels and the when you develop this labels and the when you develop this language you will start to see the language you will start to see the language you will start to see the patterns appear. Uh so mostly I would patterns appear. Uh so mostly I would patterns appear. Uh so mostly I would say it's trying to like AI is great in say it's trying to like AI is great in say it's trying to like AI is great in that by the way just giving you what the that by the way just giving you what the that by the way just giving you what the this vulnerability can be used for and this vulnerability can be used for and this vulnerability can be used for and just go from there like mix and just go from there like mix and just go from there like mix and match. Yeah. the chain needs at least one uh the chain needs at least one uh the chain needs at least one uh vulnerability in it that's exploitable vulnerability in it that's exploitable vulnerability in it that's exploitable in the sense of in the sense of in the sense of CVSS. So there has to be at least one CVSS. So there has to be at least one CVSS. So there has to be at least one that actually compromises it. The rest that actually compromises it. The rest that actually compromises it. The rest of them have to do with basically of them have to do with basically of them have to do with basically expanding the the damage that can be expanding the the damage that can be expanding the the damage that can be done turning a you know something small done turning a you know something small done turning a you know something small into a into a into a rce. So at least the chain must have at rce. So at least the chain must have at rce. So at least the chain must have at least least least one CVS greater than zero you know one CVS greater than zero you know one CVS greater than zero you know impact of exploitability or you know one impact of exploitability or you know one impact of exploitability or you know one of those imp impacts. So if you're going of those imp impacts. So if you're going of those imp impacts. So if you're going to look at that then you can look at how to look at that then you can look at how to look at that then you can look at how to use other issues other to use other issues other to use other issues other vulnerabilities or information uh to to vulnerabilities or information uh to to vulnerabilities or information uh to to expand the impact of the vulnerability expand the impact of the vulnerability expand the impact of the vulnerability that that you found. that that you found. that that you found. Yep. Hello. Um to expand on his question Hello. Um to expand on his question Hello. Um to expand on his question about authoritative data and mapping about authoritative data and mapping about authoritative data and mapping vulnerabilities to the MITER attack vulnerabilities to the MITER attack vulnerabilities to the MITER attack framework. So from a defensive framework. So from a defensive framework. So from a defensive perspective, we're trying to go to the perspective, we're trying to go to the perspective, we're trying to go to the left of the MITER attack framework to left of the MITER attack framework to left of the MITER attack framework to block them in the hopes they don't get block them in the hopes they don't get block them in the hopes they don't get to the right. But the challenge is where to the right. But the challenge is where to the right. But the challenge is where do we find that authorative data that do we find that authorative data that do we find that authorative data that says this privileged access says this privileged access says this privileged access vulnerability is part of that chain. vulnerability is part of that chain. vulnerability is part of that chain. Mhm. Um there's only a few spots, but Mhm. Um there's only a few spots, but Mhm. Um there's only a few spots, but when you approach this, like how did you when you approach this, like how did you when you approach this, like how did you put that chain together as you're put that chain together as you're put that chain together as you're thinking through it from an attacker's thinking through it from an attacker's thinking through it from an attacker's perspective and how could you how could perspective and how could you how could perspective and how could you how could you find a way to do that in automated, you find a way to do that in automated, you find a way to do that in automated, you know, manner so that your average you know, manner so that your average you know, manner so that your average vulnerability team, which is severely vulnerability team, which is severely vulnerability team, which is severely understaffed, can go those two threes understaffed, can go those two threes understaffed, can go those two threes are really a nine. are really a nine. are really a nine. Yeah. Um so so obviously like in NSO Yeah. Um so so obviously like in NSO Yeah. Um so so obviously like in NSO group uh we had multiple tools to to try group uh we had multiple tools to to try group uh we had multiple tools to to try to do it automatically. Uh and we also to do it automatically. Uh and we also to do it automatically. Uh and we also had lots of tools to try to find new had lots of tools to try to find new had lots of tools to try to find new vulnerabilities that weren't disclosed. vulnerabilities that weren't disclosed. vulnerabilities that weren't disclosed. Um so the main thing like for the second Um so the main thing like for the second Um so the main thing like for the second one it's it's mainly fuzzing and going one it's it's mainly fuzzing and going one it's it's mainly fuzzing and going through code. for the first one is through code. for the first one is through code. for the first one is actually going over the the the CVS actually going over the the the CVS actually going over the the the CVS themselves the the with the source code themselves the the with the source code themselves the the with the source code um or the open source packages obviously um or the open source packages obviously um or the open source packages obviously description and everything and try to uh description and everything and try to uh description and everything and try to uh you know back then I think it was you know back then I think it was you know back then I think it was machine learning it's before AI was cool machine learning it's before AI was cool machine learning it's before AI was cool but but uh but yeah it's a it's a lot of but but uh but yeah it's a it's a lot of but but uh but yeah it's a it's a lot of manual work um so you have to tag data manual work um so you have to tag data manual work um so you have to tag data manually you have to go through a lot of manually you have to go through a lot of manually you have to go through a lot of data manually um And I think now it's data manually um And I think now it's data manually um And I think now it's it's getting better like as as you can it's getting better like as as you can it's getting better like as as you can parse a lot of data and code parse a lot of data and code parse a lot of data and code automatically pretty effectively. So automatically pretty effectively. So automatically pretty effectively. So it's getting better and you can apply it's getting better and you can apply it's getting better and you can apply those tools like open like any CH GPT uh those tools like open like any CH GPT uh those tools like open like any CH GPT uh can help you classify uh vulnerabilities can help you classify uh vulnerabilities can help you classify uh vulnerabilities and if you fine-tune those models it can and if you fine-tune those models it can and if you fine-tune those models it can do do it amazingly and that's what we do do do it amazingly and that's what we do do do it amazingly and that's what we do in corner. Yeah. Uh, as you've been going through this Uh, as you've been going through this Uh, as you've been going through this research, have you found a particular research, have you found a particular research, have you found a particular class of vulnerabilities that has been class of vulnerabilities that has been class of vulnerabilities that has been especially crucial to forming chains? especially crucial to forming chains? especially crucial to forming chains? Especially what? Sorry. Especially Especially what? Sorry. Especially Especially what? Sorry. Especially crucial to forming these chains crucial to forming these chains crucial to forming these chains essentially the idea that if you essentially the idea that if you essentially the idea that if you mitigate a class of vulnerabilities, you mitigate a class of vulnerabilities, you mitigate a class of vulnerabilities, you might mitigate more chains than others. might mitigate more chains than others. might mitigate more chains than others. Um, so I guess it depends on the system. Um, so I guess it depends on the system. Um, so I guess it depends on the system. Um I can tell you that I was part of the Um I can tell you that I was part of the Um I can tell you that I was part of the iOS team. I don't think I mentioned it. iOS team. I don't think I mentioned it. iOS team. I don't think I mentioned it. And the iOS team we were built around And the iOS team we were built around And the iOS team we were built around special uh specific tactics. So each special uh specific tactics. So each special uh specific tactics. So each team was like very tactic aware and each team was like very tactic aware and each team was like very tactic aware and each team try to develop uh the the strongest team try to develop uh the the strongest team try to develop uh the the strongest solution possible. So I don't know if I solution possible. So I don't know if I solution possible. So I don't know if I can say it's a specific kind of can say it's a specific kind of can say it's a specific kind of vulnerability. Um I would say uh like in vulnerability. Um I would say uh like in vulnerability. Um I would say uh like in general when you try to exploit those general when you try to exploit those general when you try to exploit those kind those kind of system privilege kind those kind of system privilege kind those kind of system privilege escalation and being able to send data escalation and being able to send data escalation and being able to send data home it's the it's the two most home it's the it's the two most home it's the it's the two most challenging and interesting parts. So if challenging and interesting parts. So if challenging and interesting parts. So if you can resolve issues around this area you can resolve issues around this area you can resolve issues around this area um usually for phones and operating um usually for phones and operating um usually for phones and operating system obviously memory corruption and system obviously memory corruption and system obviously memory corruption and stuff that's the Uh just real quick, you mentioned AI Uh just real quick, you mentioned AI Uh just real quick, you mentioned AI being great at uh at some of this ident, being great at uh at some of this ident, being great at uh at some of this ident, you know, classifying. Um how uh have you know, classifying. Um how uh have you know, classifying. Um how uh have you explored uh agentic systems and how you explored uh agentic systems and how you explored uh agentic systems and how good they are at actually telling the good they are at actually telling the good they are at actually telling the story, building out uh building out story, building out uh building out story, building out uh building out those vulnerabilities, chaining? So the those vulnerabilities, chaining? So the those vulnerabilities, chaining? So the the the story it's very compelling and the the story it's very compelling and the the story it's very compelling and you know it's always nice to get you know it's always nice to get you know it's always nice to get positive feedback like great great positive feedback like great great positive feedback like great great story, great question from AI. Uh but story, great question from AI. Uh but story, great question from AI. Uh but yeah, storytelling I think it's great uh yeah, storytelling I think it's great uh yeah, storytelling I think it's great uh to give him the description and to give him the description and to give him the description and everything and it it really builds the everything and it it really builds the everything and it it really builds the what the attacker is going to do and what the attacker is going to do and what the attacker is going to do and paints the the awful picture uh that paints the the awful picture uh that paints the the awful picture uh that that essentially is possible. Um so it's that essentially is possible. Um so it's that essentially is possible. Um so it's really good at those things like taking really good at those things like taking really good at those things like taking the the the the the the descriptions processing it. You can try descriptions processing it. You can try descriptions processing it. You can try it with like with any description and it with like with any description and it with like with any description and and think you will be happily surprised. and think you will be happily surprised. and think you will be happily surprised. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Thank you. As a followup to that, um, have you As a followup to that, um, have you As a followup to that, um, have you found specific AI tools that are better found specific AI tools that are better found specific AI tools that are better at doing that than others? Um, so at doing that than others? Um, so at doing that than others? Um, so they're getting better every day. We they're getting better every day. We they're getting better every day. We personally we fine-tune Lama and Llama 3 personally we fine-tune Lama and Llama 3 personally we fine-tune Lama and Llama 3 on our own vulnerability database and we on our own vulnerability database and we on our own vulnerability database and we got very good results uh with this got very good results uh with this got very good results uh with this model. So yeah, thank you. Sure. Way in the back. Volunteered to run around with. Volunteered to run around with. Volunteered to run around with. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Hi. Hey. Um I guess my question is Hi. Hey. Um I guess my question is Hi. Hey. Um I guess my question is what's the difference or maybe the what's the difference or maybe the what's the difference or maybe the similarities between this and threat similarities between this and threat similarities between this and threat modeling and and uh differences. Yeah. modeling and and uh differences. Yeah. modeling and and uh differences. Yeah. For Yeah. So, so it's it's kind of a For Yeah. So, so it's it's kind of a For Yeah. So, so it's it's kind of a threat modeling. Uh you have different threat modeling. Uh you have different threat modeling. Uh you have different models um that you can apply to your models um that you can apply to your models um that you can apply to your organization and your team and it's one organization and your team and it's one organization and your team and it's one of them. Um so uh yeah, I think it's a of them. Um so uh yeah, I think it's a of them. Um so uh yeah, I think it's a great it's a great uh it's a great tool great it's a great uh it's a great tool great it's a great uh it's a great tool especially if you if you are familiar especially if you if you are familiar especially if you if you are familiar with other with other with other um attack vectors and and stuff. This is um attack vectors and and stuff. This is um attack vectors and and stuff. This is pretty digestible and with a lighter pretty digestible and with a lighter pretty digestible and with a lighter language than other threat models out language than other threat models out language than other threat models out there. So yeah, thanks. there. So yeah, thanks. there. So yeah, thanks. Okay, Okay, Okay, last one. Last one. Um I have a answer last one. Last one. Um I have a answer last one. Last one. Um I have a answer for one of the questions. So uh types of for one of the questions. So uh types of for one of the questions. So uh types of attack was serverside request forgery attack was serverside request forgery attack was serverside request forgery combined with uh engine X vulnerability, combined with uh engine X vulnerability, combined with uh engine X vulnerability, engine X controller vulnerability on the engine X controller vulnerability on the engine X controller vulnerability on the same Kubernetes cluster. that was a same Kubernetes cluster. that was a same Kubernetes cluster. that was a chain that is possible to exploit like chain that is possible to exploit like chain that is possible to exploit like um network attack vector vulnerabilities um network attack vector vulnerabilities um network attack vector vulnerabilities and server side attack request forgery. and server side attack request forgery. and server side attack request forgery. So perfect. Yeah, I think all right. Well, perfect. Yeah, I think all right. Well, perfect. Yeah, I think all right. Well, thank you Roy. Great job. Uh it was and thank you Roy. Great job. Uh it was and thank you Roy. Great job. Uh it was and uh um if you have more question or you uh um if you have more question or you uh um if you have more question or you have any feedback or anything feel free have any feedback or anything feel free have any feedback or anything feel free to connect with me on LinkedIn or to to connect with me on LinkedIn or to to connect with me on LinkedIn or to hear about codem um and yeah thank you hear about codem um and yeah thank you hear about codem um and yeah thank you very much.
