U really excited to to talk about this effort with you guys today. this effort with you guys today. this effort with you guys today. passionate as well about coordinated passionate as well about coordinated passionate as well about coordinated vulnerability disclosure. Uh been vulnerability disclosure. Uh been vulnerability disclosure. Uh been involved with the ESPOVEX community for involved with the ESPOVEX community for involved with the ESPOVEX community for a few years now, the standards a few years now, the standards a few years now, the standards community. Um glad uh to be here again community. Um glad uh to be here again community. Um glad uh to be here again at Bulcon. What a great venue. What a at Bulcon. What a great venue. What a at Bulcon.

I'll pass it back over to with you. I'll pass it back over to Tommo. Tommo. Tommo. Okay. So for today's presentation, Okay. So for today's presentation, Okay. So for today's presentation, um this is what we're going to talk um this is what we're going to talk um this is what we're going to talk about. uh CVD COP global community of about. uh CVD COP global community of about. uh CVD COP global community of practice on coordinated vulnerability practice on coordinated vulnerability practice on coordinated vulnerability disclosure which we recently established disclosure which we recently established disclosure which we recently established uh CVD overview uh about the community uh CVD overview uh about the community uh CVD overview uh about the community uh when established objectives uh why uh when established objectives uh why uh when established objectives uh why membership uh challenges things like membership uh challenges things like membership uh challenges things like that future work and we're going to ask that future work and we're going to ask that future work and we're going to ask for your feedback as for your feedback as for your feedback as well. So first uh I'm going to touch on well. So first uh I'm going to touch on well. So first uh I'm going to touch on a little bit on CBD. Um CBD um many of a little bit on CBD. Um CBD um many of a little bit on CBD. Um CBD um many of you know I guess but um I'm gonna you know I guess but um I'm gonna you know I guess but um I'm gonna explain anyway. Um coordinated explain anyway. Um coordinated explain anyway. Um coordinated vulnerability disclosure. CBD uh it is a vulnerability disclosure. CBD uh it is a vulnerability disclosure. CBD uh it is a process of gathering, coordinating and process of gathering, coordinating and process of gathering, coordinating and um disclosing of vulnerability um disclosing of vulnerability um disclosing of vulnerability information. It is a global good information. It is a global good information. It is a global good practice. often many different practice. often many different practice. often many different stakeholders are involved in the CVD stakeholders are involved in the CVD stakeholders are involved in the CVD cases and vulnerability information cases and vulnerability information cases and vulnerability information flows through uh global product supply flows through uh global product supply flows through uh global product supply chain. So it's a global thing and chain. So it's a global thing and chain. So it's a global thing and multi-party CVD MPCVD multi-party CVD MPCVD multi-party CVD MPCVD uh you may know uh multi-party uh MPCVD uh you may know uh multi-party uh MPCVD uh you may know uh multi-party uh MPCVD is a CVD case where uh many or multiple is a CVD case where uh many or multiple is a CVD case where uh many or multiple vendors and suppliers participate. is uh vendors and suppliers participate. is uh vendors and suppliers participate. is uh very complex not just because uh of the very complex not just because uh of the very complex not just because uh of the number of the participants but because number of the participants but because number of the participants but because the complexity of the MPCBD equals to the complexity of the MPCBD equals to the complexity of the MPCBD equals to the complexity of supply chain and as the complexity of supply chain and as the complexity of supply chain and as you can see with the with the situation you can see with the with the situation you can see with the with the situation um of CVD being incorporated into um of CVD being incorporated into um of CVD being incorporated into different like regulations and laws such different like regulations and laws such different like regulations and laws such as EU CRA the importance of CVD is as EU CRA the importance of CVD is as EU CRA the importance of CVD is increasing And here are here's the basic And here are here's the basic And here are here's the basic stakeholders and the information flow of stakeholders and the information flow of stakeholders and the information flow of CBD. Uh there are people like reporters, CBD. Uh there are people like reporters, CBD. Uh there are people like reporters, finders. These are people who find finders. These are people who find finders. These are people who find vulnerabilities, report vulnerabilities, report vulnerabilities, report vulnerabilities on the left. So these vulnerabilities on the left. So these vulnerabilities on the left. So these are reporters and finders. And then the are reporters and finders. And then the are reporters and finders. And then the information once found uh the information once found uh the information once found uh the vulnerability information goes to the vulnerability information goes to the vulnerability information goes to the vendor. Vendor receives the information, vendor. Vendor receives the information, vendor. Vendor receives the information, confirms the vulnerability uh creates confirms the vulnerability uh creates confirms the vulnerability uh creates patch, updates and then the information patch, updates and then the information patch, updates and then the information goes to the vulnerability advisory uh goes to the vulnerability advisory uh goes to the vulnerability advisory uh basically to the public and then the basically to the public and then the basically to the public and then the user see the vulnerability information user see the vulnerability information user see the vulnerability information and take necessary actions. That's a and take necessary actions. That's a and take necessary actions. That's a basic um stakeholders and information basic um stakeholders and information basic um stakeholders and information flow. And then there are people who are flow. And then there are people who are flow. And then there are people who are called coordinators such as myself, JPC called coordinators such as myself, JPC called coordinators such as myself, JPC or CISA. So yeah, so coordinators are or CISA. So yeah, so coordinators are or CISA. So yeah, so coordinators are kind of in a unique position in CVD. We kind of in a unique position in CVD. We kind of in a unique position in CVD. We don't uh find vulnerabilities or or we don't uh find vulnerabilities or or we don't uh find vulnerabilities or or we don't we're not product owners but don't we're not product owners but don't we're not product owners but we try to be the good CVD supporter by we try to be the good CVD supporter by we try to be the good CVD supporter by uh facilitating things uh doing the uh facilitating things uh doing the uh facilitating things uh doing the communication things like that so to communication things like that so to communication things like that so to make sure the CVD process uh goes well. make sure the CVD process uh goes well. make sure the CVD process uh goes well. So that's how we uh that's how we uh who So that's how we uh that's how we uh who So that's how we uh that's how we uh who we are. So back to you Justin. Yeah. So we are. So back to you Justin. Yeah. So we are. So back to you Justin. Yeah. So um this is revisiting the slide that um this is revisiting the slide that um this is revisiting the slide that Tommo already went over but if you Tommo already went over but if you Tommo already went over but if you cannot if it's not obvious to you what cannot if it's not obvious to you what cannot if it's not obvious to you what we're trying to emphasize here is that we're trying to emphasize here is that we're trying to emphasize here is that CBD is truly global a global process um CBD is truly global a global process um CBD is truly global a global process um in obvious ways and and Tommo again in obvious ways and and Tommo again in obvious ways and and Tommo again touched on this you have your touched on this you have your touched on this you have your multi-party CVD situation um where you multi-party CVD situation um where you multi-party CVD situation um where you have multiple vendors multiple suppliers have multiple vendors multiple suppliers have multiple vendors multiple suppliers the likelihood that those come from the likelihood that those come from the likelihood that those come from around the globe is is high you also around the globe is is high you also around the globe is is high you also have situations where maybe SISA as a have situations where maybe SISA as a have situations where maybe SISA as a coordinator we're working a CBD case coordinator we're working a CBD case coordinator we're working a CBD case with a Japanese vendor uh and it makes with a Japanese vendor uh and it makes with a Japanese vendor uh and it makes sense to to bring in JPER uh with help sense to to bring in JPER uh with help sense to to bring in JPER uh with help with the with the coordination of that with the with the coordination of that with the with the coordination of that case. uh some other things too. I mean case. uh some other things too. I mean case. uh some other things too. I mean how we're going to talk a little bit how we're going to talk a little bit how we're going to talk a little bit about how CISA very briefly uh talked about how CISA very briefly uh talked about how CISA very briefly uh talked about how CISA views CVD, how we think about how CISA views CVD, how we think about how CISA views CVD, how we think about CVD, how we conduct CVD. Tommo's about CVD, how we conduct CVD. Tommo's about CVD, how we conduct CVD. Tommo's going to give a quick overview of JPER's going to give a quick overview of JPER's going to give a quick overview of JPER's perspective and of course there's a lot perspective and of course there's a lot perspective and of course there's a lot of similarities there. But one thing of similarities there. But one thing of similarities there. But one thing that is also true in in a aspect of CVD that is also true in in a aspect of CVD that is also true in in a aspect of CVD being global is there are some nuances. being global is there are some nuances. being global is there are some nuances. Um there are some unique use cases. uh Um there are some unique use cases. uh Um there are some unique use cases. uh there are some maybe requirements that there are some maybe requirements that there are some maybe requirements that we are facing uh some different we are facing uh some different we are facing uh some different considerations being part of the federal considerations being part of the federal considerations being part of the federal government in our case uh there's government in our case uh there's government in our case uh there's aspects of the CBD process that may be aspects of the CBD process that may be aspects of the CBD process that may be unique based on the region based even unique based on the region based even unique based on the region based even based on the culture based on what level based on the culture based on what level based on the culture based on what level of involvement as a facilitator or of involvement as a facilitator or of involvement as a facilitator or coordinator that we might have because coordinator that we might have because coordinator that we might have because all of that is a little bit different all of that is a little bit different all of that is a little bit different depending on which you know in our case depending on which you know in our case depending on which you know in our case we're a national coordinator uh in Tommo we're a national coordinator uh in Tommo we're a national coordinator uh in Tommo say Tommo's case he's a uh national say Tommo's case he's a uh national say Tommo's case he's a uh national right so there's definitely different right so there's definitely different right so there's definitely different aspects of why we want to talk about CVD aspects of why we want to talk about CVD aspects of why we want to talk about CVD is global and why what we're going to is global and why what we're going to is global and why what we're going to get to we thought there was a lot of get to we thought there was a lot of get to we thought there was a lot of value in bringing a community together value in bringing a community together value in bringing a community together of coordinators in that unique role um of coordinators in that unique role um of coordinators in that unique role um to talk about how can we get better at to talk about how can we get better at to talk about how can we get better at CBD so CBD so CBD so uh if you went to uh the sisle website uh if you went to uh the sisle website uh if you went to uh the sisle website you go to the CVD page, recently updated you go to the CVD page, recently updated you go to the CVD page, recently updated I believe, right? Uh soon. Okay, it's I believe, right? Uh soon. Okay, it's I believe, right? Uh soon. Okay, it's coming soon. But if you went there, uh coming soon. But if you went there, uh coming soon. But if you went there, uh this is the definition you would see. this is the definition you would see. this is the definition you would see. This is some of the information you'd This is some of the information you'd This is some of the information you'd see about our mission and our goal. Um see about our mission and our goal. Um see about our mission and our goal. Um that that top bullet point, right? Our that that top bullet point, right? Our that that top bullet point, right? Our goal is we're coordinating the goal is we're coordinating the goal is we're coordinating the remediation and public disclosure, newly remediation and public disclosure, newly remediation and public disclosure, newly uh identified cyber security uh identified cyber security uh identified cyber security vulnerabilities and products and vulnerabilities and products and vulnerabilities and products and services with affected vendors. Uh services with affected vendors. Uh services with affected vendors. Uh that's for your traditional IT uh that's for your traditional IT uh that's for your traditional IT uh vulnerabilities. Sure. Um but probably vulnerabilities. Sure. Um but probably vulnerabilities. Sure. Um but probably in our role, our main concern and our in our role, our main concern and our in our role, our main concern and our main focus is our uh nation's critical main focus is our uh nation's critical main focus is our uh nation's critical infrastructure uh and the f federal infrastructure uh and the f federal infrastructure uh and the f federal executive branches. Um so obviously a executive branches. Um so obviously a executive branches. Um so obviously a huge focus of of ours is our uh ICS, OT, huge focus of of ours is our uh ICS, OT, huge focus of of ours is our uh ICS, OT, but we do touch on IT, OT, ICS, uh IoT, but we do touch on IT, OT, ICS, uh IoT, but we do touch on IT, OT, ICS, uh IoT, AI, all the above. Um we are also uh a AI, all the above. Um we are also uh a AI, all the above. Um we are also uh a top level route for the CVE numbering top level route for the CVE numbering top level route for the CVE numbering authority. Um, if you're not familiar authority. Um, if you're not familiar authority. Um, if you're not familiar with uh CNAs, um, you'll have with uh CNAs, um, you'll have with uh CNAs, um, you'll have opportunities to hear about that. I'm opportunities to hear about that. I'm opportunities to hear about that. I'm sure there's many CNAs here probably in sure there's many CNAs here probably in sure there's many CNAs here probably in the room. Uh, two two right here. I know the room. Uh, two two right here. I know the room. Uh, two two right here. I know looking at the crowd there there are looking at the crowd there there are looking at the crowd there there are others. Um, so learn more about the CNA others. Um, so learn more about the CNA others. Um, so learn more about the CNA program this week. Uh, but we are top program this week. Uh, but we are top program this week. Uh, but we are top level route CNA. Um, so we we help with level route CNA. Um, so we we help with level route CNA. Um, so we we help with assigning CBES uh for vendors who are assigning CBES uh for vendors who are assigning CBES uh for vendors who are also CNAs uh through IC and medical also CNAs uh through IC and medical also CNAs uh through IC and medical device uh vendors. device uh vendors. device uh vendors. Cool. Cool. Cool. And about JP sir coordination center we And about JP sir coordination center we And about JP sir coordination center we are CBD coordinator uh we coordinate are CBD coordinator uh we coordinate are CBD coordinator uh we coordinate both domestic and oversee issues. So both domestic and oversee issues. So both domestic and oversee issues. So it's not only Japanese issues that we it's not only Japanese issues that we it's not only Japanese issues that we handle. Uh we have this framework handle. Uh we have this framework handle. Uh we have this framework Japanese frame uh vulnerability handling Japanese frame uh vulnerability handling Japanese frame uh vulnerability handling framework in Japan. uh and in the framework in Japan. uh and in the framework in Japan. uh and in the framework we are designated as the framework we are designated as the framework we are designated as the coordinator of the framework and it is coordinator of the framework and it is coordinator of the framework and it is sent in accordance with the notification sent in accordance with the notification sent in accordance with the notification uh notification issued by Japanese uh notification issued by Japanese uh notification issued by Japanese government committee and Japanese government committee and Japanese government committee and Japanese vendors are registered to the framework. vendors are registered to the framework. vendors are registered to the framework. So we get to know all these vendors that So we get to know all these vendors that So we get to know all these vendors that are in Japan and then we are CNA and are in Japan and then we are CNA and are in Japan and then we are CNA and root as Justin mentioned and our root as Justin mentioned and our root as Justin mentioned and our motivation for this CVD stuff is motivation for this CVD stuff is motivation for this CVD stuff is reducing risks to the users and society. reducing risks to the users and society. reducing risks to the users and society. So, uh, this is kind of posed as as So, uh, this is kind of posed as as So, uh, this is kind of posed as as almost, yeah, to be a little bit almost, yeah, to be a little bit almost, yeah, to be a little bit playful, another working group. I know a playful, another working group. I know a playful, another working group. I know a lot of us, uh, spend a lot of our times lot of us, uh, spend a lot of our times lot of us, uh, spend a lot of our times in in working group meetings throughout in in working group meetings throughout in in working group meetings throughout our weeks and our our months. So, you our weeks and our our months. So, you our weeks and our our months. So, you might be thinking, uh, establishing might be thinking, uh, establishing might be thinking, uh, establishing another another working group. Um, and another another working group. Um, and another another working group. Um, and one thing, you know, uh, I hope you got one thing, you know, uh, I hope you got one thing, you know, uh, I hope you got to hear Pete's remarks this morning, and to hear Pete's remarks this morning, and to hear Pete's remarks this morning, and he challenged us this week. Uh, and he challenged us this week. Uh, and he challenged us this week. Uh, and what's fun about what he mentioned was what's fun about what he mentioned was what's fun about what he mentioned was it reminded me of last year at Volcon it reminded me of last year at Volcon it reminded me of last year at Volcon being here at the McKimman Center. Uh, being here at the McKimman Center. Uh, being here at the McKimman Center. Uh, and Tommo and I actually right where the and Tommo and I actually right where the and Tommo and I actually right where the registration area is uh out outside. It registration area is uh out outside. It registration area is uh out outside. It was a beautiful day. We went outside and was a beautiful day. We went outside and was a beautiful day. We went outside and enjoyed the nice weather and we had a enjoyed the nice weather and we had a enjoyed the nice weather and we had a conversation about the idea what would conversation about the idea what would conversation about the idea what would it be like to establish a group like it be like to establish a group like it be like to establish a group like this. And so probably without BonChan, I this. And so probably without BonChan, I this. And so probably without BonChan, I don't know if if we would be here don't know if if we would be here don't know if if we would be here talking to you today uh a year later talking to you today uh a year later talking to you today uh a year later about um this group that we have about um this group that we have about um this group that we have established. Um so yes, another working established. Um so yes, another working established. Um so yes, another working group. Why why is that valuable? We're group. Why why is that valuable? We're group. Why why is that valuable? We're going to talk to you about that. Tommo's going to talk to you about that. Tommo's going to talk to you about that. Tommo's going to touch on that. But uh we also going to touch on that. But uh we also going to touch on that. But uh we also recognize there has been a lot of done recognize there has been a lot of done recognize there has been a lot of done uh work done in this area. There's uh work done in this area. There's uh work done in this area. There's actually a first vulnerability actually a first vulnerability actually a first vulnerability coordination SIG that already exists. Um coordination SIG that already exists. Um coordination SIG that already exists. Um there's been previous work done all the there's been previous work done all the there's been previous work done all the way back to 2004. The NYAK uh National way back to 2004. The NYAK uh National way back to 2004. The NYAK uh National Infrastructure uh uh advisory council Infrastructure uh uh advisory council Infrastructure uh uh advisory council published a vulnerability coordination published a vulnerability coordination published a vulnerability coordination document. Uh more recent but still 10 document. Uh more recent but still 10 document. Uh more recent but still 10 years ago uh 2015 Ana put out a document years ago uh 2015 Ana put out a document years ago uh 2015 Ana put out a document about vulnerability disclosure. Next about vulnerability disclosure. Next about vulnerability disclosure. Next slide. U you have the cert guide uh two slide. U you have the cert guide uh two slide. U you have the cert guide uh two from 2017 updated the website really from 2017 updated the website really from 2017 updated the website really great uh resource for CBD in 2019. Um great uh resource for CBD in 2019. Um great uh resource for CBD in 2019. Um you had uh the center for oh I'm going you had uh the center for oh I'm going you had uh the center for oh I'm going to forget what kepts means but uh uh to forget what kepts means but uh uh to forget what kepts means but uh uh European uh think tank that put out some European uh think tank that put out some European uh think tank that put out some information about software vulnerability information about software vulnerability information about software vulnerability disclosure. Ana published a document I disclosure. Ana published a document I disclosure. Ana published a document I think in 2020 yeah 2023. We have the ISO think in 2020 yeah 2023. We have the ISO think in 2020 yeah 2023. We have the ISO standard. Um the vulnerability standard. Um the vulnerability standard. Um the vulnerability coordination SIG that I mentioned they coordination SIG that I mentioned they coordination SIG that I mentioned they put out a great resource a great put out a great resource a great put out a great resource a great document about multi-party vulnerability document about multi-party vulnerability document about multi-party vulnerability coordination back in 2020. that group is coordination back in 2020. that group is coordination back in 2020. that group is still standing but I I don't uh we had still standing but I I don't uh we had still standing but I I don't uh we had conversations with with Art uh its conversations with with Art uh its conversations with with Art uh its co-chair when we were talking about co-chair when we were talking about co-chair when we were talking about starting up this group uh because it was starting up this group uh because it was starting up this group uh because it was a consideration you can go to the next a consideration you can go to the next a consideration you can go to the next slide Tommo that we might in a sense I slide Tommo that we might in a sense I slide Tommo that we might in a sense I don't know if revitalize is the right don't know if revitalize is the right don't know if revitalize is the right word but what would it look like to join word but what would it look like to join word but what would it look like to join efforts with this group or should we efforts with this group or should we efforts with this group or should we start our own group you're going to find start our own group you're going to find start our own group you're going to find out that we decided to start our own out that we decided to start our own out that we decided to start our own group um and and we're going to explain group um and and we're going to explain group um and and we're going to explain some of those reasons why if you were some of those reasons why if you were some of those reasons why if you were here last here you maybe uh you might be here last here you maybe uh you might be here last here you maybe uh you might be thinking is this a a repeat of Tommo's thinking is this a a repeat of Tommo's thinking is this a a repeat of Tommo's presentation and in some presentation and in some presentation and in some ways not kind of right I mean the idea ways not kind of right I mean the idea ways not kind of right I mean the idea is the same some of us are ahead of of is the same some of us are ahead of of is the same some of us are ahead of of others uh and JPER was really somebody others uh and JPER was really somebody others uh and JPER was really somebody that reason we wanted to talk to Tommo that reason we wanted to talk to Tommo that reason we wanted to talk to Tommo is because of his APSert CBD working is because of his APSert CBD working is because of his APSert CBD working group we have 15 minutes by the way okay group we have 15 minutes by the way okay group we have 15 minutes by the way okay so basically just speaking about APSert so basically just speaking about APSert so basically just speaking about APSert u CVD working group is that u APSert is u CVD working group is that u APSert is u CVD working group is that u APSert is the community of different seaerts in the community of different seaerts in the community of different seaerts in Asia-Pacific region. We came together Asia-Pacific region. We came together Asia-Pacific region. We came together trying to tackle uh different CVD issues trying to tackle uh different CVD issues trying to tackle uh different CVD issues as a regional group. So we're working on as a regional group. So we're working on as a regional group. So we're working on this right now. U we have six members. this right now. U we have six members. this right now. U we have six members. We yeah we're working on it right now. We yeah we're working on it right now. We yeah we're working on it right now. And and one thing I want to highlight And and one thing I want to highlight And and one thing I want to highlight too, all these resources we just went too, all these resources we just went too, all these resources we just went through and showed you, a lot of them, through and showed you, a lot of them, through and showed you, a lot of them, if not all of them mention something if not all of them mention something if not all of them mention something that would be a value, almost an that would be a value, almost an that would be a value, almost an expectation from industry would be that expectation from industry would be that expectation from industry would be that there would be a lot of value in there would be a lot of value in there would be a lot of value in government uh international government uh international government uh international organizations coming together to organizations coming together to organizations coming together to harmonize, develop uh some common harmonize, develop uh some common harmonize, develop uh some common guidance around CBD to really emphasize guidance around CBD to really emphasize guidance around CBD to really emphasize the importance of vulnerability the importance of vulnerability the importance of vulnerability management and to develop some common management and to develop some common management and to develop some common best practices. is and so that was best practices. is and so that was best practices. is and so that was another big emphasis of why we felt another big emphasis of why we felt another big emphasis of why we felt there was a lot of value in starting there was a lot of value in starting there was a lot of value in starting this community this community this community right so uh why we established this right so uh why we established this right so uh why we established this group um CBD is a global group practice group um CBD is a global group practice group um CBD is a global group practice uh we're trying to enhance the global uh we're trying to enhance the global uh we're trying to enhance the global information corpor uh corporation and uh information corpor uh corporation and uh information corpor uh corporation and uh capacity developing uh jointly is capacity developing uh jointly is capacity developing uh jointly is important we have seen like cases where important we have seen like cases where important we have seen like cases where CVD cases fail due to uh cultural or CVD cases fail due to uh cultural or CVD cases fail due to uh cultural or language gaps between different language gaps between different language gaps between different stakeholders. So we're trying to stakeholders. So we're trying to stakeholders. So we're trying to overcome that such stuff. We're trying overcome that such stuff. We're trying overcome that such stuff. We're trying to facilitate knowledge and experience to facilitate knowledge and experience to facilitate knowledge and experience sharing um and find solutions to sharing um and find solutions to sharing um and find solutions to overcome the the challenges while we're overcome the the challenges while we're overcome the the challenges while we're carrying out carrying out carrying out CBD. So these uh I'm not going to walk CBD. So these uh I'm not going to walk CBD. So these uh I'm not going to walk through these in depth. These are through these in depth. These are through these in depth. These are actually so we do have an established actually so we do have an established actually so we do have an established charter for our community of practice. charter for our community of practice. charter for our community of practice. Um these kind of spell out what our Um these kind of spell out what our Um these kind of spell out what our ultimate our goals and objectives. Tommo ultimate our goals and objectives. Tommo ultimate our goals and objectives. Tommo kind of highlighted what that was kind of highlighted what that was kind of highlighted what that was already just on the last slide. Um, but already just on the last slide. Um, but already just on the last slide. Um, but really we want to uh bring together uh really we want to uh bring together uh really we want to uh bring together uh CVD uh subject matter experts um in the CVD uh subject matter experts um in the CVD uh subject matter experts um in the role of third party coordinator whether role of third party coordinator whether role of third party coordinator whether that be national coordinators or uh that be national coordinators or uh that be national coordinators or uh nationals. Um we we you'll see in a nationals. Um we we you'll see in a nationals. Um we we you'll see in a later slide we we kind of characterize later slide we we kind of characterize later slide we we kind of characterize our membership as you're either a our membership as you're either a our membership as you're either a government entity or an ent entity that government entity or an ent entity that government entity or an ent entity that works with the government in official works with the government in official works with the government in official capac official capacity to conduct uh uh capac official capacity to conduct uh uh capac official capacity to conduct uh uh CBD for the government. And so uh one CBD for the government. And so uh one CBD for the government. And so uh one thing next slide's good hopefully you thing next slide's good hopefully you thing next slide's good hopefully you had a chance to read those. Um you know had a chance to read those. Um you know had a chance to read those. Um you know the ultimate goal is we wanted to come the ultimate goal is we wanted to come the ultimate goal is we wanted to come better come together to get better at better come together to get better at better come together to get better at CBD. I mean that's that's as simple as CBD. I mean that's that's as simple as CBD. I mean that's that's as simple as it is and especially I think being in it is and especially I think being in it is and especially I think being in the role that we're in as a third party the role that we're in as a third party the role that we're in as a third party coordinator. We have a unique role as coordinator. We have a unique role as coordinator. We have a unique role as Tommo pointed out because we of course Tommo pointed out because we of course Tommo pointed out because we of course are facilitating uh we're bridge are facilitating uh we're bridge are facilitating uh we're bridge builders I think is a really good way of builders I think is a really good way of builders I think is a really good way of describing what we do. We're bridge describing what we do. We're bridge describing what we do. We're bridge builders. We're a neutral third party, a builders. We're a neutral third party, a builders. We're a neutral third party, a neutral facilitator. Sometimes we're a neutral facilitator. Sometimes we're a neutral facilitator. Sometimes we're a deescalator if it gets contentious deescalator if it gets contentious deescalator if it gets contentious hopefully and and I would say more often hopefully and and I would say more often hopefully and and I would say more often than not that's not the case. Um but we than not that's not the case. Um but we than not that's not the case. Um but we do serve a unique role and we have you do serve a unique role and we have you do serve a unique role and we have you know almost a a piece in terms of that know almost a a piece in terms of that know almost a a piece in terms of that bridge building in each uh part of the bridge building in each uh part of the bridge building in each uh part of the stakeholders that are involved in the stakeholders that are involved in the stakeholders that are involved in the CVD process. And so one thing I also CVD process. And so one thing I also CVD process. And so one thing I also want to mention before we kind of wrap want to mention before we kind of wrap want to mention before we kind of wrap up the presentation this group we're not up the presentation this group we're not up the presentation this group we're not coming together to form any official coming together to form any official coming together to form any official policy that you know thou shalt do these policy that you know thou shalt do these policy that you know thou shalt do these things. We're not coming together uh to things. We're not coming together uh to things. We're not coming together uh to we're not a a a regulating body. We're we're not a a a regulating body. We're we're not a a a regulating body. We're not a standards group. We're we are not a standards group. We're we are not a standards group. We're we are really coming together to uh bring really coming together to uh bring really coming together to uh bring like-minded individuals or organizations like-minded individuals or organizations like-minded individuals or organizations in the area of CBD who are thirdparty in the area of CBD who are thirdparty in the area of CBD who are thirdparty coordinators um to come together to to coordinators um to come together to to coordinators um to come together to to harmonize and develop common guidance harmonize and develop common guidance harmonize and develop common guidance around CBD to ultimately help uh the around CBD to ultimately help uh the around CBD to ultimately help uh the greater CBD community be better. And and greater CBD community be better. And and greater CBD community be better. And and I think we're in a a unique and good I think we're in a a unique and good I think we're in a a unique and good role to be in position to help do that. role to be in position to help do that. role to be in position to help do that. So, uh, current state, we established So, uh, current state, we established So, uh, current state, we established this group, um, in December, right at this group, um, in December, right at this group, um, in December, right at the end of last year. Uh, we had our the end of last year. Uh, we had our the end of last year. Uh, we had our first official meeting December 5th. We first official meeting December 5th. We first official meeting December 5th. We have been meeting monthly ever since. have been meeting monthly ever since. have been meeting monthly ever since. So, uh, we've had about four or five So, uh, we've had about four or five So, uh, we've had about four or five months of meetings. Um, we're we're months of meetings. Um, we're we're months of meetings. Um, we're we're structured very similar to your standard structured very similar to your standard structured very similar to your standard working group. We have uh, co- we have a working group. We have uh, co- we have a working group. We have uh, co- we have a few different co-chairs, myself, Tommo, few different co-chairs, myself, Tommo, few different co-chairs, myself, Tommo, and our friend Ali from the UK. Um, we and our friend Ali from the UK. Um, we and our friend Ali from the UK. Um, we have 17 different participants. You're have 17 different participants. You're have 17 different participants. You're going to actually see those in the next going to actually see those in the next going to actually see those in the next slide. Um, we have 70 different slide. Um, we have 70 different slide. Um, we have 70 different participants uh throughout the globe participants uh throughout the globe participants uh throughout the globe representing uh 14 different countries representing uh 14 different countries representing uh 14 different countries or because we have an Nissa in there, we or because we have an Nissa in there, we or because we have an Nissa in there, we say 14 different countries, 15 different say 14 different countries, 15 different say 14 different countries, 15 different regions. Um, we have we've finalized a regions. Um, we have we've finalized a regions. Um, we have we've finalized a community charter. Um, our membership is community charter. Um, our membership is community charter. Um, our membership is I want to say it's diverse obvious. I want to say it's diverse obvious. I want to say it's diverse obvious. Obviously, it's diverse in the sense Obviously, it's diverse in the sense Obviously, it's diverse in the sense that we come from different countries, that we come from different countries, that we come from different countries, different cultures, different different cultures, different different cultures, different backgrounds, different even as roles of backgrounds, different even as roles of backgrounds, different even as roles of coordinators, we have different coordinators, we have different coordinators, we have different involvement in the process of CBD. Um, involvement in the process of CBD. Um, involvement in the process of CBD. Um, but one thing that's been really but one thing that's been really but one thing that's been really exciting is, uh, our memberships are, I exciting is, uh, our memberships are, I exciting is, uh, our memberships are, I would say, at like different stages in would say, at like different stages in would say, at like different stages in their CBD journey. Some of us, you know, their CBD journey. Some of us, you know, their CBD journey. Some of us, you know, you might say, are a little bit further you might say, are a little bit further you might say, are a little bit further along. Some of us are new or just kind along. Some of us are new or just kind along. Some of us are new or just kind of starting out. What's exciting about of starting out. What's exciting about of starting out. What's exciting about that for us is while that can kind of that for us is while that can kind of that for us is while that can kind of present some challenges, it's really an present some challenges, it's really an present some challenges, it's really an opportunity. I think for us who are opportunity. I think for us who are opportunity. I think for us who are further down the road, maybe have a further down the road, maybe have a further down the road, maybe have a little bit more experience or little bit more experience or little bit more experience or understanding, it's good to remember and understanding, it's good to remember and understanding, it's good to remember and remind ourselves what it was like when remind ourselves what it was like when remind ourselves what it was like when we were first starting out. I think we were first starting out. I think we were first starting out. I think there's a lot of value in that because there's a lot of value in that because there's a lot of value in that because sometimes you can develop uh or overlook sometimes you can develop uh or overlook sometimes you can develop uh or overlook some things or develop some bad habits some things or develop some bad habits some things or develop some bad habits or practices. Um so it's good to uh to or practices. Um so it's good to uh to or practices. Um so it's good to uh to look at those uh uh processes closely look at those uh uh processes closely look at those uh uh processes closely and those for those who are newer in the and those for those who are newer in the and those for those who are newer in the journey you know they can look to us um journey you know they can look to us um journey you know they can look to us um and apply how we are doing things to how and apply how we are doing things to how and apply how we are doing things to how as they are developing their process as they are developing their process as they are developing their process processes and practices they can look to processes and practices they can look to processes and practices they can look to us to kind of uh help guide their own uh us to kind of uh help guide their own uh us to kind of uh help guide their own uh maybe not do it exactly the same but at maybe not do it exactly the same but at maybe not do it exactly the same but at least take inspiration least take inspiration least take inspiration from so yeah here's the the membership from so yeah here's the the membership from so yeah here's the the membership um that I had mentioned uh we're really um that I had mentioned uh we're really um that I had mentioned uh we're really excited uh that not only do we have excited uh that not only do we have excited uh that not only do we have great participation so far um we have great participation so far um we have great participation so far um we have other uh organizations who are other uh organizations who are other uh organizations who are interested um if you are yourself a interested um if you are yourself a interested um if you are yourself a national coordinator um who is not national coordinator um who is not national coordinator um who is not involved in this group please come talk involved in this group please come talk involved in this group please come talk to us uh whether you want to join or to us uh whether you want to join or to us uh whether you want to join or just have have an opinion have some just have have an opinion have some just have have an opinion have some questions um questions about CBD how you questions um questions about CBD how you questions um questions about CBD how you could get involved if you're a vendor uh could get involved if you're a vendor uh could get involved if you're a vendor uh supplier um uh if you work in in private supplier um uh if you work in in private supplier um uh if you work in in private sector industry and you're involved with sector industry and you're involved with sector industry and you're involved with with CVD, please come talk to us. Please with CVD, please come talk to us. Please with CVD, please come talk to us. Please come find us. We'd love to hear from come find us. We'd love to hear from come find us. We'd love to hear from you. Um we're we're going to talk about you. Um we're we're going to talk about you. Um we're we're going to talk about that actually and pose some questions to that actually and pose some questions to that actually and pose some questions to you here as we wrap up the presentation. you here as we wrap up the presentation. you here as we wrap up the presentation. Yeah. So the challenges spotted so far Yeah. So the challenges spotted so far Yeah. So the challenges spotted so far um in this community uh the first thing um in this community uh the first thing um in this community uh the first thing is that different CV uh we all have is that different CV uh we all have is that different CV uh we all have different like CVD image for of different like CVD image for of different like CVD image for of different like members. So for one different like members. So for one different like members. So for one member when respect uh when we are member when respect uh when we are member when respect uh when we are talking about CVD we're talking about talking about CVD we're talking about talking about CVD we're talking about like the coordination part mostly but like the coordination part mostly but like the coordination part mostly but for other coord uh other organization for other coord uh other organization for other coord uh other organization they more focus on information they more focus on information they more focus on information distribution after the disclosure part. distribution after the disclosure part. distribution after the disclosure part. So we're saying you know CVD CVD we are So we're saying you know CVD CVD we are So we're saying you know CVD CVD we are thinking that we're you know talking thinking that we're you know talking thinking that we're you know talking about same thing but we're actually about same thing but we're actually about same thing but we're actually talking about like it happens that we're talking about like it happens that we're talking about like it happens that we're talking about different things so we talking about different things so we talking about different things so we should be careful about that. And the should be careful about that. And the should be careful about that. And the second one is on a different level of second one is on a different level of second one is on a different level of understanding. I mean this happens and understanding. I mean this happens and understanding. I mean this happens and it's not that you know one is it's not that you know one is it's not that you know one is understanding more than other you know understanding more than other you know understanding more than other you know differences are beautiful so this is a differences are beautiful so this is a differences are beautiful so this is a good thing I guess but um yeah different good thing I guess but um yeah different good thing I guess but um yeah different level of understanding occurs uh exist level of understanding occurs uh exist level of understanding occurs uh exist so that's another thing to watch out for so that's another thing to watch out for so that's another thing to watch out for and in the group uh more vocal and less and in the group uh more vocal and less and in the group uh more vocal and less vocal organizations exist we're trying vocal organizations exist we're trying vocal organizations exist we're trying um I guess this is a comfort issue maybe um I guess this is a comfort issue maybe um I guess this is a comfort issue maybe so we're trying to overcome that and so we're trying to overcome that and so we're trying to overcome that and then the last one um the members are then the last one um the members are then the last one um the members are mainly government related organizations. mainly government related organizations. mainly government related organizations. So it needs a balanced uh it needs to be So it needs a balanced uh it needs to be So it needs a balanced uh it needs to be balanced with different stakeholders in balanced with different stakeholders in balanced with different stakeholders in the ecosystem as a whole. So the these the ecosystem as a whole. So the these the ecosystem as a whole. So the these are the challenges that we have spotted are the challenges that we have spotted are the challenges that we have spotted so so so far. So summary um you want to far. So summary um you want to far. So summary um you want to okay global good practice we mentioned okay global good practice we mentioned okay global good practice we mentioned that um international cooperation is that um international cooperation is that um international cooperation is important and fun. uh harmonization is important and fun. uh harmonization is important and fun. uh harmonization is what we are focusing on and then what what we are focusing on and then what what we are focusing on and then what we're trying to do actually here in CBDC we're trying to do actually here in CBDC we're trying to do actually here in CBDC I would like to emphasize is that global I would like to emphasize is that global I would like to emphasize is that global CVD uh coordinators coming together and CVD uh coordinators coming together and CVD uh coordinators coming together and trying to get better that's it you know trying to get better that's it you know trying to get better that's it you know we're trying to enhance the we're trying to enhance the we're trying to enhance the effectiveness of vulnerability effectiveness of vulnerability effectiveness of vulnerability coordination globally and uh it's not coordination globally and uh it's not coordination globally and uh it's not about like CVD processes uh basically about like CVD processes uh basically about like CVD processes uh basically you know it's not going to work if I you know it's not going to work if I you know it's not going to work if I mean even if we follow the same mean even if we follow the same mean even if we follow the same processes uh it's not going to work processes uh it's not going to work processes uh it's not going to work because you know coordination part is because you know coordination part is because you know coordination part is very important if things aren't being very important if things aren't being very important if things aren't being coordinated it's going to end up in coordinated it's going to end up in coordinated it's going to end up in uh not achieving the goal of CVD which uh not achieving the goal of CVD which uh not achieving the goal of CVD which is risk reduction so um what I would is risk reduction so um what I would is risk reduction so um what I would like to emphasize here is that you know like to emphasize here is that you know like to emphasize here is that you know it's not just about the processes uh the it's not just about the processes uh the it's not just about the processes uh the coordination part is very coordination part is very coordination part is very important great and we we're going to important great and we we're going to important great and we we're going to pose some questions to you on the next pose some questions to you on the next pose some questions to you on the next slide uh what you know we have some slide uh what you know we have some slide uh what you know we have some ideas of what we want to do now that ideas of what we want to do now that ideas of what we want to do now that we're established and and getting a we're established and and getting a we're established and and getting a little more organized we we're we're little more organized we we're we're little more organized we we're we're even going to be using GitHub hub as a even going to be using GitHub hub as a even going to be using GitHub hub as a as a sharing uh mechanism. Uh right now as a sharing uh mechanism. Uh right now as a sharing uh mechanism. Uh right now that's a private repository but um uh that's a private repository but um uh that's a private repository but um uh that's something that's exciting too that's something that's exciting too that's something that's exciting too that we can have that asynchronous that we can have that asynchronous that we can have that asynchronous communication and and work on things communication and and work on things communication and and work on things asynchronously and not just for the one asynchronously and not just for the one asynchronously and not just for the one hour we meet monthly. Um but we'd love hour we meet monthly. Um but we'd love hour we meet monthly. Um but we'd love to pose the question for you. We have to pose the question for you. We have to pose the question for you. We have some ideas of what we would think would some ideas of what we would think would some ideas of what we would think would be good starting uh a good starting be good starting uh a good starting be good starting uh a good starting deliverable perhaps to deliver to the deliverable perhaps to deliver to the deliverable perhaps to deliver to the community, but you guys are the experts. community, but you guys are the experts. community, but you guys are the experts. Uh and like Tommo just pointed out, we Uh and like Tommo just pointed out, we Uh and like Tommo just pointed out, we need some balance. We're a bunch of need some balance.

Love to hear from you like what would Love to hear from you like what would Love to hear from you like what would you like to see from our community of you like to see from our community of you like to see from our community of practice? What what do you think are practice? What what do you think are practice? What what do you think are some of the gaps that exist? what is some of the gaps that exist? what is some of the gaps that exist? what is needed for CBD to help it uh be better needed for CBD to help it uh be better needed for CBD to help it uh be better in general and and how do you think in in general and and how do you think in in general and and how do you think in our unique role uh could we provide that our unique role uh could we provide that our unique role uh could we provide that service? How might you envision uh our service? How might you envision uh our service?

So there's our Is this on? Okay, here we there's our Is this on? Okay, here we there's our Is this on? Okay, here we go. There's a uh there's already a go. There's a uh there's already a go. There's a uh there's already a vulnerability coordination SIG within vulnerability coordination SIG within vulnerability coordination SIG within first. Are you guys coordinating with first. Are you guys coordinating with first. Are you guys coordinating with them for the different audiences? them for the different audiences? them for the different audiences? So Art uh correct me if I'm wrong. Uh So Art uh correct me if I'm wrong. Uh So Art uh correct me if I'm wrong. Uh that group um while still technically an that group um while still technically an that group um while still technically an official SIG and I think you you will official SIG and I think you you will official SIG and I think you you will meet in Copenhagen probably, right? At meet in Copenhagen probably, right? At meet in Copenhagen probably, right? At least a chat. um it's not necessarily least a chat. um it's not necessarily least a chat. um it's not necessarily having active having active having active uh meetings and and developing anything uh meetings and and developing anything uh meetings and and developing anything in the meantime. We did talk to Art um in the meantime. We did talk to Art um in the meantime. We did talk to Art um early on and and it was even thrown out early on and and it was even thrown out early on and and it was even thrown out like well maybe we just uh not take over like well maybe we just uh not take over like well maybe we just uh not take over but maybe maybe we come in and and but maybe maybe we come in and and but maybe maybe we come in and and revitalize that group or re re repurpose revitalize that group or re re repurpose revitalize that group or re re repurpose that group. Um we ultimately decided to that group. Um we ultimately decided to that group. Um we ultimately decided to start our own but yeah um we are start our own but yeah um we are start our own but yeah um we are definitely taking you know all those definitely taking you know all those definitely taking you know all those resources that we showed you earlier you resources that we showed you earlier you resources that we showed you earlier you know we're not trying to reinvent the know we're not trying to reinvent the know we're not trying to reinvent the wheel. um we're going to take you know wheel. um we're going to take you know wheel. um we're going to take you know we consider those if anything like we consider those if anything like we consider those if anything like foundational those anything that we foundational those anything that we foundational those anything that we develop is going to be guided and develop is going to be guided and develop is going to be guided and referenced by those things including the referenced by those things including the referenced by those things including the work that the vulnerability coordination work that the vulnerability coordination work that the vulnerability coordination SIG has done. So yes Pete so I'm not SIG has done. So yes Pete so I'm not SIG has done. So yes Pete so I'm not rrestle you for it but u since I was rrestle you for it but u since I was rrestle you for it but u since I was involved in a lot of those other efforts involved in a lot of those other efforts involved in a lot of those other efforts and when we did the 2020 redo and we did and when we did the 2020 redo and we did and when we did the 2020 redo and we did uh MPD Mhm. I think there's a whole lot uh MPD Mhm. I think there's a whole lot uh MPD Mhm. I think there's a whole lot missing. You got to go back to the 20 missing. You got to go back to the 20 missing. You got to go back to the 20 the 2004 document which is all bilateral the 2004 document which is all bilateral the 2004 document which is all bilateral uh and was mostly through CCC or uh and was mostly through CCC or uh and was mostly through CCC or direct there's a lot more coordination direct there's a lot more coordination direct there's a lot more coordination that goes on right now that goes on right now that goes on right now within the producer communities and I within the producer communities and I within the producer communities and I think we need to account for that and think we need to account for that and think we need to account for that and then the question is the roles that the then the question is the roles that the then the question is the roles that the CNAs and more specifically the roots and CNAs and more specifically the roots and CNAs and more specifically the roots and root the CNRs have in here what does root the CNRs have in here what does root the CNRs have in here what does that play and when I look at what they that play and when I look at what they that play and when I look at what they did in MVVE was actually a discussion a did in MVVE was actually a discussion a did in MVVE was actually a discussion a bunch of us had already about disclosure bunch of us had already about disclosure bunch of us had already about disclosure as not as not as not being a good term being a good term being a good term because there's many things that happen because there's many things that happen because there's many things that happen in there without going to a coordinator. in there without going to a coordinator. in there without going to a coordinator. Um and we need to if we're going to do Um and we need to if we're going to do Um and we need to if we're going to do the effort I think we need to really the effort I think we need to really the effort I think we need to really think through that effort and uh I know think through that effort and uh I know think through that effort and uh I know from the PER side we need to be part of from the PER side we need to be part of from the PER side we need to be part of that effort because we're the guys most that effort because we're the guys most that effort because we're the guys most often doing the work. Sure. Uh so I often doing the work. Sure. Uh so I often doing the work. Sure. Uh so I don't know what that lash up will be but don't know what that lash up will be but don't know what that lash up will be but we need to kind of talk our way through we need to kind of talk our way through we need to kind of talk our way through that.
