I don't claim that it is groups can use. I don't claim that it is groups can use. I don't claim that it is thorough and complete. there may be thorough and complete. there may be thorough and complete. there may be things that need to be added. So, I things that need to be added. So, I things that need to be added. So, I encourage the Q&amp;A and as I told Mike at encourage the Q&amp;A and as I told Mike at encourage the Q&amp;A and as I told Mike at this at the start, I believe that this at the start, I believe that this at the start, I believe that lecturing has been obsolete since the lecturing has been obsolete since the lecturing has been obsolete since the invention of movable type. You guys can invention of movable type. You guys can invention of movable type. You guys can download the slides later and look download the slides later and look download the slides later and look through them. I'm going to go through through them. I'm going to go through through them. I'm going to go through them fairly quickly. The reason to have them fairly quickly. The reason to have them fairly quickly. The reason to have the presentation is to give you the the presentation is to give you the the presentation is to give you the opportunity to ask questions and discuss opportunity to ask questions and discuss opportunity to ask questions and discuss the topic.

Um so Um so Um so um goal of this talk did that actually um goal of this talk did that actually um goal of this talk did that actually work? Yes. Uh quickly this is about me work? Yes. Uh quickly this is about me work? Yes. Uh quickly this is about me um and about the trusted computing uh um and about the trusted computing uh um and about the trusted computing uh trusted computing group circumstance. trusted computing group circumstance. trusted computing group circumstance. This really doesn't have much range on This really doesn't have much range on This really doesn't have much range on it, does it? Okay, I'll try not to be it, does it? Okay, I'll try not to be it, does it? Okay, I'll try not to be too close to it. Um I've been around a too close to it. Um I've been around a too close to it. Um I've been around a long time. I uh I worked on the original long time. I uh I worked on the original long time. I uh I worked on the original Mars worm. Uh I developed the first Mars worm. Uh I developed the first Mars worm. Uh I developed the first classes for eenics. This was before SANS classes for eenics. This was before SANS classes for eenics. This was before SANS existed. So, uh, it's been a while. I existed. So, uh, it's been a while. I existed. So, uh, it's been a while. I was the first full-time PERT member at was the first full-time PERT member at was the first full-time PERT member at Cisco and I've been involved with first Cisco and I've been involved with first Cisco and I've been involved with first since since since 1990. Um, that was the previous century. 1990. Um, that was the previous century. 1990. Um, that was the previous century. Maybe I do need to worry about looking Maybe I do need to worry about looking Maybe I do need to worry about looking natural, Brian. Um, when I was employed natural, Brian. Um, when I was employed natural, Brian. Um, when I was employed at Juniper Networks and doing SDL work, at Juniper Networks and doing SDL work, at Juniper Networks and doing SDL work, I was the alternate uh for Juniper's I was the alternate uh for Juniper's I was the alternate uh for Juniper's board seat at the trusted computing board seat at the trusted computing board seat at the trusted computing group and that's where this came about. group and that's where this came about. group and that's where this came about. I um this group is should be well known I um this group is should be well known I um this group is should be well known uh it's a worldwide group very active uh it's a worldwide group very active uh it's a worldwide group very active membership they fundamentally develop membership they fundamentally develop membership they fundamentally develop work protocols support integrated work protocols support integrated work protocols support integrated circuits and so forth around that circuits and so forth around that circuits and so forth around that support trusted computing uh the TPM support trusted computing uh the TPM support trusted computing uh the TPM standard for example I'm willing to bet standard for example I'm willing to bet standard for example I'm willing to bet you that every single phone and laptop you that every single phone and laptop you that every single phone and laptop in this room have a TPM chip probably in this room have a TPM chip probably in this room have a TPM chip probably made by made by made by Infinine so this stuff directly affects Infinine so this stuff directly affects Infinine so this stuff directly affects you Um, but what matters here is not so you Um, but what matters here is not so you Um, but what matters here is not so much about the TPM itself, but choosing much about the TPM itself, but choosing much about the TPM itself, but choosing to look at the trusted computing group to look at the trusted computing group to look at the trusted computing group as a standards group and stuff that was as a standards group and stuff that was as a standards group and stuff that was going on there. Um, and I'll remind you going on there. Um, and I'll remind you going on there. Um, and I'll remind you that last line down here, note well that last line down here, note well that last line down here, note well these are competitors working together these are competitors working together these are competitors working together on a common goal. Okay, remember that on a common goal. Okay, remember that on a common goal. Okay, remember that because that competitive circumstance because that competitive circumstance because that competitive circumstance uh constrains a lot of what happens uh constrains a lot of what happens uh constrains a lot of what happens here. Any questions? I'm really burning here. Any questions? I'm really burning here. Any questions? I'm really burning through this quickly. Sorry. So, through this quickly. Sorry. So, through this quickly. Sorry. So, everybody has everybody has everybody has vulnerabilities. Um, and u I personally vulnerabilities. Um, and u I personally vulnerabilities. Um, and u I personally witnessed hallway conversations where witnessed hallway conversations where witnessed hallway conversations where people were talking about flaws and they people were talking about flaws and they people were talking about flaws and they were positing whether the other guy had were positing whether the other guy had were positing whether the other guy had the flaw or not and do we tell them the flaw or not and do we tell them the flaw or not and do we tell them about it or not and oh god my alarm about it or not and oh god my alarm about it or not and oh god my alarm bells are going off in my head. We got bells are going off in my head. We got bells are going off in my head. We got very worried about how stuff might be very worried about how stuff might be very worried about how stuff might be mishandled, how you have uneven mishandled, how you have uneven mishandled, how you have uneven disclosure. disclosure. disclosure. it every sort of bad circumstance came it every sort of bad circumstance came it every sort of bad circumstance came to the four. Um my employer gave me to the four. Um my employer gave me to the four. Um my employer gave me support for this and we had some other support for this and we had some other support for this and we had some other like-minded board members and so we like-minded board members and so we like-minded board members and so we launched into the creation of a launched into the creation of a launched into the creation of a vulnerability response subcommittee. We vulnerability response subcommittee. We vulnerability response subcommittee. We met for 10 months. We solicited met for 10 months. We solicited met for 10 months. We solicited feedback. I was really happy we got over feedback. I was really happy we got over feedback. I was really happy we got over 150 comments and these weren't like 150 comments and these weren't like 150 comments and these weren't like looks good Jim. These were substantive looks good Jim. These were substantive looks good Jim. These were substantive comments with real content that you know comments with real content that you know comments with real content that you know was actionable. Um using that we was actionable. Um using that we was actionable. Um using that we composed what we called a vulnerability composed what we called a vulnerability composed what we called a vulnerability response framework and the word response framework and the word response framework and the word framework is important because you don't framework is important because you don't framework is important because you don't want it to be too rigid or too want it to be too rigid or too want it to be too rigid or too constrained. So framework implies more constrained. So framework implies more constrained. So framework implies more of a guidelines approach and within that of a guidelines approach and within that of a guidelines approach and within that framework we recommended a vulnerability framework we recommended a vulnerability framework we recommended a vulnerability response team to be set up. It's response team to be set up. It's response team to be set up. It's insulated separate from the board by the insulated separate from the board by the insulated separate from the board by the vulnerabil vulnerability response vulnerabil vulnerability response vulnerabil vulnerability response subcommittee um that provides a buffer subcommittee um that provides a buffer subcommittee um that provides a buffer uh between the two and we did that on uh between the two and we did that on uh between the two and we did that on purpose. The members of the VRT are purpose. The members of the VRT are purpose. The members of the VRT are nominated by the board. Um they are nominated by the board. Um they are nominated by the board. Um they are typically employees of member companies. typically employees of member companies. typically employees of member companies. Um and then they're approved by VRS. Um and then they're approved by VRS. Um and then they're approved by VRS. after they are approved and put on the after they are approved and put on the after they are approved and put on the VRT, their membership and participation VRT, their membership and participation VRT, their membership and participation in the VRP outlasts any change in board in the VRP outlasts any change in board in the VRP outlasts any change in board membership. However, if the employer membership. However, if the employer membership. However, if the employer leaves TCG, then that VRT members leaves TCG, then that VRT members leaves TCG, then that VRT members participation does end because there's participation does end because there's participation does end because there's no longer the uh the U membership no longer the uh the U membership no longer the uh the U membership relationship. So key things to note that came up in So key things to note that came up in So key things to note that came up in the review and are important for the the review and are important for the the review and are important for the rest of this talk. Um we're talking rest of this talk. Um we're talking rest of this talk. Um we're talking about in most cases resolving a report about in most cases resolving a report about in most cases resolving a report versus resolving a vulnerability. That's versus resolving a vulnerability. That's versus resolving a vulnerability. That's a very important distinction. We a very important distinction. We a very important distinction. We anticipated and we were correct that anticipated and we were correct that anticipated and we were correct that most of the stuff that comes in would most of the stuff that comes in would most of the stuff that comes in would involve a report of an issue that we involve a report of an issue that we involve a report of an issue that we could not directly address. We had to could not directly address. We had to could not directly address. We had to hand it off to someone else to fix it. hand it off to someone else to fix it. hand it off to someone else to fix it. There are circumstances where we would There are circumstances where we would There are circumstances where we would have vulnerability but those were in the have vulnerability but those were in the have vulnerability but those were in the minority. Um another point uh another minority. Um another point uh another minority. Um another point uh another important point was that the oversight important point was that the oversight important point was that the oversight committee was separate from the response committee was separate from the response committee was separate from the response team. Um the VRS is managerial not team. Um the VRS is managerial not team. Um the VRS is managerial not hands-on and the VRT does the heavy hands-on and the VRT does the heavy hands-on and the VRT does the heavy lifting. lifting. lifting. there was a misalignment of there was a misalignment of there was a misalignment of confidentiality expectations and in confidentiality expectations and in confidentiality expectations and in short I'll tell you that the people who short I'll tell you that the people who short I'll tell you that the people who work on standards group understand work on standards group understand work on standards group understand confidentiality but not in the way that confidentiality but not in the way that confidentiality but not in the way that a vulnerability response team a vulnerability response team a vulnerability response team understands it u the pert expectation is understands it u the pert expectation is understands it u the pert expectation is different and last but not least different and last but not least different and last but not least intellectual property is existential for intellectual property is existential for intellectual property is existential for a standards group that really becomes a standards group that really becomes a standards group that really becomes the buck stops here sort of circumstance the buck stops here sort of circumstance the buck stops here sort of circumstance when you're dealing with uh when you're dealing with uh when you're dealing with uh vulnerability reporting and resolution So, we did have a major unforeseen So, we did have a major unforeseen So, we did have a major unforeseen obstacle and I hinted hinted at this in obstacle and I hinted hinted at this in obstacle and I hinted hinted at this in the write up for the for the program. the write up for the for the program. the write up for the for the program. Um, there were some numbers some number Um, there were some numbers some number Um, there were some numbers some number of members including board members who of members including board members who of members including board members who were alarmed. Um, they thought that they were alarmed. Um, they thought that they were alarmed. Um, they thought that they were going to be relinquishing control were going to be relinquishing control were going to be relinquishing control over sensitive intellectual property. over sensitive intellectual property. over sensitive intellectual property. Um, and we did anticipate that some Um, and we did anticipate that some Um, and we did anticipate that some people would do that, but we did not uh people would do that, but we did not uh people would do that, but we did not uh anticipate how intense and heated the anticipate how intense and heated the anticipate how intense and heated the concern would be. Um, suffice it to say, concern would be. Um, suffice it to say, concern would be. Um, suffice it to say, we had board members who found we had board members who found we had board members who found themselves in between between TCG and themselves in between between TCG and themselves in between between TCG and their own employer and fireworks that their own employer and fireworks that their own employer and fireworks that would erupt if there was a perception would erupt if there was a perception would erupt if there was a perception that they had given up control of some that they had given up control of some that they had given up control of some sensitive IP. Um, so we managed to uh it sensitive IP. Um, so we managed to uh it sensitive IP. Um, so we managed to uh it was a charm offensive. we managed to was a charm offensive. we managed to was a charm offensive. we managed to allay their concerns and um move move allay their concerns and um move move allay their concerns and um move move beyond beyond beyond that. Any questions so far? So roles and far? So roles and far? So roles and responsibilities fundamentally the responsibilities fundamentally the responsibilities fundamentally the members of the VRT are PERT people from members of the VRT are PERT people from members of the VRT are PERT people from their own employer. Um we don't want their own employer. Um we don't want their own employer. Um we don't want subject manager subject matter experts subject manager subject matter experts subject manager subject matter experts to be handling cases. They may be to be handling cases. They may be to be handling cases. They may be involved, but fundamentally the people involved, but fundamentally the people involved, but fundamentally the people that are on the VRT need to be experts that are on the VRT need to be experts that are on the VRT need to be experts at incident response and specifically e at incident response and specifically e at incident response and specifically e experts at product security incident experts at product security incident experts at product security incident response. On the flip side, the folks on response. On the flip side, the folks on response. On the flip side, the folks on the VRT are not going to have the the VRT are not going to have the the VRT are not going to have the technical knowledge and especially with technical knowledge and especially with technical knowledge and especially with TCG, you get into some pretty wild stuff TCG, you get into some pretty wild stuff TCG, you get into some pretty wild stuff with the crypto and and u other with the crypto and and u other with the crypto and and u other similarly deep topics. So, we knew we similarly deep topics. So, we knew we similarly deep topics. So, we knew we were going to need to interact were going to need to interact were going to need to interact withmemes. The problem is is that in the withmemes. The problem is is that in the withmemes. The problem is is that in the general case, if you go ask a subject general case, if you go ask a subject general case, if you go ask a subject matter expert from a working group to matter expert from a working group to matter expert from a working group to help you out and you don't frame any help you out and you don't frame any help you out and you don't frame any constraints around the email that you constraints around the email that you constraints around the email that you send them and you say, "Hey, can you send them and you say, "Hey, can you send them and you say, "Hey, can you help me out with this issue?" There's a help me out with this issue?" There's a help me out with this issue?" There's a chance that they'll write back and say, chance that they'll write back and say, chance that they'll write back and say, "No, I can't, but Frank over here can "No, I can't, but Frank over here can "No, I can't, but Frank over here can help you." And he's already carboncopied help you." And he's already carboncopied help you." And he's already carboncopied Frank on it. And it turns out that Frank Frank on it. And it turns out that Frank Frank on it. And it turns out that Frank was the least likely person you wanted was the least likely person you wanted was the least likely person you wanted involved in an incident. He was a involved in an incident. He was a involved in an incident. He was a disaster on a previous one. So these disaster on a previous one. So these disaster on a previous one. So these interactions withmemes begin with a interactions withmemes begin with a interactions withmemes begin with a careful dance. You reach out to the SMA. careful dance. You reach out to the SMA. careful dance. You reach out to the SMA. I got a topic that I need to work on I got a topic that I need to work on I got a topic that I need to work on with you. I mean, this is the VRT, so with you. I mean, this is the VRT, so with you. I mean, this is the VRT, so they're already excited. I got a topic I they're already excited. I got a topic I they're already excited. I got a topic I need to work with you on. I need to make need to work with you on. I need to make need to work with you on. I need to make sure that you understand these sure that you understand these sure that you understand these constraints on information sharing. If constraints on information sharing. If constraints on information sharing. If you can't help with this, reply to me you can't help with this, reply to me you can't help with this, reply to me only and don't share it with anyone only and don't share it with anyone only and don't share it with anyone else. If they are willing to help, then else. If they are willing to help, then else. If they are willing to help, then good. You're off and running. If they good. You're off and running. If they good. You're off and running. If they say no, I can't, then uh we go to the say no, I can't, then uh we go to the say no, I can't, then uh we go to the next person in the list. So, is that next person in the list. So, is that next person in the list. So, is that clear? That part's really important. If clear? That part's really important. If clear? That part's really important. If you don't take away anything else and you don't take away anything else and you don't take away anything else and you're new to product security, incident you're new to product security, incident you're new to product security, incident response, take that away because that'll response, take that away because that'll response, take that away because that'll help you on an incident later. I help you on an incident later. I help you on an incident later. I guarantee you. So, team staffing and oversight, we you. So, team staffing and oversight, we you. So, team staffing and oversight, we decided the ideal number of incident decided the ideal number of incident decided the ideal number of incident responders on the VRT would be between responders on the VRT would be between responders on the VRT would be between four and six people. Uh, currently I'm four and six people. Uh, currently I'm four and six people. Uh, currently I'm told because I'm not directly on the told because I'm not directly on the told because I'm not directly on the team anymore. Currently I'm told there's team anymore. Currently I'm told there's team anymore. Currently I'm told there's five people on the uh on the VRT. As I five people on the uh on the VRT. As I five people on the uh on the VRT. As I mentioned earlier, they're nominated by mentioned earlier, they're nominated by mentioned earlier, they're nominated by board member and approved by the VRS. board member and approved by the VRS. board member and approved by the VRS. Um, and the membership outlasts uh any Um, and the membership outlasts uh any Um, and the membership outlasts uh any board involvement. Um, the VRT members, board involvement. Um, the VRT members, board involvement. Um, the VRT members, the VRT itself operates like any other the VRT itself operates like any other the VRT itself operates like any other work group. So there's administrative work group. So there's administrative work group. So there's administrative stuff that goes on. The members of the stuff that goes on. The members of the stuff that goes on. The members of the VRT choose from themselves who will be VRT choose from themselves who will be VRT choose from themselves who will be chair and co-chair. Um, and they have chair and co-chair. Um, and they have chair and co-chair. Um, and they have support from admin and so forth I'll support from admin and so forth I'll support from admin and so forth I'll mention in a moment. Uh, when an mention in a moment. Uh, when an mention in a moment. Uh, when an incident comes up, there's actually a incident comes up, there's actually a incident comes up, there's actually a plain text file that has the names of plain text file that has the names of plain text file that has the names of the VRT members listed in in an order. the VRT members listed in in an order. the VRT members listed in in an order. And as each new incident comes up, TCG And as each new incident comes up, TCG And as each new incident comes up, TCG admin opens up that file and it takes admin opens up that file and it takes admin opens up that file and it takes the next name off the list and crosses the next name off the list and crosses the next name off the list and crosses over the one above it and assigns the over the one above it and assigns the over the one above it and assigns the issue to that person. If they can't issue to that person. If they can't issue to that person. If they can't handle that issue, then it goes to the handle that issue, then it goes to the handle that issue, then it goes to the next one. It's real simple allocation. next one. It's real simple allocation. next one. It's real simple allocation. allocation scheme round robin. Maybe it allocation scheme round robin. Maybe it allocation scheme round robin. Maybe it was an allocation scheme. I don't was an allocation scheme. I don't was an allocation scheme. I don't know. So, there are several issue types know. So, there are several issue types know. So, there are several issue types worth noting. Um, the most obvious and worth noting. Um, the most obvious and worth noting. Um, the most obvious and most frequent one is a vendor product most frequent one is a vendor product most frequent one is a vendor product flaw. In other words, a member's system flaw. In other words, a member's system flaw. In other words, a member's system has a vulnerability in it. Um, you would has a vulnerability in it. Um, you would has a vulnerability in it. Um, you would notify the affected member. But really notify the affected member. But really notify the affected member. But really important here, you need to figure out important here, you need to figure out important here, you need to figure out if there are other members who are if there are other members who are if there are other members who are affected because it would be terrible to affected because it would be terrible to affected because it would be terrible to publish and proceed with one member publish and proceed with one member publish and proceed with one member getting a fix and the other ones are are getting a fix and the other ones are are getting a fix and the other ones are are still caught out in the cold. Um, that still caught out in the cold. Um, that still caught out in the cold. Um, that would not be would not be would not be good. Um, and this is the part where I good. Um, and this is the part where I good. Um, and this is the part where I talk about resolving a report. That's talk about resolving a report. That's talk about resolving a report. That's the bulk of the stuff that they get is the bulk of the stuff that they get is the bulk of the stuff that they get is resolving a report just like that. Um, resolving a report just like that. Um, resolving a report just like that. Um, there's a possibility that the report there's a possibility that the report there's a possibility that the report involves um, one of the specifications involves um, one of the specifications involves um, one of the specifications or a reference document. Um, so this is or a reference document. Um, so this is or a reference document. Um, so this is the actual documentation that says how the actual documentation that says how the actual documentation that says how it's all supposed to work. It's it's all supposed to work. It's it's all supposed to work. It's happened. There have been defects, happened. There have been defects, happened. There have been defects, typos, and other stuff in some of the typos, and other stuff in some of the typos, and other stuff in some of the specifications that would lead to a specifications that would lead to a specifications that would lead to a vulnerable condition. When you're vulnerable condition. When you're vulnerable condition. When you're dealing with that, that's something that dealing with that, that's something that dealing with that, that's something that TCG does own outright and the PERT team TCG does own outright and the PERT team TCG does own outright and the PERT team would handle that as a normal product would handle that as a normal product would handle that as a normal product security incident. So that's no security incident. So that's no security incident. So that's no different than regular product security different than regular product security different than regular product security incident incident incident work. Third category is TCG reference work. Third category is TCG reference work. Third category is TCG reference code. And I'll tell you, nobody is code. And I'll tell you, nobody is code. And I'll tell you, nobody is supposed to run reference code, but you supposed to run reference code, but you supposed to run reference code, but you know, stuff happens and u they do run it know, stuff happens and u they do run it know, stuff happens and u they do run it and it's sort of looped carefully with and it's sort of looped carefully with and it's sort of looped carefully with that previous one since the reference that previous one since the reference that previous one since the reference code is based on the reference document. code is based on the reference document. code is based on the reference document. Um, but same issue. If that happens, you Um, but same issue. If that happens, you Um, but same issue. If that happens, you would proceed as a typical PERT case, would proceed as a typical PERT case, would proceed as a typical PERT case, but that one's pretty rare. I think it's but that one's pretty rare. I think it's but that one's pretty rare. I think it's happened at least once. Where's happened at least once. Where's happened at least once. Where's Blake? I don't see him. He might know. Blake? I don't see him. He might know. Blake? I don't see him. He might know. um non-TCG issues. We would get messages um non-TCG issues. We would get messages um non-TCG issues. We would get messages asking people about implementation asking people about implementation asking people about implementation questions or specification questions. questions or specification questions. questions or specification questions. Sometimes that would hinge on a Sometimes that would hinge on a Sometimes that would hinge on a potential vulnerable issue, but not an potential vulnerable issue, but not an potential vulnerable issue, but not an actual vulnerability. Uh if we could actual vulnerability. Uh if we could actual vulnerability. Uh if we could figure out where to send that, we would figure out where to send that, we would figure out where to send that, we would notify the workg group chair for the notify the workg group chair for the notify the workg group chair for the appropriate work group and let them you appropriate work group and let them you appropriate work group and let them you just hand it off and let them take care just hand it off and let them take care just hand it off and let them take care of it. There's the resolving the report. of it. There's the resolving the report. of it. There's the resolving the report. Um and of course, there were also nonTCG Um and of course, there were also nonTCG Um and of course, there were also nonTCG vulnerabilities. is if you put a website vulnerabilities. is if you put a website vulnerabilities. is if you put a website up there about security and you have an up there about security and you have an up there about security and you have an email address, sooner or later people email address, sooner or later people email address, sooner or later people are going to send you stuff that you are going to send you stuff that you are going to send you stuff that you don't have any control over u and don't have any control over u and don't have any control over u and they'll be looking for an answer. So if they'll be looking for an answer. So if they'll be looking for an answer. So if you can figure out who to send it to, we you can figure out who to send it to, we you can figure out who to send it to, we do that. But otherwise, let it do that. But otherwise, let it do that. But otherwise, let it go. Multi-party coordination becomes go. Multi-party coordination becomes go. Multi-party coordination becomes important. Um it's possible that an important. Um it's possible that an important. Um it's possible that an issue will be larger than the TCG and issue will be larger than the TCG and issue will be larger than the TCG and larger than you can handle. Uh it may be larger than you can handle. Uh it may be larger than you can handle. Uh it may be an industry-wide issue. Um in that an industry-wide issue. Um in that an industry-wide issue. Um in that circumstance it makes sense to escalate circumstance it makes sense to escalate circumstance it makes sense to escalate it to one of the large uh coordinating it to one of the large uh coordinating it to one of the large uh coordinating parties. Uh this could be Vince but we parties. Uh this could be Vince but we parties. Uh this could be Vince but we intentionally wrote the policy intentionally wrote the policy intentionally wrote the policy generically so that we could go to you generically so that we could go to you generically so that we could go to you know Tommo with JPER for example or know Tommo with JPER for example or know Tommo with JPER for example or there's multiple teams now where there there's multiple teams now where there there's multiple teams now where there used to be one uh there folks in Europe used to be one uh there folks in Europe used to be one uh there folks in Europe and Asia as well as North America who and Asia as well as North America who and Asia as well as North America who can handle a multi-party issue. can handle a multi-party issue. can handle a multi-party issue. um as um as um as um conversely we might be in the um conversely we might be in the um conversely we might be in the circumstance where a multi-party issue circumstance where a multi-party issue circumstance where a multi-party issue is known outside and it might affect TCG is known outside and it might affect TCG is known outside and it might affect TCG and the contact would happen. There's no and the contact would happen. There's no and the contact would happen. There's no surprises there. Um an incident manager surprises there. Um an incident manager surprises there. Um an incident manager would be selected and and and take it would be selected and and and take it would be selected and and and take it on. The one case, the one circumstance on. The one case, the one circumstance on. The one case, the one circumstance that really worries me is where you have that really worries me is where you have that really worries me is where you have a really big incident and a outside a really big incident and a outside a really big incident and a outside coordinator is working with individual coordinator is working with individual coordinator is working with individual TCG members, all of whom have actually TCG members, all of whom have actually TCG members, all of whom have actually also reported it internally and now also reported it internally and now also reported it internally and now you've got the internal vulnerability you've got the internal vulnerability you've got the internal vulnerability response team working on it. And you may response team working on it. And you may response team working on it. And you may have a misalignment about who's been have a misalignment about who's been have a misalignment about who's been told what and how much they've been told what and how much they've been told what and how much they've been shared. um that is going to be a shared. um that is going to be a shared. um that is going to be a potential nightmare and calls for a lot potential nightmare and calls for a lot potential nightmare and calls for a lot of flexibility, grace and common sense of flexibility, grace and common sense of flexibility, grace and common sense as I mentioned there. So administrative support, the there. So administrative support, the there. So administrative support, the VRT is essentially a work group just VRT is essentially a work group just VRT is essentially a work group just like any other with a couple of like any other with a couple of like any other with a couple of constraints. Um one of those constraints constraints. Um one of those constraints constraints. Um one of those constraints is you can't get in unless you're is you can't get in unless you're is you can't get in unless you're nominated to be a member of the VRT. nominated to be a member of the VRT. nominated to be a member of the VRT. That sort of runs contrary to the way That sort of runs contrary to the way That sort of runs contrary to the way most standards groups operate. If your most standards groups operate. If your most standards groups operate. If your employer is a member, any any of your employer is a member, any any of your employer is a member, any any of your co-workers can join and they can co-workers can join and they can co-workers can join and they can typically join any work group they want. typically join any work group they want. typically join any work group they want. That doesn't happen here. Um TCG admin That doesn't happen here. Um TCG admin That doesn't happen here. Um TCG admin provides the administrative support just provides the administrative support just provides the administrative support just like they do to the rest of the group. like they do to the rest of the group. like they do to the rest of the group. In this case, instead of all of TCG In this case, instead of all of TCG In this case, instead of all of TCG admin could be 10 or 12 people possibly, admin could be 10 or 12 people possibly, admin could be 10 or 12 people possibly, there's one person who's assigned to there's one person who's assigned to there's one person who's assigned to work with the VRT. And again, it's just work with the VRT. And again, it's just work with the VRT. And again, it's just like their usual work except that they like their usual work except that they like their usual work except that they also need to know about incident also need to know about incident also need to know about incident response tooling and um and uh the response tooling and um and uh the response tooling and um and uh the things that they need to do to manage things that they need to do to manage things that they need to do to manage that. They manage the signal group for that. They manage the signal group for that. They manage the signal group for example. They manage the uh availability example. They manage the uh availability example. They manage the uh availability of the PGP key and so forth. Um in terms of tooling for the forth. Um in terms of tooling for the forth. Um in terms of tooling for the team itself, it's no different than a team itself, it's no different than a team itself, it's no different than a regular incident response team. You got regular incident response team. You got regular incident response team. You got a SL security page that tells people how a SL security page that tells people how a SL security page that tells people how to engage with the group. There's to engage with the group. There's to engage with the group. There's channels for reporting issues. Um, TCG channels for reporting issues. Um, TCG channels for reporting issues. Um, TCG admin is watching all of that and admin is watching all of that and admin is watching all of that and activates the VRT as needed. Um, team activates the VRT as needed. Um, team activates the VRT as needed. Um, team members know how to use PGP. They know members know how to use PGP. They know members know how to use PGP. They know how to score stuff with CVSS and label how to score stuff with CVSS and label how to score stuff with CVSS and label stuff with TLP and they know how to use stuff with TLP and they know how to use stuff with TLP and they know how to use signal group. Um, worth note there's no signal group. Um, worth note there's no signal group. Um, worth note there's no need for TCG's operation to become a need for TCG's operation to become a need for TCG's operation to become a CNA. Uh, issues are far, you know, few CNA. Uh, issues are far, you know, few CNA. Uh, issues are far, you know, few and far between and it would be it would and far between and it would be it would and far between and it would be it would be silly to go to that work. virtually be silly to go to that work. virtually be silly to go to that work. virtually every member of the VRT, their own every member of the VRT, their own every member of the VRT, their own employer is already a CNA. Um, and if employer is already a CNA. Um, and if employer is already a CNA. Um, and if you needed a CV, you could just go to you needed a CV, you could just go to you needed a CV, you could just go to one of them. Um, Blake tells me that in one of them. Um, Blake tells me that in one of them. Um, Blake tells me that in reality, nobody's doing that because reality, nobody's doing that because reality, nobody's doing that because they don't want to own a TCG issue. So, they don't want to own a TCG issue. So, they don't want to own a TCG issue. So, they're just going straight to um u they're just going straight to um u they're just going straight to um u straight to the CVE program to get a label. Um, communications approvals and label. Um, communications approvals and label. Um, communications approvals and legal consultations, important areas legal consultations, important areas legal consultations, important areas that we had to address. Um, one is in that we had to address. Um, one is in that we had to address. Um, one is in terms of terms of terms of publishing, it's a standards or publishing, it's a standards or publishing, it's a standards or intellectual property is king. The intellectual property is king. The intellectual property is king. The general rule is nothing is published general rule is nothing is published general rule is nothing is published that isn't signed off by the board. And that isn't signed off by the board. And that isn't signed off by the board. And this happens after all the other sub this happens after all the other sub this happens after all the other sub approvals have occurred from the approvals have occurred from the approvals have occurred from the technical committee, the work group and technical committee, the work group and technical committee, the work group and all the rest of that. That doesn't work all the rest of that. That doesn't work all the rest of that. That doesn't work when you have minutes or hours and you when you have minutes or hours and you when you have minutes or hours and you need to publish a security advisory need to publish a security advisory need to publish a security advisory quickly. Uh so we arranged for uh any quickly. Uh so we arranged for uh any quickly. Uh so we arranged for uh any two officers instead of the full board two officers instead of the full board two officers instead of the full board of directors would be able to approve uh of directors would be able to approve uh of directors would be able to approve uh approve something that needed to be approve something that needed to be approve something that needed to be published or needed to be communicated published or needed to be communicated published or needed to be communicated externally uh because this also could externally uh because this also could externally uh because this also could apply to email to some outside group um apply to email to some outside group um apply to email to some outside group um or some other circumstance. or some other circumstance. or some other circumstance. Um, we also realized that there would be Um, we also realized that there would be Um, we also realized that there would be an outsized dependence on legal counsel an outsized dependence on legal counsel an outsized dependence on legal counsel consultation. Um, and again for the consultation. Um, and again for the consultation. Um, and again for the general case that's expensive. I think general case that's expensive. I think general case that's expensive. I think it's $200 an hour. Um, and uh that it's $200 an hour. Um, and uh that it's $200 an hour. Um, and uh that required board approval. We were able to required board approval. We were able to required board approval. We were able to arrange the board to u pre-allocate some arrange the board to u pre-allocate some arrange the board to u pre-allocate some number of hours for VRT use in an number of hours for VRT use in an number of hours for VRT use in an emergency. I think it was $800 worth so emergency. I think it was $800 worth so emergency. I think it was $800 worth so four hours or something like that. Um four hours or something like that. Um four hours or something like that. Um and that's been used that has been used and that's been used that has been used and that's been used that has been used at times but that enables more rapid at times but that enables more rapid at times but that enables more rapid response by the team eliminates a response by the team eliminates a response by the team eliminates a hurdle. So what did we miss? Um we hurdle. So what did we miss? Um we hurdle. So what did we miss? Um we needed to review the existing crisis needed to review the existing crisis needed to review the existing crisis management plan for alignment and management plan for alignment and management plan for alignment and technically that's still an open task technically that's still an open task technically that's still an open task and I think I'm responsible for that and I think I'm responsible for that and I think I'm responsible for that even though I have not been on the team even though I have not been on the team even though I have not been on the team for over two years. Uh I'm an invited for over two years. Uh I'm an invited for over two years. Uh I'm an invited expert with the team and so I will be um expert with the team and so I will be um expert with the team and so I will be um trying to re-up this stuff after uh in trying to re-up this stuff after uh in trying to re-up this stuff after uh in the next couple of weeks. Um I think the next couple of weeks. Um I think the next couple of weeks. Um I think it's important to review membership it's important to review membership it's important to review membership requirements for for possible problems. requirements for for possible problems. requirements for for possible problems. Um that's something that I wish we had Um that's something that I wish we had Um that's something that I wish we had done early in the process. We've done a done early in the process. We've done a done early in the process. We've done a little bit of it, but technically it's little bit of it, but technically it's little bit of it, but technically it's still an open task. Um, you want to make still an open task. Um, you want to make still an open task. Um, you want to make sure that you don't have problems, for sure that you don't have problems, for sure that you don't have problems, for example, sharing information uh or example, sharing information uh or example, sharing information uh or obligations that uh information be obligations that uh information be obligations that uh information be shared with third parties that you shared with third parties that you shared with third parties that you weren't aware of. Um, and you'll find weren't aware of. Um, and you'll find weren't aware of. Um, and you'll find that by looking at the membership stuff. that by looking at the membership stuff. that by looking at the membership stuff. It's also important to understand TCG, It's also important to understand TCG, It's also important to understand TCG, for example, has multiple levels of for example, has multiple levels of for example, has multiple levels of membership and that uh with varying membership and that uh with varying membership and that uh with varying amounts of access and control over the amounts of access and control over the amounts of access and control over the organization. Um, and so you need to be organization. Um, and so you need to be organization. Um, and so you need to be aware of those different levels. aware of those different levels. aware of those different levels. Um, last but not least, I think it's Um, last but not least, I think it's Um, last but not least, I think it's important to research the history of the important to research the history of the important to research the history of the organization for earlier flaws. U, you organization for earlier flaws. U, you organization for earlier flaws. U, you may find stuff. I was laughing with uh may find stuff. I was laughing with uh may find stuff. I was laughing with uh Brian earlier. I was the first PERT guy Brian earlier. I was the first PERT guy Brian earlier. I was the first PERT guy on the uh for Cisco and um I remember on the uh for Cisco and um I remember on the uh for Cisco and um I remember finding some stuff from the early 1980s finding some stuff from the early 1980s finding some stuff from the early 1980s in Cisco IOS that will probably never be in Cisco IOS that will probably never be in Cisco IOS that will probably never be fixed. But it's important to look for fixed. But it's important to look for fixed. But it's important to look for that stuff because you might find that stuff because you might find that stuff because you might find something that's actionable and needs to something that's actionable and needs to something that's actionable and needs to be addressed. Uh so don't assume that be addressed. Uh so don't assume that be addressed. Uh so don't assume that it's just from this date forward. Look it's just from this date forward. Look it's just from this date forward. Look at the older at the older at the older stuff. So the VRT was officially stood stuff. So the VRT was officially stood stuff. So the VRT was officially stood up um late summer in up um late summer in up um late summer in 2019. Uh we estimated there would be two 2019. Uh we estimated there would be two 2019. Uh we estimated there would be two to three incidents per year. As of 2025, to three incidents per year. As of 2025, to three incidents per year. As of 2025, I'm told that there's an average of one I'm told that there's an average of one I'm told that there's an average of one to three annually. So pretty low rate. to three annually. So pretty low rate. to three annually. So pretty low rate. Um, but the really cool part is every Um, but the really cool part is every Um, but the really cool part is every time I interact with TCG people, even time I interact with TCG people, even time I interact with TCG people, even though I've been away from it for a though I've been away from it for a though I've been away from it for a while, is they compliment me on doing while, is they compliment me on doing while, is they compliment me on doing the VRT. So, um, that's been pretty the VRT. So, um, that's been pretty the VRT. So, um, that's been pretty cool. Uh, no negative comments since the cool. Uh, no negative comments since the cool. Uh, no negative comments since the team was stood up, just praise for the team was stood up, just praise for the team was stood up, just praise for the team, which team, which team, which is I think it's the best way to do it. is I think it's the best way to do it. is I think it's the best way to do it. Um, and so key takeaways in no Um, and so key takeaways in no Um, and so key takeaways in no particular order, standards of groups particular order, standards of groups particular order, standards of groups need a vulnerability process. It's about need a vulnerability process. It's about need a vulnerability process. It's about resolving a report versus a resolving a report versus a resolving a report versus a vulnerability. Um, engage withmemes vulnerability. Um, engage withmemes vulnerability. Um, engage withmemes one-on-one with great constraint. That's one-on-one with great constraint. That's one-on-one with great constraint. That's a really important one. Um, you'll need a really important one. Um, you'll need a really important one. Um, you'll need multi-party coordination internally. multi-party coordination internally. multi-party coordination internally. Intellectual property is Intellectual property is Intellectual property is existential. Um, negotiate express existential. Um, negotiate express existential. Um, negotiate express processes for publishing and decision-m. processes for publishing and decision-m. processes for publishing and decision-m. review membership requirements and keep review membership requirements and keep review membership requirements and keep separate the oversight group from the separate the oversight group from the separate the oversight group from the operations group and protect the operations group and protect the operations group and protect the membership of the response team. And membership of the response team. And membership of the response team. And that's what I have for you.
