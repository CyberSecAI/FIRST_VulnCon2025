So, and there's two friends, you know. So, and there's two friends, you know. So, thank thank you for coming. thank thank you for coming. thank thank you for coming. Um Justin uh he unfortunately had a Um Justin uh he unfortunately had a Um Justin uh he unfortunately had a family emergency so he's not going to be family emergency so he's not going to be family emergency so he's not going to be able to attend here today. But what I able to attend here today. But what I able to attend here today. But what I would like to do is uh give you somewhat would like to do is uh give you somewhat would like to do is uh give you somewhat of an update on what is new in the of an update on what is new in the of an update on what is new in the common security advisory framework common security advisory framework common security advisory framework standard and what is actually happening standard and what is actually happening standard and what is actually happening and what is the state of the union for and what is the state of the union for and what is the state of the union for open EOX rogue which was presenting open EOX rogue which was presenting open EOX rogue which was presenting right before me. He was actually going right before me. He was actually going right before me. He was actually going over the use cases in Red Hat of uh open over the use cases in Red Hat of uh open over the use cases in Red Hat of uh open EOX. So, I'm gonna, you know, take a EOX. So, I'm gonna, you know, take a EOX. So, I'm gonna, you know, take a step back and actually introduce, you step back and actually introduce, you step back and actually introduce, you know, what we're trying to do and and know, what we're trying to do and and know, what we're trying to do and and and so on. and so on. and so on. The The The See, I have two systems to go through. See, I have two systems to go through. See, I have two systems to go through. There we go. So, again, my name is Omar There we go. So, again, my name is Omar There we go. So, again, my name is Omar Santos. I'm from Cisco. Whole bunch of, Santos. I'm from Cisco. Whole bunch of, Santos. I'm from Cisco. Whole bunch of, you know, boring stuff that I do. One of you know, boring stuff that I do. One of you know, boring stuff that I do. One of them is around vulnerability disclosure them is around vulnerability disclosure them is around vulnerability disclosure for quite some time. A lot of the folks for quite some time. A lot of the folks for quite some time. A lot of the folks from the PERT organization in PERT at from the PERT organization in PERT at from the PERT organization in PERT at Cisco are right there in that table. Um, Cisco are right there in that table. Um, Cisco are right there in that table. Um, but I'm part of a sec organization but I'm part of a sec organization but I'm part of a sec organization called security and trust. So PERT, called security and trust. So PERT, called security and trust. So PERT, CERT, the offensive security team, now CERT, the offensive security team, now CERT, the offensive security team, now AI security research, uh, market access, AI security research, uh, market access, AI security research, uh, market access, um, you know, you name it. We're,00 um, you know, you name it. We're,00 um, you know, you name it. We're,00 people. We look into how to secure Cisco people. We look into how to secure Cisco people. We look into how to secure Cisco and also how to secure the products that and also how to secure the products that and also how to secure the products that we actually make and help protect we actually make and help protect we actually make and help protect customers. So I oversee now customers. So I oversee now customers. So I oversee now responsibilities from a technical uh responsibilities from a technical uh responsibilities from a technical uh perspective. Uh in there outside of perspective. Uh in there outside of perspective. Uh in there outside of Cisco I am part of an organization Cisco I am part of an organization Cisco I am part of an organization called Oasis open which is a standards called Oasis open which is a standards called Oasis open which is a standards organization that CISAF and open EOX organization that CISAF and open EOX organization that CISAF and open EOX belong to. How many of you have heard of belong to. How many of you have heard of belong to. How many of you have heard of Oasis before? Actually let me take this Oasis before? Actually let me take this Oasis before? Actually let me take this back. How many of you have not heard of back. How many of you have not heard of back. How many of you have not heard of Oasis before? Okay. So the super fast if Oasis before? Okay. So the super fast if Oasis before? Okay. So the super fast if you have an Amble alert in your phone you have an Amble alert in your phone you have an Amble alert in your phone that's always a standard. They've been that's always a standard. They've been that's always a standard. They've been in assistant for more than 25 years. So in assistant for more than 25 years. So in assistant for more than 25 years. So now they're really really popular now they're really really popular now they're really really popular because of cyber security and now even because of cyber security and now even because of cyber security and now even with AI. So I'm part of the board in with AI. So I'm part of the board in with AI. So I'm part of the board in there. uh I co-lead a few efforts there. uh I co-lead a few efforts there. uh I co-lead a few efforts related to standards specifically uh related to standards specifically uh related to standards specifically uh CISAF and uh and open EOX and I'm also CISAF and uh and open EOX and I'm also CISAF and uh and open EOX and I'm also honored to be the co-chair for the honored to be the co-chair for the honored to be the co-chair for the coalition for secure AI with Anthropic coalition for secure AI with Anthropic coalition for secure AI with Anthropic OpenAI Nvidia whole bunch of different OpenAI Nvidia whole bunch of different OpenAI Nvidia whole bunch of different companies actually trying to figure out companies actually trying to figure out companies actually trying to figure out how to guide the rest of the industry on how to guide the rest of the industry on how to guide the rest of the industry on how to protect our ecosystem now with how to protect our ecosystem now with how to protect our ecosystem now with these emerging technologies. these emerging technologies. these emerging technologies. Justin um I'm going to introduce him Justin um I'm going to introduce him Justin um I'm going to introduce him even if he's not here. He actually was even if he's not here. He actually was even if he's not here. He actually was here yesterday presenting. You might here yesterday presenting. You might here yesterday presenting. You might already have interacted with him. He's already have interacted with him. He's already have interacted with him. He's from from from CISA. Amazing contributor to the CISA. Amazing contributor to the CISA. Amazing contributor to the community both in CESAF and Open EX EOX community both in CESAF and Open EX EOX community both in CESAF and Open EX EOX but also in the in the ESBOM ecosystem but also in the in the ESBOM ecosystem but also in the in the ESBOM ecosystem and of course with the vulnerability and of course with the vulnerability and of course with the vulnerability explor exchange. I'm gonna put one more explor exchange. I'm gonna put one more explor exchange. I'm gonna put one more person under the I'm gonna throw him person under the I'm gonna throw him person under the I'm gonna throw him under the bus, but he's Thomas Schaefer. under the bus, but he's Thomas Schaefer. under the bus, but he's Thomas Schaefer. He's from BSI in Germany. If it wasn't He's from BSI in Germany. If it wasn't He's from BSI in Germany. If it wasn't for this guy, probably even CISAF would for this guy, probably even CISAF would for this guy, probably even CISAF would not exist right now. So, amazing not exist right now. So, amazing not exist right now. So, amazing contributions that they're doing, not contributions that they're doing, not contributions that they're doing, not only on the standards and the technical only on the standards and the technical only on the standards and the technical work, but a lot of open source tools work, but a lot of open source tools work, but a lot of open source tools that they actually have created. I'm that they actually have created. I'm that they actually have created. I'm talking about a plethora of them. So, talking about a plethora of them. So, talking about a plethora of them. So, thank you, Thomas. And actually, he's thank you, Thomas. And actually, he's thank you, Thomas. And actually, he's going to keep me honest here today. going to keep me honest here today. going to keep me honest here today. Um as I mentioned to you of course these Um as I mentioned to you of course these Um as I mentioned to you of course these two standard efforts are under Oasis. two standard efforts are under Oasis. two standard efforts are under Oasis. However However However um this is the so currently we stand at um this is the so currently we stand at um this is the so currently we stand at the second version of the standard the second version of the standard the second version of the standard before CISF it was called the common before CISF it was called the common before CISF it was called the common vulnerability reporting framework and it vulnerability reporting framework and it vulnerability reporting framework and it was under um a nonprofit organization was under um a nonprofit organization was under um a nonprofit organization that got merged with first called that got merged with first called that got merged with first called Iicassi. As a matter of fact, Bruce in Iicassi. As a matter of fact, Bruce in Iicassi. As a matter of fact, Bruce in the back was one of the original the back was one of the original the back was one of the original contributors to the standard and uh we contributors to the standard and uh we contributors to the standard and uh we had a need into how can we modernize had a need into how can we modernize had a need into how can we modernize back in the day and Bruce correct me if back in the day and Bruce correct me if back in the day and Bruce correct me if I'm wrong. I think this was back in 2012 I'm wrong. I think this was back in 2012 I'm wrong. I think this was back in 2012 that we started around that era CVRF. Um that we started around that era CVRF. Um that we started around that era CVRF. Um we called that modernize and everybody we called that modernize and everybody we called that modernize and everybody actually now calls modernize, right? actually now calls modernize, right? actually now calls modernize, right? uh but we wanted to say hey instead of uh but we wanted to say hey instead of uh but we wanted to say hey instead of humans actually exchanging vulnerability humans actually exchanging vulnerability humans actually exchanging vulnerability information how can we actually have information how can we actually have information how can we actually have machines and machine speed do this you machines and machine speed do this you machines and machine speed do this you fast forward many years we're still fast forward many years we're still fast forward many years we're still trying to struggle how machines can trying to struggle how machines can trying to struggle how machines can exchange vulnerability information in exchange vulnerability information in exchange vulnerability information in the whole ecosystem even in the age of the whole ecosystem even in the age of the whole ecosystem even in the age of AI right so um what we did is within AI right so um what we did is within AI right so um what we did is within ITASI we had uh these initiatives but we ITASI we had uh these initiatives but we ITASI we had uh these initiatives but we were not a standards organization so we were not a standards organization so we were not a standards organization so we decided is of course because of IPR I'm decided is of course because of IPR I'm decided is of course because of IPR I'm not going to bore you to death we not going to bore you to death we not going to bore you to death we decided to change the name and actually decided to change the name and actually decided to change the name and actually uh bring it up to Oasis and that's what uh bring it up to Oasis and that's what uh bring it up to Oasis and that's what actually took off BSI started actually took off BSI started actually took off BSI started contributing many many organizations contributing many many organizations contributing many many organizations across the world so it is a successor of across the world so it is a successor of across the world so it is a successor of CBRF so if you were familiar with that CBRF so if you were familiar with that CBRF so if you were familiar with that long story short now a lot of companies long story short now a lot of companies long story short now a lot of companies are actually using it and government are actually using it and government are actually using it and government organizations around the world it is an organizations around the world it is an organizations around the world it is an ISO standard it hasn't been fully ISO standard it hasn't been fully ISO standard it hasn't been fully announced because we're working still announced because we're working still announced because we're working still with ISO and actually making it public with ISO and actually making it public with ISO and actually making it public so you don't have to pay for the thing. so you don't have to pay for the thing. so you don't have to pay for the thing. Um, but of course what is a presentation Um, but of course what is a presentation Um, but of course what is a presentation nowadays with our Gibli generated image. nowadays with our Gibli generated image. nowadays with our Gibli generated image. So what I want to actually do is at So what I want to actually do is at So what I want to actually do is at least start going over what is new in least start going over what is new in least start going over what is new in the newer version that we're working on the newer version that we're working on the newer version that we're working on as we speak. Kind of hot off the oven as we speak. Kind of hot off the oven as we speak. Kind of hot off the oven but it's still in the oven. I haven't, but it's still in the oven. I haven't, but it's still in the oven. I haven't, you know, we haven't brought up the you know, we haven't brought up the you know, we haven't brought up the whole cake out but some of the things whole cake out but some of the things whole cake out but some of the things that actually are coming and that were that actually are coming and that were that actually are coming and that were completely overdue. One of them um of completely overdue. One of them um of completely overdue. One of them um of course is enhancements to the schema course is enhancements to the schema course is enhancements to the schema itself. So if you're not familiar with itself. So if you're not familiar with itself. So if you're not familiar with CESF, we have the main schema. Think CESF, we have the main schema. Think CESF, we have the main schema. Think about your security advisory. And that about your security advisory. And that about your security advisory. And that schema has different profiles. Has a schema has different profiles. Has a schema has different profiles. Has a profile for VEX profile for uh generic profile for VEX profile for uh generic profile for VEX profile for uh generic or traditional security or traditional security or traditional security advisories, profile for even advisories, profile for even advisories, profile for even incidents that you want to actually incidents that you want to actually incidents that you want to actually report that are not security report that are not security report that are not security vulnerabilities. Um and so on. So that's vulnerabilities. Um and so on. So that's vulnerabilities. Um and so on. So that's the core schema. We also need a way that the core schema. We also need a way that the core schema. We also need a way that you can you can you can discover these discover these discover these documents also using machine readable documents also using machine readable documents also using machine readable content. So there's a pro provider content. So there's a pro provider content. So there's a pro provider metadata and where if you know the metadata and where if you know the metadata and where if you know the vendor is actually putting this into a vendor is actually putting this into a vendor is actually putting this into a well-known file or well-known structure well-known file or well-known structure well-known file or well-known structure for those of you that are familiar with for those of you that are familiar with for those of you that are familiar with that it's a standard another standard that it's a standard another standard that it's a standard another standard yet another one um that one where yet another one um that one where yet another one um that one where through your nameace or your domain you through your nameace or your domain you through your nameace or your domain you can say cisco.com or can say cisco.com or can say cisco.com or redhead.com.wellnown and then in there redhead.com.wellnown and then in there redhead.com.wellnown and then in there you can have your provider metadata so you can have your provider metadata so you can have your provider metadata so your CESAP provider metadata your your CESAP provider metadata your your CESAP provider metadata your security.ext text you know a lot of security.ext text you know a lot of security.ext text you know a lot of different standards are now being different standards are now being different standards are now being incorporated in that structure and then incorporated in that structure and then incorporated in that structure and then if I am a person whether it's a consumer if I am a person whether it's a consumer if I am a person whether it's a consumer a coordinator a security researcher and a coordinator a security researcher and a coordinator a security researcher and so on I can go to that uh predictable so on I can go to that uh predictable so on I can go to that uh predictable URL and then I can discover where you're URL and then I can discover where you're URL and then I can discover where you're putting the security vulnerabilities putting the security vulnerabilities putting the security vulnerabilities because the problem in the past is not because the problem in the past is not because the problem in the past is not just to have a pretty JSON document that just to have a pretty JSON document that just to have a pretty JSON document that is somewhere that you cannot find is somewhere that you cannot find is somewhere that you cannot find anywhere is is actually finding the anywhere is is actually finding the anywhere is is actually finding the thing right and then there's also the thing right and then there's also the thing right and then there's also the personas of coordinators and also uh personas of coordinators and also uh personas of coordinators and also uh governments like BSI and so on that they governments like BSI and so on that they governments like BSI and so on that they also have aggregation and listing agents also have aggregation and listing agents also have aggregation and listing agents uh but I'm going to skip that because uh but I'm going to skip that because uh but I'm going to skip that because most of you are either a vendor or a most of you are either a vendor or a most of you are either a vendor or a consumer how many of you are a consumer how many of you are a consumer how many of you are a coordinator coordinator coordinator agency only one so sorry you're the agency only one so sorry you're the agency only one so sorry you're the minority so I'm going to skip some of minority so I'm going to skip some of minority so I'm going to skip some of the elements in that but I'll I'll the elements in that but I'll I'll the elements in that but I'll I'll highlight a few things one was super highlight a few things one was super highlight a few things one was super overdue it was actually to you know we overdue it was actually to you know we overdue it was actually to you know we talked about modernizing which talked about modernizing which talked about modernizing which modernizes the standard to catch up with modernizes the standard to catch up with modernizes the standard to catch up with the new TLP super easy right so two 21 the new TLP super easy right so two 21 the new TLP super easy right so two 21 supports that the other one is a supports that the other one is a supports that the other one is a publisher object so in 2.1 the publisher publisher object so in 2.1 the publisher publisher object so in 2.1 the publisher object uh category object uh category object uh category enumeration is now expanded to uh enumeration is now expanded to uh enumeration is now expanded to uh include multip multiplier so multiple include multip multiplier so multiple include multip multiplier so multiple alongside the the values of what I just alongside the the values of what I just alongside the the values of what I just mentioned before of coordinator discover mentioned before of coordinator discover mentioned before of coordinator discover think of it like a security researcher think of it like a security researcher think of it like a security researcher or any other type of category. So this or any other type of category. So this or any other type of category. So this is actually new that didn't exist at all is actually new that didn't exist at all is actually new that didn't exist at all in CSF 2.0 and specifically whenever now in CSF 2.0 and specifically whenever now in CSF 2.0 and specifically whenever now you have different personas and you have different personas and you have different personas and different use cases for using this type different use cases for using this type different use cases for using this type of information a security advisory that of information a security advisory that of information a security advisory that a vendor or security researcher actually a vendor or security researcher actually a vendor or security researcher actually will will create. you know, we needed to will will create. you know, we needed to will will create. you know, we needed to identify what is actually the not only identify what is actually the not only identify what is actually the not only the provider but what is it the persona the provider but what is it the persona the provider but what is it the persona that was actually now um you know engage that was actually now um you know engage that was actually now um you know engage in the creation of this document. The in the creation of this document. The in the creation of this document. The other one is in the product other one is in the product other one is in the product identifications. We talked identifications. We talked identifications. We talked about sbumps and I think that you about sbumps and I think that you about sbumps and I think that you started actually the conversation just started actually the conversation just started actually the conversation just 30 minutes ago. We're talking about 30 minutes ago. We're talking about 30 minutes ago. We're talking about sbombs. We're talking about end of life sbombs. We're talking about end of life sbombs. We're talking about end of life which is the second part of the which is the second part of the which is the second part of the conversation here. But conversation here. But conversation here. But um a lot of people actually ask so are um a lot of people actually ask so are um a lot of people actually ask so are you trying to actually do another sbomb you trying to actually do another sbomb you trying to actually do another sbomb or are you trying to actually reinvent or are you trying to actually reinvent or are you trying to actually reinvent the wheel and the short answer is no the wheel and the short answer is no the wheel and the short answer is no right and uh but we have to have some right and uh but we have to have some right and uh but we have to have some type of program identifiers to say what type of program identifiers to say what type of program identifiers to say what this vulnerability affects right now this vulnerability affects right now this vulnerability affects right now CESF not in 2.1 but in 2.0 We actually CESF not in 2.1 but in 2.0 We actually CESF not in 2.1 but in 2.0 We actually included the support for ESBOM included the support for ESBOM included the support for ESBOM references specifically for the profile references specifically for the profile references specifically for the profile or the use case of VEX the vulnerability or the use case of VEX the vulnerability or the use case of VEX the vulnerability explorability exchange. How many of you explorability exchange. How many of you explorability exchange. How many of you are familiar with VEX? Okay, perfect. So are familiar with VEX? Okay, perfect. So are familiar with VEX? Okay, perfect. So if you're using VEX of course you can if you're using VEX of course you can if you're using VEX of course you can actually refer to uh point in time I actually refer to uh point in time I actually refer to uh point in time I already call it point in time you know already call it point in time you know already call it point in time you know sbomb like a cyclone DX or um SPDX uh sbomb like a cyclone DX or um SPDX uh sbomb like a cyclone DX or um SPDX uh format uh document even though there's format uh document even though there's format uh document even though there's actually you know implementations within actually you know implementations within actually you know implementations within that we actually support that as a that we actually support that as a that we actually support that as a profiling vex so a lot of people got profiling vex so a lot of people got profiling vex so a lot of people got confused whenever we started actually confused whenever we started actually confused whenever we started actually saying product identification whether saying product identification whether saying product identification whether it's for a vex document for a it's for a vex document for a it's for a vex document for a traditional security advisory and so on traditional security advisory and so on traditional security advisory and so on we're not trying to reinvent the wheel we're not trying to reinvent the wheel we're not trying to reinvent the wheel with an Sbomb. We can absolutely make a with an Sbomb. We can absolutely make a with an Sbomb. We can absolutely make a reference to that. But again, we have to reference to that. But again, we have to reference to that. But again, we have to actually say this vulnerability affects actually say this vulnerability affects actually say this vulnerability affects something and that something has to be something and that something has to be something and that something has to be identified somewhat. In to the one we're identified somewhat. In to the one we're identified somewhat. In to the one we're actually making and continue to make actually making and continue to make actually making and continue to make different enhancements different enhancements different enhancements uh a couple of things is renaming uh uh a couple of things is renaming uh uh a couple of things is renaming uh things to be a more aligned with other things to be a more aligned with other things to be a more aligned with other standards for identifying that product. standards for identifying that product. standards for identifying that product. Uh how many of you are familiar with Uh how many of you are familiar with Uh how many of you are familiar with Pearl? Okay, so most of you so of course Pearl? Okay, so most of you so of course Pearl? Okay, so most of you so of course support for Pearl uh is actually one in support for Pearl uh is actually one in support for Pearl uh is actually one in the CISF 2.0 we actually have singular the CISF 2.0 we actually have singular the CISF 2.0 we actually have singular now we actually can have multiple and an now we actually can have multiple and an now we actually can have multiple and an array that requires that. Um the other array that requires that. Um the other array that requires that. Um the other thing that we actually enhance is the thing that we actually enhance is the thing that we actually enhance is the vulnerability vulnerability vulnerability representation so or sorry the weakness representation so or sorry the weakness representation so or sorry the weakness representation so a plural of CWES representation so a plural of CWES representation so a plural of CWES because in many cases you will have not because in many cases you will have not because in many cases you will have not just one CWE. So that was a very big just one CWE. So that was a very big just one CWE. So that was a very big limitation of CESAF in the past limitation of CESAF in the past limitation of CESAF in the past especially for us in at especially for us in at especially for us in at Cisco that um that in many cases Cisco that um that in many cases Cisco that um that in many cases actually we have um multiple actually we have um multiple actually we have um multiple vulnerabilities in in a in a security vulnerabilities in in a in a security vulnerabilities in in a in a security advisory and some of them may actually advisory and some of them may actually advisory and some of them may actually have their own CWE right or one have their own CWE right or one have their own CWE right or one vulnerability can also have multiple vulnerability can also have multiple vulnerability can also have multiple CWEs as well. The other thing is the CWEs as well. The other thing is the CWEs as well. The other thing is the date field. I'm not going to bore you to date field. I'm not going to bore you to date field. I'm not going to bore you to death but we actually making death but we actually making death but we actually making enhancements of that specifically to the enhancements of that specifically to the enhancements of that specifically to the disclosure and the discovery date. a lot disclosure and the discovery date. a lot disclosure and the discovery date. a lot of um even vendors but other of um even vendors but other of um even vendors but other coordination agencies and even the coordination agencies and even the coordination agencies and even the consumers asked when this vulnerability consumers asked when this vulnerability consumers asked when this vulnerability was discovered and what was actually was discovered and what was actually was discovered and what was actually disclosed right and um we didn't have disclosed right and um we didn't have disclosed right and um we didn't have that support I'm not going to go into that support I'm not going to go into that support I'm not going to go into the politics of that but you know um we the politics of that but you know um we the politics of that but you know um we didn't have that support in the standard didn't have that support in the standard didn't have that support in the standard there's definitely a lot of use cases there's definitely a lot of use cases there's definitely a lot of use cases for that in the industry the other thing for that in the industry the other thing for that in the industry the other thing is we changed from just calling is we changed from just calling is we changed from just calling CVSS and just focusing on CVSS for CVSS and just focusing on CVSS for CVSS and just focusing on CVSS for scoring but we now are calling it scoring but we now are calling it scoring but we now are calling it metrics. Why? Because you also have metrics. Why? Because you also have metrics. Why? Because you also have things like um SSVC right that we things like um SSVC right that we things like um SSVC right that we started actually supporting and one of started actually supporting and one of started actually supporting and one of the um use cases for that. It was for the um use cases for that. It was for the um use cases for that. It was for coordination agencies that also are coordination agencies that also are coordination agencies that also are using this and of course enterprises using this and of course enterprises using this and of course enterprises that are consuming this information are that are consuming this information are that are consuming this information are trying to prioritize based on a decision trying to prioritize based on a decision trying to prioritize based on a decision tree on how they should respond to a tree on how they should respond to a tree on how they should respond to a given vulnerability. So we now we have given vulnerability. So we now we have given vulnerability. So we now we have support of course for CBSS support of course for CBSS support of course for CBSS uh for the row which is overdue but also uh for the row which is overdue but also uh for the row which is overdue but also support for SSVC as support for SSVC as support for SSVC as well. Few remediation enhancements that well. Few remediation enhancements that well. Few remediation enhancements that we have uh especially around the we have uh especially around the we have uh especially around the remediation property and category remediation property and category remediation property and category enumeration that we introduced uh within enumeration that we introduced uh within enumeration that we introduced uh within the standard. I mean I'm going to go the standard. I mean I'm going to go the standard. I mean I'm going to go really quick on this. All these slides really quick on this. All these slides really quick on this. All these slides are going to be posted and as a matter are going to be posted and as a matter are going to be posted and as a matter of fact all this is being documented as of fact all this is being documented as of fact all this is being documented as we speak uh 2.1 just I should have we speak uh 2.1 just I should have we speak uh 2.1 just I should have started with that is not out yet but we started with that is not out yet but we started with that is not out yet but we are actually working pretty hard are actually working pretty hard are actually working pretty hard especially this gentleman right here on especially this gentleman right here on especially this gentleman right here on a lot of the final tweaks for the a lot of the final tweaks for the a lot of the final tweaks for the schemas and also the committee spe schemas and also the committee spe schemas and also the committee spe community specification draft. What does community specification draft. What does community specification draft. What does that mean? Whenever you have an Oasis that mean? Whenever you have an Oasis that mean? Whenever you have an Oasis standard, you first write the draft for standard, you first write the draft for standard, you first write the draft for that we call a community specification that we call a community specification that we call a community specification and then you have all the member and then you have all the member and then you have all the member companies and member organizations companies and member organizations companies and member organizations within Oasis review that then we do a within Oasis review that then we do a within Oasis review that then we do a public review. So we get feedback from public review. So we get feedback from public review. So we get feedback from the public and then after that there's the public and then after that there's the public and then after that there's some voting you know in between that I'm some voting you know in between that I'm some voting you know in between that I'm skipping a lot of things but then after skipping a lot of things but then after skipping a lot of things but then after that you actually release the standard. that you actually release the standard. that you actually release the standard. Once the standard is out, then we also Once the standard is out, then we also Once the standard is out, then we also vote whether you want to actually submit vote whether you want to actually submit vote whether you want to actually submit it to ISO and so on, right? So, it's a it to ISO and so on, right? So, it's a it to ISO and so on, right? So, it's a pretty intense process. We're in the pretty intense process. We're in the pretty intense process. We're in the middle of actually middle of actually middle of actually um pretty soon uh creating the community um pretty soon uh creating the community um pretty soon uh creating the community specification draft for that. How many specification draft for that. How many specification draft for that. How many of you use of you use of you use Rolley? How many of you know what Rolley Rolley? How many of you know what Rolley Rolley? How many of you know what Rolley is? Awesome. Only one actually. Can you is? Awesome. Only one actually. Can you is? Awesome. Only one actually. Can you explain what Rolley is? explain what Rolley is? explain what Rolley is? Um it's an RFC I was made aware of by Um it's an RFC I was made aware of by Um it's an RFC I was made aware of by Redhead. Um when we initially introduced Redhead. Um when we initially introduced Redhead. Um when we initially introduced the distribution logic into CESAF the distribution logic into CESAF the distribution logic into CESAF um it was built for um lightweight um it was built for um lightweight um it was built for um lightweight information exchange of security information exchange of security information exchange of security information and basically it works like information and basically it works like information and basically it works like an atom publishing um feed uh which you an atom publishing um feed uh which you an atom publishing um feed uh which you can use to announce your sec uh the can use to announce your sec uh the can use to announce your sec uh the location of your security advisories. location of your security advisories. location of your security advisories. Thank you. So in CISA for those of you Thank you. So in CISA for those of you Thank you. So in CISA for those of you that don't know we actually support that don't know we actually support that don't know we actually support directory listing. So you can you know directory listing. So you can you know directory listing. So you can you know vendors can actually publish that in a vendors can actually publish that in a vendors can actually publish that in a normal directory. Some organizations normal directory. Some organizations normal directory. Some organizations including CISA know the CISA and CISA including CISA know the CISA and CISA including CISA know the CISA and CISA but including CISA they actually use but including CISA they actually use but including CISA they actually use even GitHub and they have directory even GitHub and they have directory even GitHub and they have directory listing and you can get the information listing and you can get the information listing and you can get the information from there. Rolley is a I would call it from there. Rolley is a I would call it from there. Rolley is a I would call it more proper standard. is an RFC, right? more proper standard. is an RFC, right? more proper standard. is an RFC, right? And in that case, the amazing part is And in that case, the amazing part is And in that case, the amazing part is actually discoverability, which is the actually discoverability, which is the actually discoverability, which is the thing that I'm honing the most in here thing that I'm honing the most in here thing that I'm honing the most in here because we can have the perfect because we can have the perfect because we can have the perfect standard, but if nobody actually can standard, but if nobody actually can standard, but if nobody actually can find it, that will be, you know, is a find it, that will be, you know, is a find it, that will be, you know, is a mood point. Uh, we did some enhancements mood point. Uh, we did some enhancements mood point. Uh, we did some enhancements for public PGP key. So, as you see, you for public PGP key. So, as you see, you for public PGP key. So, as you see, you know, there's a lot of new enhancements know, there's a lot of new enhancements know, there's a lot of new enhancements to the to the standard per se. And uh to the to the standard per se. And uh to the to the standard per se. And uh I'm going to pause for a second before I I'm going to pause for a second before I I'm going to pause for a second before I shift to to open EOX, but I'm going to shift to to open EOX, but I'm going to shift to to open EOX, but I'm going to start with a couple of questions. How start with a couple of questions. How start with a couple of questions. How many of you already use many of you already use many of you already use CES? That's great. So So it's about 45 CES? That's great. So So it's about 45 CES? That's great. So So it's about 45 50% of the of the room right now. For 50% of the of the room right now. For 50% of the of the room right now. For those that use CESF, are you how many of those that use CESF, are you how many of those that use CESF, are you how many of you are you are you are vendors? How many of you are consumers vendors? How many of you are consumers vendors? How many of you are consumers of CESF? Amazing. Wow. Excellent. So, as of CESF? Amazing. Wow. Excellent. So, as of CESF? Amazing. Wow. Excellent. So, as as you know, just like any other as you know, just like any other as you know, just like any other standard, one of the main things that standard, one of the main things that standard, one of the main things that we're trying to do is is drive adoption. we're trying to do is is drive adoption. we're trying to do is is drive adoption. But adoption is of just pointing But adoption is of just pointing But adoption is of just pointing somebody to read a specification, that somebody to read a specification, that somebody to read a specification, that doesn't work like that, right? So, we doesn't work like that, right? So, we doesn't work like that, right? So, we have to have to have to um build tools whether you are a vendor, um build tools whether you are a vendor, um build tools whether you are a vendor, a security vendor, and you don't even a security vendor, and you don't even a security vendor, and you don't even know what CISAF is or you have struggled know what CISAF is or you have struggled know what CISAF is or you have struggled to actually put CISAP, please contact to actually put CISAP, please contact to actually put CISAP, please contact us. We want to actually talk to you us. We want to actually talk to you us. We want to actually talk to you because u again adoption is number one because u again adoption is number one because u again adoption is number one thing and we actually have seen adoption thing and we actually have seen adoption thing and we actually have seen adoption significantly increase in in ces in the significantly increase in in ces in the significantly increase in in ces in the last few actually maybe even months. Uh last few actually maybe even months. Uh last few actually maybe even months. Uh but we need more right. The other uh but we need more right. The other uh but we need more right. The other uh thing that I wanted to actually discuss thing that I wanted to actually discuss thing that I wanted to actually discuss is something that rogue was introducing is something that rogue was introducing is something that rogue was introducing his presentation. So this section is his presentation. So this section is his presentation. So this section is going to be way shorter because you got going to be way shorter because you got going to be way shorter because you got a preview of that. But how many of you a preview of that. But how many of you a preview of that. But how many of you have heard before his presentation about have heard before his presentation about have heard before his presentation about open open open EOX? Okay. So, uh just a few. So, Open EOX? Okay. So, uh just a few. So, Open EOX? Okay. So, uh just a few. So, Open EOX is actually something that um during EOX is actually something that um during EOX is actually something that um during RSA, I think the whole the whole thing RSA, I think the whole the whole thing RSA, I think the whole the whole thing was in RSA. Thomas and myself, we were was in RSA. Thomas and myself, we were was in RSA. Thomas and myself, we were actually talking about CISF and VEX and actually talking about CISF and VEX and actually talking about CISF and VEX and then through the it was a vendor meeting then through the it was a vendor meeting then through the it was a vendor meeting with Cert and we were actually with Cert and we were actually with Cert and we were actually exchanging just ideas and we said oh now exchanging just ideas and we said oh now exchanging just ideas and we said oh now Sbumps are not done like I'm not talking Sbumps are not done like I'm not talking Sbumps are not done like I'm not talking about this the problem we solve but you about this the problem we solve but you about this the problem we solve but you know we're done with standards for know we're done with standards for know we're done with standards for Sbumps and we have now standards for VEX Sbumps and we have now standards for VEX Sbumps and we have now standards for VEX and we were joking it's like what else and we were joking it's like what else and we were joking it's like what else is there to to is there to to is there to to And there are two things that were And there are two things that were And there are two things that were crucial. Bruce can crucial. Bruce can crucial. Bruce can actually laugh now. One is naming actually laugh now. One is naming actually laugh now. One is naming conventions. And I went like there's no conventions. And I went like there's no conventions. And I went like there's no way I'm going to actually try to fix way I'm going to actually try to fix way I'm going to actually try to fix that one. So that's that's you guys. The that one. So that's that's you guys. The that one. So that's that's you guys. The second one second one second one was in the age of AI, we don't even have was in the age of AI, we don't even have was in the age of AI, we don't even have a single way to even say what is end of a single way to even say what is end of a single way to even say what is end of support. support. support. Forget about end of sales, end of Forget about end of sales, end of Forget about end of sales, end of software maintenance, end of everything. software maintenance, end of everything. software maintenance, end of everything. What is supported that is What is supported that is What is supported that is machine readable that I can feed whether machine readable that I can feed whether machine readable that I can feed whether it's through an AI model or through my it's through an AI model or through my it's through an AI model or through my Python script glorified Python script Python script glorified Python script Python script glorified Python script that now I call an agent, right? Uh to that now I call an agent, right? Uh to that now I call an agent, right? Uh to do something with it. There's didn't do something with it. There's didn't do something with it. There's didn't assist. So in that case like hey let's assist. So in that case like hey let's assist. So in that case like hey let's actually do this and we you know of actually do this and we you know of actually do this and we you know of course we have the arm from from o from course we have the arm from from o from course we have the arm from from o from Oasis and we decided hey let's actually Oasis and we decided hey let's actually Oasis and we decided hey let's actually launch a TC and there's lot of amazing launch a TC and there's lot of amazing launch a TC and there's lot of amazing participation and thank you to Red Hat participation and thank you to Red Hat participation and thank you to Red Hat Dell um many organizations are actually Dell um many organizations are actually Dell um many organizations are actually now participant and of course CISA BSI now participant and of course CISA BSI now participant and of course CISA BSI and so on but the challenge that we were and so on but the challenge that we were and so on but the challenge that we were facing is that even within a vendor and facing is that even within a vendor and facing is that even within a vendor and I'm going to point fingers just to me I'm going to point fingers just to me I'm going to point fingers just to me Right? Even within Cisco like if you Right? Even within Cisco like if you Right? Even within Cisco like if you look we grow through acquisitions. look we grow through acquisitions. look we grow through acquisitions. Right? So you have Splunking here with Right? So you have Splunking here with Right? So you have Splunking here with their own version of end of life and of their own version of end of life and of their own version of end of life and of support. You have Maro with their own support. You have Maro with their own support. You have Maro with their own version of and of support. You have version of and of support. You have version of and of support. You have enterprise networking with their own enterprise networking with their own enterprise networking with their own version of end of life support. Now you version of end of life support. Now you version of end of life support. Now you have security BU with their own have security BU with their own have security BU with their own interpretation. There's even in one interpretation. There's even in one interpretation. There's even in one company I need a standardization. Right? company I need a standardization. Right? company I need a standardization. Right? So the first thing that we have to do is So the first thing that we have to do is So the first thing that we have to do is take care of the taxonomy. So everybody take care of the taxonomy. So everybody take care of the taxonomy. So everybody will know what is actually what and what will know what is actually what and what will know what is actually what and what is um you know end of life and of is um you know end of life and of is um you know end of life and of support and so on. So that's where we support and so on. So that's where we support and so on. So that's where we concentrated I probably say the last you concentrated I probably say the last you concentrated I probably say the last you know four five months at least six five know four five months at least six five know four five months at least six five six months of uh probably even more yeah six months of uh probably even more yeah six months of uh probably even more yeah of just getting the definitions ready. of just getting the definitions ready. of just getting the definitions ready. And as a matter of fact, tomorrow and And as a matter of fact, tomorrow and And as a matter of fact, tomorrow and Thursday, I'm bringing a few of you to Thursday, I'm bringing a few of you to Thursday, I'm bringing a few of you to Cisco to put them in a room to actually Cisco to put them in a room to actually Cisco to put them in a room to actually finish this thing. finish this thing. finish this thing. Right? So, we have to figure that out Right? So, we have to figure that out Right? So, we have to figure that out because that is crucial. I can have a because that is crucial. I can have a because that is crucial. I can have a beautiful schema. Anybody can have a beautiful schema. Anybody can have a beautiful schema. Anybody can have a GitHub repository with their own GitHub repository with their own GitHub repository with their own implementation. I already have APIs at implementation. I already have APIs at implementation. I already have APIs at Cisco. I don't need this thing. I can Cisco. I don't need this thing. I can Cisco. I don't need this thing. I can just expose it. But whenever it comes to just expose it. But whenever it comes to just expose it. But whenever it comes to open source, if I want to actually open source, if I want to actually open source, if I want to actually block things that my developers should block things that my developers should block things that my developers should not be using because it's n of port what not be using because it's n of port what not be using because it's n of port what we call end of support which is sub we call end of support which is sub we call end of support which is sub subjective in in in open source we need subjective in in in open source we need subjective in in in open source we need that right and especially this also that right and especially this also that right and especially this also apply to the emerging technologies that apply to the emerging technologies that apply to the emerging technologies that we're creating right now including AI we're creating right now including AI we're creating right now including AI models. models. models. what is an support structure for an open what is an support structure for an open what is an support structure for an open weight model in hugging face there's weight model in hugging face there's weight model in hugging face there's none right so um so definitely the need none right so um so definitely the need none right so um so definitely the need is there so we have we need the common is there so we have we need the common is there so we have we need the common definitions we not need to focus in definitions we not need to focus in definitions we not need to focus in automation not just delivering this to a automation not just delivering this to a automation not just delivering this to a human and many of the standards that are human and many of the standards that are human and many of the standards that are machine readable including sbombs it is machine readable including sbombs it is machine readable including sbombs it is so sad that we're giving that document a so sad that we're giving that document a so sad that we're giving that document a JSON file to a human Right? So we need JSON file to a human Right? So we need JSON file to a human Right? So we need to divorce from that. The other one is to divorce from that. The other one is to divorce from that. The other one is of course transparency to be machine of course transparency to be machine of course transparency to be machine readable and international readable and international readable and international standardization. So the goal here is to standardization. So the goal here is to standardization. So the goal here is to have a lightweight schema that if you have a lightweight schema that if you have a lightweight schema that if you want to just do this in want to just do this in want to just do this in isolation that you want to create an API isolation that you want to create an API isolation that you want to create an API or you know some type of directory or you know some type of directory or you know some type of directory enumeration whatever the case will be enumeration whatever the case will be enumeration whatever the case will be you know we'll we'll figure out that at you know we'll we'll figure out that at you know we'll we'll figure out that at least you can tell what is the minimum least you can tell what is the minimum least you can tell what is the minimum requirement of an end of life the end of requirement of an end of life the end of requirement of an end of life the end of the life of a product. So support and so the life of a product. So support and so the life of a product. So support and so on that can then be incorporated. So do on that can then be incorporated. So do on that can then be incorporated. So do not reinvent the wheel in an asbomb in a not reinvent the wheel in an asbomb in a not reinvent the wheel in an asbomb in a security advisory and so on. But we need security advisory and so on. But we need security advisory and so on. But we need to have light that very lightweight to have light that very lightweight to have light that very lightweight schema but more importantly the common schema but more importantly the common schema but more importantly the common taxonomy behind it based on all the use taxonomy behind it based on all the use taxonomy behind it based on all the use cases that we're getting and then cases that we're getting and then cases that we're getting and then incorporate this you know across the incorporate this you know across the incorporate this you know across the standard. So it's not reinventing the standard. So it's not reinventing the standard. So it's not reinventing the wheel with another standard is actually wheel with another standard is actually wheel with another standard is actually in including that the common taxonomy in including that the common taxonomy in including that the common taxonomy and so on. So we actually have a and so on. So we actually have a and so on. So we actually have a workshop even though it's for the uh workshop even though it's for the uh workshop even though it's for the uh members organizations but if you're members organizations but if you're members organizations but if you're interested on even collaborating and so interested on even collaborating and so interested on even collaborating and so on this is all public on this is all public on this is all public um in GitHub and before my GPUs you know um in GitHub and before my GPUs you know um in GitHub and before my GPUs you know kill me because I generated a whole kill me because I generated a whole kill me because I generated a whole bunch of AI generated bunch of AI generated bunch of AI generated images I know that I have like five images I know that I have like five images I know that I have like five minutes uh two minutes any super fast minutes uh two minutes any super fast minutes uh two minutes any super fast questions Yes. Yeah. Uh yes, thank you for Yeah. Uh yes, thank you for Yeah. Uh yes, thank you for presentation. Really great presentation. presentation. Really great presentation. presentation. Really great presentation. Um Sergi from Corona Cisco team. Um so Um Sergi from Corona Cisco team. Um so Um Sergi from Corona Cisco team. Um so this format of cesaf 2.1 I was checking this format of cesaf 2.1 I was checking this format of cesaf 2.1 I was checking for the product status details and for the product status details and for the product status details and actually in vex documentation there is actually in vex documentation there is actually in vex documentation there is like this four major four statuses and like this four major four statuses and like this four major four statuses and additional statuses. Is there a plan to additional statuses. Is there a plan to additional statuses. Is there a plan to develop more statuses because even uh as develop more statuses because even uh as develop more statuses because even uh as of today we see that those statuses is of today we see that those statuses is of today we see that those statuses is not enough to describe all this dynamic not enough to describe all this dynamic not enough to describe all this dynamic structure of of the vex disposition data structure of of the vex disposition data structure of of the vex disposition data that we ingest and it's just like not that we ingest and it's just like not that we ingest and it's just like not enough. That's like first question and enough. That's like first question and enough. That's like first question and uh I was just checking this uh this is uh I was just checking this uh this is uh I was just checking this uh this is like amazing actually we are looking like amazing actually we are looking like amazing actually we are looking right now in this contribution between right now in this contribution between right now in this contribution between asbomb ux data and if there will be like asbomb ux data and if there will be like asbomb ux data and if there will be like this synergy that we can put a this synergy that we can put a this synergy that we can put a connections between them that will is connections between them that will is connections between them that will is great. So how uh nowadays we can great. So how uh nowadays we can great. So how uh nowadays we can contribute to this standard maybe and contribute to this standard maybe and contribute to this standard maybe and what this standard is actually like uh what this standard is actually like uh what this standard is actually like uh how the standard is actually described how the standard is actually described how the standard is actually described this connection between asbomb um vex this connection between asbomb um vex this connection between asbomb um vex segmentation and vex standards and the segmentation and vex standards and the segmentation and vex standards and the obviously uh end of life data. Thank obviously uh end of life data. Thank obviously uh end of life data. Thank you. Yeah absolutely. I'm going to start you. Yeah absolutely. I'm going to start you. Yeah absolutely. I'm going to start with the second part of your question with the second part of your question with the second part of your question which is should we synchronize this abs which is should we synchronize this abs which is should we synchronize this abs 100%. 100%. 100%. is imperative. If not, you know, it's is imperative. If not, you know, it's is imperative. If not, you know, it's going to be still continue wild west out going to be still continue wild west out going to be still continue wild west out there. How can you contribute to it? there. How can you contribute to it? there. How can you contribute to it? Open Open Open ax.org. If not, you know, ping me ax.org. If not, you know, ping me ax.org. If not, you know, ping me directly oscisco.com is my email directly oscisco.com is my email directly oscisco.com is my email address. Um, you know, etc. And even in address. Um, you know, etc. And even in address. Um, you know, etc. And even in the oas the oas the oas omar.santoso.org. Uh, believe me, I'm omar.santoso.org. Uh, believe me, I'm omar.santoso.org. Uh, believe me, I'm try I'm begging everybody to actually try I'm begging everybody to actually try I'm begging everybody to actually synchronize, you know, these type of synchronize, you know, these type of synchronize, you know, these type of efforts because it costs money. You efforts because it costs money. You efforts because it costs money. You know, I got people assigned to these know, I got people assigned to these know, I got people assigned to these places. So, we have to we have to places. So, we have to we have to places. So, we have to we have to actually minimize the cost as well. But actually minimize the cost as well. But actually minimize the cost as well. But besides that, the second thing or the besides that, the second thing or the besides that, the second thing or the first the first part of your question first the first part of your question first the first part of your question related to additional uh statuses. So related to additional uh statuses. So related to additional uh statuses. So for those of you that are not familiar for those of you that are not familiar for those of you that are not familiar with the VEX statuses, you know, under with the VEX statuses, you know, under with the VEX statuses, you know, under investigation, I'm an affected, not investigation, I'm an affected, not investigation, I'm an affected, not affected, and of course affected, and of course affected, and of course fix one that a colleague of ours in here fix one that a colleague of ours in here fix one that a colleague of ours in here is begging for many is begging for many is begging for many time. like you put everything under time. like you put everything under time. like you put everything under investigation but you're not investigation but you're not investigation but you're not investigating you just don't know right investigating you just don't know right investigating you just don't know right and whenever you put this into and whenever you put this into and whenever you put this into investigation you're doing the triage investigation you're doing the triage investigation you're doing the triage you should put that in there so the you should put that in there so the you should put that in there so the short answer is yes we're actually short answer is yes we're actually short answer is yes we're actually getting additional fields we're trying getting additional fields we're trying getting additional fields we're trying to coordinate because it's not only to coordinate because it's not only to coordinate because it's not only CESAF but we probably have to lead it CESAF but we probably have to lead it CESAF but we probably have to lead it through CESF um but VEX you know it's a through CESF um but VEX you know it's a through CESF um but VEX you know it's a bigger ecosystem there's other you know bigger ecosystem there's other you know bigger ecosystem there's other you know standards that's the importance of standards that's the importance of standards that's the importance of collaboration in there but we are collaboration in there but we are collaboration in there but we are definitely evaluating additional fields definitely evaluating additional fields definitely evaluating additional fields in in the standard in in the standard in in the standard And if you have any specific details of And if you have any specific details of And if you have any specific details of use use use cases, everything is delivered by cases, everything is delivered by cases, everything is delivered by GitHub, but also we have a CISAF um man, GitHub, but also we have a CISAF um man, GitHub, but also we have a CISAF um man, I'm drawing a blank now.
