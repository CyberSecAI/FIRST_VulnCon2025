Kind: captions Language: en Cool. Um, hi all and welcome. Uh, as he Cool. Um, hi all and welcome. Uh, as he Cool. Um, hi all and welcome. Uh, as he said, my name is Chris Coffin. I've been said, my name is Chris Coffin. I've been said, my name is Chris Coffin. I've been at the MITER Corporation since 2012 and at the MITER Corporation since 2012 and at the MITER Corporation since 2012 and spent most of my time um, working on the spent most of my time um, working on the spent most of my time um, working on the CVE program in various roles. Um, so I CVE program in various roles. Um, so I CVE program in various roles. Um, so I like to think that I know a little bit like to think that I know a little bit like to think that I know a little bit about CVE and vulnerability management. about CVE and vulnerability management. about CVE and vulnerability management. uh but I'm always surprised how many new uh but I'm always surprised how many new uh but I'm always surprised how many new topics and uh and disciplines uh come my topics and uh and disciplines uh come my topics and uh and disciplines uh come my way um especially during conferences way um especially during conferences way um especially during conferences like this. So one of the things that like this. So one of the things that like this. So one of the things that I've actually been spending a lot of I've actually been spending a lot of I've actually been spending a lot of time on recently is uh the common time on recently is uh the common time on recently is uh the common platform enumeration and more commonly platform enumeration and more commonly platform enumeration and more commonly referred to as CPE. Um so one of the referred to as CPE. Um so one of the referred to as CPE. Um so one of the things that we just recently did in the things that we just recently did in the things that we just recently did in the CBE record format which is our JSON CBE record format which is our JSON CBE record format which is our JSON schema for capturing CBE records um is schema for capturing CBE records um is schema for capturing CBE records um is that we added uh more robust support for that we added uh more robust support for that we added uh more robust support for CPE 2.3 CPE 2.3 CPE 2.3 um and specifically the applicability um and specifically the applicability um and specifically the applicability language for CPE. Um so we're going to language for CPE. Um so we're going to language for CPE. Um so we're going to talk a little bit more about that. I'll talk a little bit more about that. I'll talk a little bit more about that. I'll apologize upfront that we probably can't apologize upfront that we probably can't apologize upfront that we probably can't cover anything in super detail. Um, so cover anything in super detail. Um, so cover anything in super detail. Um, so if you have questions at the end, I'd be if you have questions at the end, I'd be if you have questions at the end, I'd be happy to answer them. And I think we happy to answer them. And I think we happy to answer them. And I think we might have some time later in the might have some time later in the might have some time later in the session too if we want to talk about session too if we want to talk about session too if we want to talk about things in the uh the follow things in the uh the follow things in the uh the follow on Earl CPE session. Um, so anyways, on Earl CPE session. Um, so anyways, on Earl CPE session. Um, so anyways, what are we going to try and cover what are we going to try and cover what are we going to try and cover today? Um, what is CPE? We'll get today? Um, what is CPE? We'll get today? Um, what is CPE? We'll get through that quickly because I'm sure through that quickly because I'm sure through that quickly because I'm sure most of you know what CPE is, but I want most of you know what CPE is, but I want most of you know what CPE is, but I want to make sure we cover all the bases. Um, to make sure we cover all the bases. Um, to make sure we cover all the bases. Um, why do we want to include CPE in the CBE why do we want to include CPE in the CBE why do we want to include CPE in the CBE record format? Um, what are CPE record format? Um, what are CPE record format? Um, what are CPE applicability statements? Um, what is applicability statements? Um, what is applicability statements? Um, what is the CBE record format? And then we'll the CBE record format? And then we'll the CBE record format? And then we'll look at a number of examples depending look at a number of examples depending look at a number of examples depending on time and how you can actually include on time and how you can actually include on time and how you can actually include CPE today. Um, and obviously we'll take CPE today. Um, and obviously we'll take CPE today. Um, and obviously we'll take some questions. Um, so quickly diving some questions. Um, so quickly diving some questions. Um, so quickly diving in, what is CPE? I'm sure most of you in, what is CPE? I'm sure most of you in, what is CPE? I'm sure most of you know this already um but just to cover know this already um but just to cover know this already um but just to cover it quickly um it is a structured naming it quickly um it is a structured naming it quickly um it is a structured naming scheme for information technology scheme for information technology scheme for information technology systems software and packages also systems software and packages also systems software and packages also platforms um current version is 2.3 it's platforms um current version is 2.3 it's platforms um current version is 2.3 it's was originally released in 2011 was originally released in 2011 was originally released in 2011 um and it is a stack of four um and it is a stack of four um and it is a stack of four specifications specifications specifications um I stole this image from the NVD site um I stole this image from the NVD site um I stole this image from the NVD site um so basically just the uh naming at um so basically just the uh naming at um so basically just the uh naming at the bottom name matching so how do we the bottom name matching so how do we the bottom name matching so how do we match match against CPE names, um, a match match against CPE names, um, a match match against CPE names, um, a dictionary, and then the applicability dictionary, and then the applicability dictionary, and then the applicability language. By the way, if anybody has any language. By the way, if anybody has any language. By the way, if anybody has any questions at any time, feel free to questions at any time, feel free to questions at any time, feel free to raise your hand. raise your hand. raise your hand. Um, I would be happy to to clarify some Um, I would be happy to to clarify some Um, I would be happy to to clarify some things. Um, so CP naming format and things. Um, so CP naming format and things. Um, so CP naming format and examples. Um, the naming format itself examples. Um, the naming format itself examples. Um, the naming format itself starts with CPE colon 2.3. Um, that is starts with CPE colon 2.3. Um, that is starts with CPE colon 2.3. Um, that is fixed. Um and then there are 11 fields fixed. Um and then there are 11 fields fixed. Um and then there are 11 fields to define uh various product to define uh various product to define uh various product identification pieces of data. Um there identification pieces of data. Um there identification pieces of data. Um there are multiple formats for CPE naming that are multiple formats for CPE naming that are multiple formats for CPE naming that are defined in the spec, but the one are defined in the spec, but the one are defined in the spec, but the one that we're interested in and that's that we're interested in and that's that we're interested in and that's commonly used is the formatted string commonly used is the formatted string commonly used is the formatted string binding, which you can see some examples binding, which you can see some examples binding, which you can see some examples um at the bottom there. Um, most um at the bottom there. Um, most um at the bottom there. Um, most commonly fields that you'll see filled commonly fields that you'll see filled commonly fields that you'll see filled out will be the uh um the part which is out will be the uh um the part which is out will be the uh um the part which is really simply just a way to say really simply just a way to say really simply just a way to say applications, hardware or OS. Um, so applications, hardware or OS. Um, so applications, hardware or OS. Um, so it's one of three values and then it's one of three values and then it's one of three values and then following that you'll have the vendor following that you'll have the vendor following that you'll have the vendor then product and then version. Um some then product and then version. Um some then product and then version. Um some of those are also used like addition and of those are also used like addition and of those are also used like addition and language and target hardware and so so language and target hardware and so so language and target hardware and so so on and so forth. But um the stars do on and so forth. But um the stars do on and so forth. But um the stars do represent any value and that comes into represent any value and that comes into represent any value and that comes into play when we start doing name matching. play when we start doing name matching. play when we start doing name matching. Um the stars would represent anything. Um the stars would represent anything. Um the stars would represent anything. So we can talk a little about a little So we can talk a little about a little So we can talk a little about a little bit more about that later. bit more about that later. bit more about that later. Um, so before we move on to the other Um, so before we move on to the other Um, so before we move on to the other definitions and talk about more, um, definitions and talk about more, um, definitions and talk about more, um, somebody pointed out to me the other day somebody pointed out to me the other day somebody pointed out to me the other day that sometimes we get into these that sometimes we get into these that sometimes we get into these conversations and we don't necessarily conversations and we don't necessarily conversations and we don't necessarily talk about why we're discussing this and talk about why we're discussing this and talk about why we're discussing this and what's it what's important and what the what's it what's important and what the what's it what's important and what the problem is we're trying to to solve or problem is we're trying to to solve or problem is we're trying to to solve or the question we're trying to answer. So the question we're trying to answer. So the question we're trying to answer. So why do we want to include CPE within the why do we want to include CPE within the why do we want to include CPE within the CBE record format? Well, Let's give this one a go. All right, that should be go. All right, that should be go. All right, that should be better. Yeah, sounds like better. Yeah, sounds like better. Yeah, sounds like it. No worries. Um, all right. So why do it. No worries. Um, all right. So why do it. No worries. Um, all right. So why do we include CPE within the CBE record we include CPE within the CBE record we include CPE within the CBE record format? Um consumers need obviously a format? Um consumers need obviously a format? Um consumers need obviously a way or a standardized way to identify way or a standardized way to identify way or a standardized way to identify platforms and products um within CBE platforms and products um within CBE platforms and products um within CBE records. Um NIS NVD has used CPE for a records. Um NIS NVD has used CPE for a records. Um NIS NVD has used CPE for a number of years now. Um and people are number of years now. Um and people are number of years now. Um and people are already familiar with that format. Um so already familiar with that format. Um so already familiar with that format. Um so on the CVE side we decided to add the on the CVE side we decided to add the on the CVE side we decided to add the NIST. Basically, it's a mirror of the NIST. Basically, it's a mirror of the NIST. Basically, it's a mirror of the NIST NVD configurations NIST NVD configurations NIST NVD configurations uh JSON schema that they use. So, um uh JSON schema that they use. So, um uh JSON schema that they use. So, um what that allows you to do is define what that allows you to do is define what that allows you to do is define CPEs in the CVE record format using the CPEs in the CVE record format using the CPEs in the CVE record format using the CPE applicability language. Um same way CPE applicability language. Um same way CPE applicability language. Um same way as NVD does today. Now, it is optional. as NVD does today. Now, it is optional. as NVD does today. Now, it is optional. Um it is not required to add CPE data to Um it is not required to add CPE data to Um it is not required to add CPE data to CVE records today. Um but depending on CVE records today. Um but depending on CVE records today. Um but depending on how well it is received um things could how well it is received um things could how well it is received um things could change in the future but it is change in the future but it is change in the future but it is definitely optional today. Um it's still definitely optional today. Um it's still definitely optional today. Um it's still a requirement for producers of CVEEs to a requirement for producers of CVEEs to a requirement for producers of CVEEs to provide um affected product and version provide um affected product and version provide um affected product and version information in the uh affected array as information in the uh affected array as information in the uh affected array as part of the the CVE part of the the CVE part of the the CVE record. Let's go. CP applicability record. Let's go. CP applicability record. Let's go. CP applicability language um defines a standardized language um defines a standardized language um defines a standardized structure for forming complex logical structure for forming complex logical structure for forming complex logical expressions. So basically um the expressions. So basically um the expressions. So basically um the applicability language uses applicability language uses applicability language uses applicability statements to help define applicability statements to help define applicability statements to help define complex relationships of products, complex relationships of products, complex relationships of products, platforms, software, etc. Um so in the platforms, software, etc. Um so in the platforms, software, etc. Um so in the example on the screen you're seeing example on the screen you're seeing example on the screen you're seeing Mozilla Firefox running on Microsoft Mozilla Firefox running on Microsoft Mozilla Firefox running on Microsoft Windows Vista could be tagged and could Windows Vista could be tagged and could Windows Vista could be tagged and could be used with andor to define that it has be used with andor to define that it has be used with andor to define that it has to exist you know Firefox 36 has to to exist you know Firefox 36 has to to exist you know Firefox 36 has to exist on Microsoft Windows Vista in exist on Microsoft Windows Vista in exist on Microsoft Windows Vista in order for the vulnerability to be order for the vulnerability to be order for the vulnerability to be present. present. present. Um so in the CV record format we use the Um so in the CV record format we use the Um so in the CV record format we use the the applicability statements to define the applicability statements to define the applicability statements to define those um and their status with regard to those um and their status with regard to those um and their status with regard to the vulnerability the vulnerability the vulnerability defined. Um so the CVE record format defined. Um so the CVE record format defined. Um so the CVE record format what is it? Um it is what data producers what is it? Um it is what data producers what is it? Um it is what data producers use to define CVE records. Um, and it is use to define CVE records. Um, and it is use to define CVE records. Um, and it is definitely a number of uh pieces of data definitely a number of uh pieces of data definitely a number of uh pieces of data that that help someone or a consumer that that help someone or a consumer that that help someone or a consumer understand what the vulnerability is understand what the vulnerability is understand what the vulnerability is that's being described. Um, that's being described. Um, that's being described. Um, so some examples, let's see, hold on. CBA applicability statements can uh can CBA applicability statements can uh can CBA applicability statements can uh can be included in the uh in the 5.1.1 be included in the uh in the 5.1.1 be included in the uh in the 5.1.1 release um which was recently rec release um which was recently rec release um which was recently rec recently released. Um and I didn't recently released. Um and I didn't recently released. Um and I didn't actually grab the date of this. Sorry. actually grab the date of this. Sorry. actually grab the date of this. Sorry. Um but yeah, it's been a it's been out Um but yeah, it's been a it's been out Um but yeah, it's been a it's been out for a couple of months now. Um it does, for a couple of months now. Um it does, for a couple of months now. Um it does, like I said, closely resemble the NIST like I said, closely resemble the NIST like I said, closely resemble the NIST NVD applicability statements in their NVD applicability statements in their NVD applicability statements in their configurations configurations configurations uh JSON. uh JSON. uh JSON. Um, so one of the things that I realized Um, so one of the things that I realized Um, so one of the things that I realized as we were implementing this was as we were implementing this was as we were implementing this was that Zenist NVD does have a website that that Zenist NVD does have a website that that Zenist NVD does have a website that a lot of folks use that describes a lot of folks use that describes a lot of folks use that describes configurations and what they call configurations and what they call configurations and what they call running on with platforms to to define running on with platforms to to define running on with platforms to to define um their CPE structure in a way that's um their CPE structure in a way that's um their CPE structure in a way that's presentable and easily digestible. Um, presentable and easily digestible. Um, presentable and easily digestible. Um, so I have a couple of examples and we so I have a couple of examples and we so I have a couple of examples and we can go back and forth and look at, you can go back and forth and look at, you can go back and forth and look at, you know, what the JSON looks like, how you know, what the JSON looks like, how you know, what the JSON looks like, how you might define it, um, and what NIST NVD might define it, um, and what NIST NVD might define it, um, and what NIST NVD has on their website, um, to help help has on their website, um, to help help has on their website, um, to help help understand how that works and how it how understand how that works and how it how understand how that works and how it how it should be used. Um so anyways uh as it should be used. Um so anyways uh as it should be used. Um so anyways uh as far as terminology configurations on the far as terminology configurations on the far as terminology configurations on the NIST NVD site um this is basically how NIST NVD site um this is basically how NIST NVD site um this is basically how they label um specific sets of products. they label um specific sets of products. they label um specific sets of products. Um in a lot of cases um like in the real Um in a lot of cases um like in the real Um in a lot of cases um like in the real world in practice a lot of the CVE world in practice a lot of the CVE world in practice a lot of the CVE records or or the NVD details will show records or or the NVD details will show records or or the NVD details will show a single configuration with a single a single configuration with a single a single configuration with a single node. It's representing a single product node. It's representing a single product node. It's representing a single product that's affected. um not any kind of that's affected. um not any kind of that's affected. um not any kind of specific platform it needs to run on um specific platform it needs to run on um specific platform it needs to run on um with a maybe a single version or some with a maybe a single version or some with a maybe a single version or some small range of versions that are small range of versions that are small range of versions that are affected. Um so what does that look affected. Um so what does that look affected. Um so what does that look like? Um actually we'll get to that in a like? Um actually we'll get to that in a like? Um actually we'll get to that in a second. second. second. Um part of configurations is nodes and Um part of configurations is nodes and Um part of configurations is nodes and the nodes represent the CPE name or the the nodes represent the CPE name or the the nodes represent the CPE name or the CPE match criteria. Um you can have CPE match criteria. Um you can have CPE match criteria. Um you can have multiple nodes. So for instance, if you multiple nodes. So for instance, if you multiple nodes. So for instance, if you have multiple branches that are affected have multiple branches that are affected have multiple branches that are affected of a particular product, code branches, of a particular product, code branches, of a particular product, code branches, um you can represent those with separate um you can represent those with separate um you can represent those with separate nodes of that uh configuration. Um and nodes of that uh configuration. Um and nodes of that uh configuration. Um and then running on or with is you might be then running on or with is you might be then running on or with is you might be familiar with if you if you looked at familiar with if you if you looked at familiar with if you if you looked at their pages and I'll show you an example their pages and I'll show you an example their pages and I'll show you an example in a second. Um, but basically this is a in a second. Um, but basically this is a in a second. Um, but basically this is a way of say defining like with the way of say defining like with the way of say defining like with the Mozilla example we saw earlier of Mozilla example we saw earlier of Mozilla example we saw earlier of defining a specific product being uh defining a specific product being uh defining a specific product being uh only being vulnerable if it's on a only being vulnerable if it's on a only being vulnerable if it's on a specific platform. So maybe specific OS specific platform. So maybe specific OS specific platform. So maybe specific OS um might be a good way to describe um might be a good way to describe um might be a good way to describe that. that. that. So yeah, that should be big enough. Um, So yeah, that should be big enough. Um, So yeah, that should be big enough. Um, so these are some examples I pulled from so these are some examples I pulled from so these are some examples I pulled from the NVD site that show how they display the NVD site that show how they display the NVD site that show how they display it. Um so there are actually three it. Um so there are actually three it. Um so there are actually three separate examples there. At the very top separate examples there. At the very top separate examples there. At the very top you have just a very simple um fusion you have just a very simple um fusion you have just a very simple um fusion PBX that is vulnerable uh all the way up PBX that is vulnerable uh all the way up PBX that is vulnerable uh all the way up to and including version to and including version to and including version 4.5.7. And what you're actually seeing 4.5.7. And what you're actually seeing 4.5.7. And what you're actually seeing in that CPE that's represented is a CPE in that CPE that's represented is a CPE in that CPE that's represented is a CPE match string. So there's no version match string. So there's no version match string. So there's no version specified in that CPE uh formatted specified in that CPE uh formatted specified in that CPE uh formatted string. So, if you pull down the show string. So, if you pull down the show string. So, if you pull down the show matching CPEs, you'll get all of the matching CPEs, you'll get all of the matching CPEs, you'll get all of the specific CPE identifier names that are specific CPE identifier names that are specific CPE identifier names that are associated with Fusion PBX. Um, and with associated with Fusion PBX. Um, and with associated with Fusion PBX. Um, and with the version specified, you would get the version specified, you would get the version specified, you would get everything from 0 to everything from 0 to everything from 0 to 4.57. Um, so that's a pretty simple 4.57. Um, so that's a pretty simple 4.57. Um, so that's a pretty simple example, though. The the second one down example, though. The the second one down example, though. The the second one down the middle is giving you something that the middle is giving you something that the middle is giving you something that is that is providing a range or I'm is that is providing a range or I'm is that is providing a range or I'm sorry, a version. Um and then a running sorry, a version. Um and then a running sorry, a version. Um and then a running on with platform. So it has to exist on on with platform. So it has to exist on on with platform. So it has to exist on a looks like a Netgear device of some a looks like a Netgear device of some a looks like a Netgear device of some sort. Um so for this particular match sort. Um so for this particular match sort. Um so for this particular match situation, both things would have to situation, both things would have to situation, both things would have to exist. Um and then the last exist. Um and then the last exist. Um and then the last configuration at the bottom showing configuration at the bottom showing configuration at the bottom showing configuration one, NVD does list configuration one, NVD does list configuration one, NVD does list sometimes multiple configurations with sometimes multiple configurations with sometimes multiple configurations with really uh advanced examples. Um this really uh advanced examples. Um this really uh advanced examples. Um this configuration is that is using an and configuration is that is using an and configuration is that is using an and logic um to have three products that all logic um to have three products that all logic um to have three products that all must exist for for a match. must exist for for a match. must exist for for a match. Um so these are some of the basic ways Um so these are some of the basic ways Um so these are some of the basic ways that you can you can see them on the NIS that you can you can see them on the NIS that you can you can see them on the NIS site. But this does translate and the site. But this does translate and the site. But this does translate and the reason I'm showing you this is this reason I'm showing you this is this reason I'm showing you this is this translates to how it would be defined in translates to how it would be defined in translates to how it would be defined in a CDE record and helps you understand a CDE record and helps you understand a CDE record and helps you understand the structure. Um so in the CP uh CVE the structure. Um so in the CP uh CVE the structure. Um so in the CP uh CVE record format we defined a new uh CPE record format we defined a new uh CPE record format we defined a new uh CPE applicability array at the uh within a C applicability array at the uh within a C applicability array at the uh within a C uh CVE record um that is displayed here uh CVE record um that is displayed here uh CVE record um that is displayed here and this is the basic like uh just the and this is the basic like uh just the and this is the basic like uh just the properties that are required for a properties that are required for a properties that are required for a simple record and you can see the simple record and you can see the simple record and you can see the difference between C CP applicanted array. Um so at the very applicanted array. Um so at the very applicanted array. Um so at the very bottom is the way you would define bottom is the way you would define bottom is the way you would define product and version um or that's product and version um or that's product and version um or that's traditionally been provided just text traditionally been provided just text traditionally been provided just text version text product name text vendor. version text product name text vendor. version text product name text vendor. Um above that is a separate new array Um above that is a separate new array Um above that is a separate new array which we've recently defined which is which we've recently defined which is which we've recently defined which is for CPE. So in this case you have your for CPE. So in this case you have your for CPE. So in this case you have your configuration at the top level that configuration at the top level that configuration at the top level that contains nodes which there's only one contains nodes which there's only one contains nodes which there's only one node which contains a CPE match which node which contains a CPE match which node which contains a CPE match which gives you a CPE uh identifier name in gives you a CPE uh identifier name in gives you a CPE uh identifier name in this case which does have the version this case which does have the version this case which does have the version provided. So this would be a single provided. So this would be a single provided. So this would be a single affected version that shows you the affected version that shows you the affected version that shows you the sidebyside of what that would look like sidebyside of what that would look like sidebyside of what that would look like in CPE versus the old way. Um now CPE in CPE versus the old way. Um now CPE in CPE versus the old way. Um now CPE like I said is optional. So you can like I said is optional. So you can like I said is optional. So you can provide this or you don't have to as a provide this or you don't have to as a provide this or you don't have to as a producer of CVE records. That bottom producer of CVE records. That bottom producer of CVE records. That bottom part is the one thing that we do part is the one thing that we do part is the one thing that we do currently uh require in a CVE currently uh require in a CVE currently uh require in a CVE record. So that is the most basic record. So that is the most basic record. So that is the most basic example. Um so again this is the example. Um so again this is the example. Um so again this is the actually this is the same thing. Oh and actually this is the same thing. Oh and actually this is the same thing. Oh and one thing I forgot to mention um there one thing I forgot to mention um there one thing I forgot to mention um there is an operator under nodes um that is an is an operator under nodes um that is an is an operator under nodes um that is an or. I did mention previously that you or. I did mention previously that you or. I did mention previously that you could have more than one CPE match and could have more than one CPE match and could have more than one CPE match and we'll see an example of that. Um the ore we'll see an example of that. Um the ore we'll see an example of that. Um the ore would be used just to as the logic to would be used just to as the logic to would be used just to as the logic to determine how you evaluate those CPE determine how you evaluate those CPE determine how you evaluate those CPE match items. So in this case the ore match items. So in this case the ore match items. So in this case the ore probably isn't used at all but it is a a probably isn't used at all but it is a a probably isn't used at all but it is a a required required required field or property I'm sorry. Um so this field or property I'm sorry. Um so this field or property I'm sorry. Um so this would be like the this example would be would be like the this example would be would be like the this example would be multiple code branches in this case. So multiple code branches in this case. So multiple code branches in this case. So uh the the 1.x branch and the 2.x branch uh the the 1.x branch and the 2.x branch uh the the 1.x branch and the 2.x branch both have affected both have affected both have affected products. Um and this is just another products. Um and this is just another products. Um and this is just another way of describing something similar. way of describing something similar. way of describing something similar. Notice now that the or operator within Notice now that the or operator within Notice now that the or operator within nodes is used to evaluate these two CPE nodes is used to evaluate these two CPE nodes is used to evaluate these two CPE match uh node items. So it could be one match uh node items. So it could be one match uh node items. So it could be one or it could be the other. It doesn't or it could be the other. It doesn't or it could be the other. It doesn't have to be both. So um let's look at a real example and So um let's look at a real example and So um let's look at a real example and this is a a capture of the NVD site. Um this is a a capture of the NVD site. Um this is a a capture of the NVD site. Um so this is showing the uh the NVD so this is showing the uh the NVD so this is showing the uh the NVD configurations for uh affected kernel configurations for uh affected kernel configurations for uh affected kernel versions Linux kernel. Um so you see versions Linux kernel. Um so you see versions Linux kernel. Um so you see multiple branches of the code. Um this multiple branches of the code. Um this multiple branches of the code. Um this is how it's defined is how it's defined is how it's defined for for NIST. And then if you wanted to for for NIST. And then if you wanted to for for NIST. And then if you wanted to define this same set of products within define this same set of products within define this same set of products within the CVE record format, um this is how the CVE record format, um this is how the CVE record format, um this is how you would accomplish the same thing. Now you would accomplish the same thing. Now you would accomplish the same thing. Now notice there is a match criteria ID and notice there is a match criteria ID and notice there is a match criteria ID and this is something that the NVD adds. I this is something that the NVD adds. I this is something that the NVD adds. I pulled this from the the NVD JSON. Uh pulled this from the the NVD JSON. Uh pulled this from the the NVD JSON. Uh otherwise that wouldn't be there. Um the otherwise that wouldn't be there. Um the otherwise that wouldn't be there. Um the match criteria is assigned by uh the NVD match criteria is assigned by uh the NVD match criteria is assigned by uh the NVD and that is not required within a CVE and that is not required within a CVE and that is not required within a CVE record. Um so you can drop that. So in record. Um so you can drop that. So in record. Um so you can drop that. So in this case really the only things that this case really the only things that this case really the only things that are uh that are needed are whether it is are uh that are needed are whether it is are uh that are needed are whether it is vulnerable um the criteria which is the vulnerable um the criteria which is the vulnerable um the criteria which is the CPE name and the version start including CPE name and the version start including CPE name and the version start including and version and excluding in that top and version and excluding in that top and version and excluding in that top CPU match item um and this is all one CPU match item um and this is all one CPU match item um and this is all one configuration with four node items. All right, getting into a little more a All right, getting into a little more a All right, getting into a little more a few more advanced examples. Um, in this few more advanced examples. Um, in this few more advanced examples. Um, in this case, what you're seeing on is the uh is case, what you're seeing on is the uh is case, what you're seeing on is the uh is this the run on run this the run on run this the run on run with? Yeah. Um, so in this case, you're with? Yeah. Um, so in this case, you're with? Yeah. Um, so in this case, you're getting the same two products that we getting the same two products that we getting the same two products that we looked at a moment ago. um but you're looked at a moment ago. um but you're looked at a moment ago. um but you're adding in a second um second set of adding in a second um second set of adding in a second um second set of nodes for defining platforms that they nodes for defining platforms that they nodes for defining platforms that they have to exist on. So in this case it's have to exist on. So in this case it's have to exist on. So in this case it's the same two products from from before. the same two products from from before. the same two products from from before. Either one can exist um and they are Either one can exist um and they are Either one can exist um and they are both affected. They must also exist with both affected. They must also exist with both affected. They must also exist with one of those platforms at the bottom. So one of those platforms at the bottom. So one of those platforms at the bottom. So notice the operator above at the very notice the operator above at the very notice the operator above at the very top under CPA applicability that applies top under CPA applicability that applies top under CPA applicability that applies to both node blocks that follow. Um so to both node blocks that follow. Um so to both node blocks that follow. Um so you have to and those together obviously you have to and those together obviously you have to and those together obviously um it can be either of those products on um it can be either of those products on um it can be either of those products on either of those either of those either of those platforms. platforms. platforms. Um hopefully that makes as much sense to Um hopefully that makes as much sense to Um hopefully that makes as much sense to you guys as it does to me. Now, it takes you guys as it does to me. Now, it takes you guys as it does to me. Now, it takes a little bit of getting used to, but uh a little bit of getting used to, but uh a little bit of getting used to, but uh but it's not too hard but it's not too hard but it's not too hard to to grasp. to to grasp. to to grasp. Um, example four. Uh, what I did here Um, example four. Uh, what I did here Um, example four. Uh, what I did here was an example of multiple was an example of multiple was an example of multiple configurations. Um, and I I'll give you configurations. Um, and I I'll give you configurations. Um, and I I'll give you a a pretty large example of this in a a a pretty large example of this in a a a pretty large example of this in a minute, but essentially what this is minute, but essentially what this is minute, but essentially what this is doing is showing the same same products, doing is showing the same same products, doing is showing the same same products, but they're separated into separate but they're separated into separate but they're separated into separate configurations. The 1.x X branch needs configurations. The 1.x X branch needs configurations. The 1.x X branch needs to exist on Linux kernel 6.7.10 at the to exist on Linux kernel 6.7.10 at the to exist on Linux kernel 6.7.10 at the top and the 2.x needs to exist on the uh top and the 2.x needs to exist on the uh top and the 2.x needs to exist on the uh the brick appliance at the bottom. Um so the brick appliance at the bottom. Um so the brick appliance at the bottom. Um so those are two separate configurations those are two separate configurations those are two separate configurations that are entirely separate from each that are entirely separate from each that are entirely separate from each other. So, um, when I was trying to figure out So, um, when I was trying to figure out So, um, when I was trying to figure out how all this stuff fit together how all this stuff fit together how all this stuff fit together originally, I, uh, I ran into a good originally, I, uh, I ran into a good originally, I, uh, I ran into a good .NET, Microsoft.NET example. Um, and it .NET, Microsoft.NET example. Um, and it .NET, Microsoft.NET example. Um, and it turns out, I think Chris Turner and I turns out, I think Chris Turner and I turns out, I think Chris Turner and I had had a conversation about this at had had a conversation about this at had had a conversation about this at some point from NIST. Um, he also uses some point from NIST. Um, he also uses some point from NIST. Um, he also uses this as an example, but it's this is one this as an example, but it's this is one this as an example, but it's this is one portion of the configurations for this portion of the configurations for this portion of the configurations for this particular CVE. Um, and I didn't put the particular CVE. Um, and I didn't put the particular CVE. Um, and I didn't put the CV name at the top, did I? Um, but I can CV name at the top, did I? Um, but I can CV name at the top, did I? Um, but I can share it with you later. The, uh, this share it with you later. The, uh, this share it with you later. The, uh, this is two of the configuration items. What is two of the configuration items. What is two of the configuration items. What you're seeing is, um, one at the top you're seeing is, um, one at the top you're seeing is, um, one at the top with .NET Framework 2, uh, SP2 and .NET with .NET Framework 2, uh, SP2 and .NET with .NET Framework 2, uh, SP2 and .NET Framework 3 with SP2 and they must be Framework 3 with SP2 and they must be Framework 3 with SP2 and they must be running on Windows Server 2008, SP2, x8, running on Windows Server 2008, SP2, x8, running on Windows Server 2008, SP2, x8, x64, and x86, one of those two. Um and x64, and x86, one of those two. Um and x64, and x86, one of those two. Um and then at the bottom it's a couple of then at the bottom it's a couple of then at the bottom it's a couple of other Microsoft.NET versions um other Microsoft.NET versions um other Microsoft.NET versions um different code branches. Um so what different code branches. Um so what different code branches. Um so what you're seeing is configurations eight you're seeing is configurations eight you're seeing is configurations eight and nine. There were uh seven and nine. There were uh seven and nine. There were uh seven configurations before this. Um so it is configurations before this. Um so it is configurations before this. Um so it is a fairly complex CBE as far as the a fairly complex CBE as far as the a fairly complex CBE as far as the amount of affected products. Um so I had amount of affected products. Um so I had amount of affected products. Um so I had to break this up into two slides but to break this up into two slides but to break this up into two slides but what you can see is that um this is the what you can see is that um this is the what you can see is that um this is the the first this is configuration 8 um the first this is configuration 8 um the first this is configuration 8 um which we saw in the previous example which we saw in the previous example which we saw in the previous example this is pretty similar to one of the this is pretty similar to one of the this is pretty similar to one of the advanced examples um so two different advanced examples um so two different advanced examples um so two different versions of framework at the top and versions of framework at the top and versions of framework at the top and they must be running on one of these OS they must be running on one of these OS they must be running on one of these OS platforms at the platforms at the platforms at the bottom. Um and then configuration nine bottom. Um and then configuration nine bottom. Um and then configuration nine was I think a bit more simple and that was I think a bit more simple and that was I think a bit more simple and that is just a list of match criteria for a is just a list of match criteria for a is just a list of match criteria for a couple of versions of couple of versions of couple of versions of Microsoft.NET Microsoft.NET Microsoft.NET framework. What else do I have? So, framework. What else do I have? So, framework. What else do I have? So, um I know a lot of CNAs we had we um I know a lot of CNAs we had we um I know a lot of CNAs we had we recently had a survey to um see what recently had a survey to um see what recently had a survey to um see what folks are using as far as clients to folks are using as far as clients to folks are using as far as clients to produce data. Um log seem to be fairly produce data. Um log seem to be fairly produce data. Um log seem to be fairly common. Um lo does not currently support common. Um lo does not currently support common. Um lo does not currently support the new structure for CP applicability. the new structure for CP applicability. the new structure for CP applicability. Um but we are uh the developer is Um but we are uh the developer is Um but we are uh the developer is working on something for that. So that working on something for that. So that working on something for that. So that should be something that we'll have should be something that we'll have should be something that we'll have soon. um right now for folks that soon. um right now for folks that soon. um right now for folks that produce produce produce data and they use their own custom tools data and they use their own custom tools data and they use their own custom tools which I think is is fairly common as which I think is is fairly common as which I think is is fairly common as well um they would need to obviously well um they would need to obviously well um they would need to obviously update their own tools. Um, there is a update their own tools. Um, there is a update their own tools. Um, there is a way with the current clients if you want way with the current clients if you want way with the current clients if you want to use volagram to define your records, to use volagram to define your records, to use volagram to define your records, you can use one of the other clients to you can use one of the other clients to you can use one of the other clients to add the CPE information later as an add the CPE information later as an add the CPE information later as an update. Um, and that you could use CBE update. Um, and that you could use CBE update. Um, and that you could use CBE client or CBE lib for client or CBE lib for client or CBE lib for that to add it that to add it that to add it after. And I threw some references in after. And I threw some references in after. And I threw some references in here. Um, so if you guys do end up using here. Um, so if you guys do end up using here. Um, so if you guys do end up using the slide deck later, um, you can get to the slide deck later, um, you can get to the slide deck later, um, you can get to our quick start guide, which I wrote the our quick start guide, which I wrote the our quick start guide, which I wrote the CVE, CVE, CVE, uh, or using CPE and CV records quick uh, or using CPE and CV records quick uh, or using CPE and CV records quick start guide that we have on the CVE.org start guide that we have on the CVE.org start guide that we have on the CVE.org website. Um, and then the couple of NIST website. Um, and then the couple of NIST website. Um, and then the couple of NIST references that I pulled some of these references that I pulled some of these references that I pulled some of these graphics from. Um, as well as the the graphics from. Um, as well as the the graphics from. Um, as well as the the CPE specifications themselves are linked CPE specifications themselves are linked CPE specifications themselves are linked here. And with here. And with here. And with that, I think we have seven minutes for that, I think we have seven minutes for that, I think we have seven minutes for questions. Oh, does that mic work? Oh, does that mic work? Oh, does that mic work? Yeah, I switched out batteries. Okay, thank you for the presentation. Um are thank you for the presentation. Um are thank you for the presentation. Um are you planning or is CVE planning to um I you planning or is CVE planning to um I you planning or is CVE planning to um I guess make the CPE's array obsolete then guess make the CPE's array obsolete then guess make the CPE's array obsolete then if we introduce CPE applicability if we introduce CPE applicability if we introduce CPE applicability because now and yeah uh I I ran into the because now and yeah uh I I ran into the because now and yeah uh I I ran into the issue with vulneroggram where I couldn't issue with vulneroggram where I couldn't issue with vulneroggram where I couldn't actually use CPE applicability um and I actually use CPE applicability um and I actually use CPE applicability um and I didn't know it's because it wasn't didn't know it's because it wasn't didn't know it's because it wasn't supported. I just realized I just supported. I just realized I just supported. I just realized I just stripped it when I um Yeah. So you put stripped it when I um Yeah. So you put stripped it when I um Yeah. So you put it into the source tag. Yes. Exactly. it into the source tag. Yes. Exactly. it into the source tag. Yes. Exactly. And what we normally do is we add the And what we normally do is we add the And what we normally do is we add the CPEs like we list them out in the CPEs CPEs like we list them out in the CPEs CPEs like we list them out in the CPEs array under the affected section. So array under the affected section. So array under the affected section. So will you be keeping or do you know if will you be keeping or do you know if will you be keeping or do you know if they will still keep that field or is they will still keep that field or is they will still keep that field or is the plan to remove that completely now the plan to remove that completely now the plan to remove that completely now that CP applicability is there? That's a that CP applicability is there? That's a that CP applicability is there? That's a great question and I forgot to to great question and I forgot to to great question and I forgot to to mention that. So we did have support for mention that. So we did have support for mention that. So we did have support for listing CPEs in the affected array. Um listing CPEs in the affected array. Um listing CPEs in the affected array. Um the problem was that that we ran into the problem was that that we ran into the problem was that that we ran into with that was that you couldn't define with that was that you couldn't define with that was that you couldn't define CPEs in such a way for it to make sense CPEs in such a way for it to make sense CPEs in such a way for it to make sense within the the affected array. Um there within the the affected array. Um there within the the affected array. Um there was no way to say it's all like if you was no way to say it's all like if you was no way to say it's all like if you list the CPE names, somebody trying to list the CPE names, somebody trying to list the CPE names, somebody trying to interpret that may not understand that interpret that may not understand that interpret that may not understand that it's a CPE identifier name or a match it's a CPE identifier name or a match it's a CPE identifier name or a match string. if whether you and and or all string. if whether you and and or all string. if whether you and and or all those things together, whether those are those things together, whether those are those things together, whether those are affected CPEs or whether they're fixed affected CPEs or whether they're fixed affected CPEs or whether they're fixed CPEs, there's so many ways that that CPE CPEs, there's so many ways that that CPE CPEs, there's so many ways that that CPE array could be interpreted um that it array could be interpreted um that it array could be interpreted um that it didn't make a lot of sense. So, we added didn't make a lot of sense. So, we added didn't make a lot of sense. So, we added the applicability language because you the applicability language because you the applicability language because you can specifically state what's affected, can specifically state what's affected, can specifically state what's affected, what's not, you can make those what's not, you can make those what's not, you can make those representations between multiple CPEs. representations between multiple CPEs. representations between multiple CPEs. Um the array itself that you're Um the array itself that you're Um the array itself that you're referring to, the older array will stay referring to, the older array will stay referring to, the older array will stay for now. we didn't take that away um for now. we didn't take that away um for now. we didn't take that away um because there's a lot of data that because there's a lot of data that because there's a lot of data that exists in that right now. Um so we don't exists in that right now. Um so we don't exists in that right now. Um so we don't have any plans to remove that anytime have any plans to remove that anytime have any plans to remove that anytime soon, but we'll definitely let the soon, but we'll definitely let the soon, but we'll definitely let the community know if we make any decisions community know if we make any decisions community know if we make any decisions or that would change that. So does that or that would change that. So does that or that would change that. So does that help? Hi, great session. Hi, great session. Hi, great session. Um so what is the Um so what is the Um so what is the um so um so um so CVE uh is now creating their own CV CP CVE uh is now creating their own CV CP CVE uh is now creating their own CV CP um tracking or and how does that affect um tracking or and how does that affect um tracking or and how does that affect the NVD or is it a copy of it? You mean the NVD or is it a copy of it? You mean the NVD or is it a copy of it? You mean like a dictionary? Um so we haven't like a dictionary? Um so we haven't like a dictionary? Um so we haven't we're definitely not keeping a we're definitely not keeping a we're definitely not keeping a dictionary. Um these are just CPEs that dictionary. Um these are just CPEs that dictionary. Um these are just CPEs that CNAs and data producers can provide um CNAs and data producers can provide um CNAs and data producers can provide um like an optional field as an optional like an optional field as an optional like an optional field as an optional field. So but what happens then because field. So but what happens then because field. So but what happens then because then it will be published into the NVD. then it will be published into the NVD. then it will be published into the NVD. We hope and we've already had some We hope and we've already had some We hope and we've already had some conversation conversations with the NVD conversation conversations with the NVD conversation conversations with the NVD team that maybe down the road we can team that maybe down the road we can team that maybe down the road we can start sharing data and pushing some of start sharing data and pushing some of start sharing data and pushing some of that potentially into the NVD official that potentially into the NVD official that potentially into the NVD official CPE dictionary. But that's that's CPE dictionary. But that's that's CPE dictionary. But that's that's something we still need to work on. But something we still need to work on. But something we still need to work on. But for the CV.org, it's the CNA delivering for the CV.org, it's the CNA delivering for the CV.org, it's the CNA delivering an optional information CP where the NVD an optional information CP where the NVD an optional information CP where the NVD is, you know, requiring input from is, you know, requiring input from is, you know, requiring input from users. users. users. Sorry. Sorry, say it again. I missed. So Sorry. Sorry, say it again. I missed. So Sorry. Sorry, say it again. I missed. So the so the CV.org is um asking the CNAs the so the CV.org is um asking the CNAs the so the CV.org is um asking the CNAs to you know optionally fill out the uh to you know optionally fill out the uh to you know optionally fill out the uh the CPE data. Yes, we would like CNAs to the CPE data. Yes, we would like CNAs to the CPE data. Yes, we would like CNAs to enrich the data with this because we enrich the data with this because we enrich the data with this because we know that there's a need for data know that there's a need for data know that there's a need for data consumers to have CP information in some consumers to have CP information in some consumers to have CP information in some cases. And then and then yeah, and then cases. And then and then yeah, and then cases. And then and then yeah, and then the NVD will the NVD will the NVD will um they do it on request adding CP um they do it on request adding CP um they do it on request adding CP information if if there's CP information information if if there's CP information information if if there's CP information missing. So wouldn't it be better to missing. So wouldn't it be better to missing. So wouldn't it be better to somehow work Yeah. closer together? And somehow work Yeah. closer together? And somehow work Yeah. closer together? And I I think we are it's just not uh I I think we are it's just not uh I I think we are it's just not uh apparent. So we have the equality apparent. So we have the equality apparent. So we have the equality working group and the automation work working group and the automation work working group and the automation work group working CPE. Okay. We have a group working CPE. Okay. We have a group working CPE. Okay. We have a member of MBD who is actually on the member of MBD who is actually on the member of MBD who is actually on the board for board for board for CE. Okay. We spoke with with Tanya and CE. Okay. We spoke with with Tanya and CE. Okay. We spoke with with Tanya and and with Chris about that. So they're in and with Chris about that. So they're in and with Chris about that. So they're in charge of that. They're going to and charge of that. They're going to and charge of that. They're going to and they're reviewing what we're putting they're reviewing what we're putting they're reviewing what we're putting together. What we're trying to do is together. What we're trying to do is together. What we're trying to do is extend that. MVD uh had their work plan. extend that. MVD uh had their work plan. extend that. MVD uh had their work plan. we we asked if we could help advance we we asked if we could help advance we we asked if we could help advance that work plan. So, they're accepting that work plan. So, they're accepting that work plan. So, they're accepting it, but they want to have a review as we it, but they want to have a review as we it, but they want to have a review as we go through our work. We're trying to do go through our work. We're trying to do go through our work. We're trying to do that in stages and steps. And if we can that in stages and steps. And if we can that in stages and steps. And if we can do that, what we're trying to do is do that, what we're trying to do is do that, what we're trying to do is extend that CPE extend that CPE extend that CPE uh dictionary to include how we do some uh dictionary to include how we do some uh dictionary to include how we do some things. There's some pre-work that was things. There's some pre-work that was things. There's some pre-work that was done by Google and Microsoft with MVD done by Google and Microsoft with MVD done by Google and Microsoft with MVD that I think actually paved the way for that I think actually paved the way for that I think actually paved the way for that to work. And and Tanya can correct that to work. And and Tanya can correct that to work. And and Tanya can correct me if I got it wrong. Okay. But we're me if I got it wrong. Okay. But we're me if I got it wrong. Okay. But we're also looking then how do we add curl to also looking then how do we add curl to also looking then how do we add curl to that entire problem set because for that entire problem set because for that entire problem set because for especially those in open source the CPE especially those in open source the CPE especially those in open source the CPE is not very adaptable in some ways. is not very adaptable in some ways. is not very adaptable in some ways. Trying to be nice here. I just went Trying to be nice here. I just went Trying to be nice here. I just went through the other session. So we're through the other session. So we're through the other session. So we're we're trying to actually do that from a we're trying to actually do that from a we're trying to actually do that from a CVE as a problem set that we have CVE as a problem set that we have CVE as a problem set that we have because we want the CNA to actually because we want the CNA to actually because we want the CNA to actually enrich that and there has to be a an enrich that and there has to be a an enrich that and there has to be a an expansion of that and and it's just that expansion of that and and it's just that expansion of that and and it's just that you know the dictionary has been updated you know the dictionary has been updated you know the dictionary has been updated for a while was not a work plan and for a while was not a work plan and for a while was not a work plan and we're all running into that problem set we're all running into that problem set we're all running into that problem set now both open and closed source or open now both open and closed source or open now both open and closed source or open and proprietary however you want to word and proprietary however you want to word and proprietary however you want to word that uh that we need that expansion that uh that we need that expansion that uh that we need that expansion otherwise Google and Microsoft wouldn't otherwise Google and Microsoft wouldn't otherwise Google and Microsoft wouldn't have been asking ready and and you know have been asking ready and and you know have been asking ready and and you know that's pretty big. Uh certainly not the that's pretty big. Uh certainly not the that's pretty big. Uh certainly not the universe, but it goes to the extent of universe, but it goes to the extent of universe, but it goes to the extent of the problem that we're all trying to the problem that we're all trying to the problem that we're all trying to work through and and do in a way where work through and and do in a way where work through and and do in a way where we don't kill each other and run each we don't kill each other and run each we don't kill each other and run each other over. So I I found the MVD uh other over. So I I found the MVD uh other over. So I I found the MVD uh willing, you know, uh I don't think willing, you know, uh I don't think willing, you know, uh I don't think they're unwilling. It's just a matter of they're unwilling. It's just a matter of they're unwilling. It's just a matter of how do we make it work and and that's how do we make it work and and that's how do we make it work and and that's what Chris and and the AWG and QWG are what Chris and and the AWG and QWG are what Chris and and the AWG and QWG are trying to work through. So then the trying to work through. So then the trying to work through. So then the final question is how do we keep track final question is how do we keep track final question is how do we keep track of the quality of the quality of the quality data is because if a CNA can just data is because if a CNA can just data is because if a CNA can just publish it but who's checking if it's publish it but who's checking if it's publish it but who's checking if it's actually actually actually there's a well that there's a couple there's a well that there's a couple there's a well that there's a couple depends in there. The first thing we're depends in there. The first thing we're depends in there. The first thing we're doing is we're trying to collect the CPE doing is we're trying to collect the CPE doing is we're trying to collect the CPE data but we're not doing the recognition data but we're not doing the recognition data but we're not doing the recognition against the CPE against the CPE against the CPE because we're trying to get to what is because we're trying to get to what is because we're trying to get to what is that quality part. Um so that's why we that quality part. Um so that's why we that quality part. Um so that's why we haven't pushed in that realm yet because haven't pushed in that realm yet because haven't pushed in that realm yet because Where's the definition of that? Where's the definition of that? Where's the definition of that? Yep. I think we just got told we're Yep. I think we just got told we're Yep. I think we just got told we're we're done. But thank you guys. We'll uh we're done. But thank you guys. We'll uh we're done. But thank you guys. We'll uh we may be able to take some of this up we may be able to take some of this up we may be able to take some of this up in the next the next talk as well.
