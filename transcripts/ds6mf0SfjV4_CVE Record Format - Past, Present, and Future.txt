Kind: captions Language: en Hey y'all. Um, welcome. I am Chris Hey y'all. Um, welcome. I am Chris Hey y'all. Um, welcome. I am Chris Coffin. Um, I'm from the MITER Coffin. Um, I'm from the MITER Coffin. Um, I'm from the MITER Corporation. Um, I had another talk Corporation. Um, I had another talk Corporation. Um, I had another talk earlier, but I'll explain it again. I earlier, but I'll explain it again. I earlier, but I'll explain it again. I I've been with MITER since 2012. Um, and I've been with MITER since 2012. Um, and I've been with MITER since 2012. Um, and most of that time I've spent on the CVE most of that time I've spent on the CVE most of that time I've spent on the CVE program, but various other things. Um, program, but various other things. Um, program, but various other things. Um, so, um, I'm also a CVE board member. Um, so, um, I'm also a CVE board member. Um, so, um, I'm also a CVE board member. Um, and also co-chair of the CVE quality and also co-chair of the CVE quality and also co-chair of the CVE quality working group. But I know there's been a working group. But I know there's been a working group. But I know there's been a lot of talk about the CVE record format. lot of talk about the CVE record format. lot of talk about the CVE record format. So this is where we're going to cover So this is where we're going to cover So this is where we're going to cover some of that. Um current efforts though some of that. Um current efforts though some of that. Um current efforts though I I really do um I most of my time now I I really do um I most of my time now I I really do um I most of my time now is spent driving uh the CVE record is spent driving uh the CVE record is spent driving uh the CVE record format on the quality working group and format on the quality working group and format on the quality working group and that's what I really want to focus on. that's what I really want to focus on. that's what I really want to focus on. Um and yeah, that's that's me. And I'm Um and yeah, that's that's me. And I'm Um and yeah, that's that's me. And I'm also joined by MZ. also joined by MZ. also joined by MZ. Hello. Um forgive me for sitting. I Hello. Um forgive me for sitting. I Hello. Um forgive me for sitting. I rolled my ankle earlier this week and rolled my ankle earlier this week and rolled my ankle earlier this week and standing kind of sucks. standing kind of sucks. standing kind of sucks. the I am also a co-chair of the quality the I am also a co-chair of the quality the I am also a co-chair of the quality working group uh NC board member uh I'm working group uh NC board member uh I'm working group uh NC board member uh I'm a day principal security engineer for F5 a day principal security engineer for F5 a day principal security engineer for F5 uh but we're here to talk about CV records excuse us for our handoffs too records excuse us for our handoffs too records excuse us for our handoffs too we didn't pre-plan um so overview of we didn't pre-plan um so overview of we didn't pre-plan um so overview of what we want to cover um so we've got what we want to cover um so we've got what we want to cover um so we've got obviously we want to cover what what is obviously we want to cover what what is obviously we want to cover what what is the record format for those of you that the record format for those of you that the record format for those of you that might not be familiar might not be familiar might not be familiar um what have we recently recently um what have we recently recently um what have we recently recently released as far as uh features and released as far as uh features and released as far as uh features and updates? Um what we've already put into updates? Um what we've already put into updates? Um what we've already put into our GitHub repo, which we'll touch on in our GitHub repo, which we'll touch on in our GitHub repo, which we'll touch on in a little bit. Um what we're working on a little bit. Um what we're working on a little bit. Um what we're working on currently. Um some of the things that currently. Um some of the things that currently. Um some of the things that might be on the horizon for the format. might be on the horizon for the format. might be on the horizon for the format. Um and then um I did throw something in Um and then um I did throw something in Um and then um I did throw something in about identifying properties for about identifying properties for about identifying properties for removal. Um which is a hot topic that we removal. Um which is a hot topic that we removal. Um which is a hot topic that we haven't discussed a whole lot yet, but haven't discussed a whole lot yet, but haven't discussed a whole lot yet, but we uh we're getting there. So let's and we uh we're getting there. So let's and we uh we're getting there. So let's and if we have time for questions, we'll do if we have time for questions, we'll do if we have time for questions, we'll do that. Um so what is the CVE record that. Um so what is the CVE record that. Um so what is the CVE record format for those that that need an format for those that that need an format for those that that need an update? Um it is the blueprint. Um it is update? Um it is the blueprint. Um it is update? Um it is the blueprint. Um it is the JSON schema that we use for the JSON schema that we use for the JSON schema that we use for ingesting records as well as displaying ingesting records as well as displaying ingesting records as well as displaying records. Um so when CNAs submit CVE records. Um so when CNAs submit CVE records. Um so when CNAs submit CVE records to the CVE program, um those go records to the CVE program, um those go records to the CVE program, um those go through the JSON format. Um, and it through the JSON format. Um, and it through the JSON format. Um, and it helps define what should be in those helps define what should be in those helps define what should be in those records and what the requirements are. records and what the requirements are. records and what the requirements are. So, I know some of you might have been So, I know some of you might have been So, I know some of you might have been in some other talks and have heard about in some other talks and have heard about in some other talks and have heard about this. We'll we'll talk a little more this. We'll we'll talk a little more this. We'll we'll talk a little more about that. Um, current version of the about that. Um, current version of the about that. Um, current version of the format is format is format is 5.1.1. Um, oh, you have a mic, too. Yep. 5.1.1. Um, oh, you have a mic, too. Yep. 5.1.1. Um, oh, you have a mic, too. Yep. I believe so. Is this working? Yeah, I believe so. Is this working? Yeah, I believe so. Is this working? Yeah, there we go. there we go. there we go. Yeah. So, 511 today we're working on I Yeah. So, 511 today we're working on I Yeah. So, 511 today we're working on I think what's going to be think what's going to be think what's going to be 512. Talk about that. Yep. 512. Talk about that. Yep. 512. Talk about that. Yep. Um, so taking a step back, why should Um, so taking a step back, why should Um, so taking a step back, why should you care about the CVE record format? you care about the CVE record format? you care about the CVE record format? Um, it does, like I said, determine what Um, it does, like I said, determine what Um, it does, like I said, determine what data is provided by CNAs. Um, think data is provided by CNAs. Um, think data is provided by CNAs. Um, think affected products and versions. Think affected products and versions. Think affected products and versions. Think CVSS, CPE, all that stuff. Um, and and CVSS, CPE, all that stuff. Um, and and CVSS, CPE, all that stuff. Um, and and future formats as well. Um, it also future formats as well. Um, it also future formats as well. Um, it also determines what the minimum requirements determines what the minimum requirements determines what the minimum requirements are for submissions and that is a hot are for submissions and that is a hot are for submissions and that is a hot topic. Yeah, there were some talk topic. Yeah, there were some talk topic. Yeah, there were some talk conversations earlier this week, some conversations earlier this week, some conversations earlier this week, some presentations earlier this week on that presentations earlier this week on that presentations earlier this week on that topic. Um, the minimum requirements are topic. Um, the minimum requirements are topic. Um, the minimum requirements are pretty much the minimum requirements. pretty much the minimum requirements. pretty much the minimum requirements. Uh, why not? Are you coming through the Uh, why not? Are you coming through the Uh, why not? Are you coming through the speakers? Just have to talk closer. I speakers? Just have to talk closer. I speakers? Just have to talk closer. I have to talk I had to hold it really have to talk I had to hold it really have to talk I had to hold it really close to my mouth. Okay. Um, different close to my mouth. Okay. Um, different close to my mouth. Okay. Um, different mics, different sessions. Uh, so uh mics, different sessions. Uh, so uh mics, different sessions. Uh, so uh yeah, what was I saying? the minimum yeah, what was I saying? the minimum yeah, what was I saying? the minimum requirements are very much the minimum requirements are very much the minimum requirements are very much the minimum requirements right now and there are requirements right now and there are requirements right now and there are some certainly some ongoing debates some certainly some ongoing debates some certainly some ongoing debates about do what should be additionally about do what should be additionally about do what should be additionally required if anything and and all that required if anything and and all that required if anything and and all that kind of thing right now it's pretty kind of thing right now it's pretty kind of thing right now it's pretty minimal to have a record yeah if any of minimal to have a record yeah if any of minimal to have a record yeah if any of you caught Pollock's talk I told him I you caught Pollock's talk I told him I you caught Pollock's talk I told him I was going to call him out um on was going to call him out um on was going to call him out um on comparing CVE and OSV um I've had comparing CVE and OSV um I've had comparing CVE and OSV um I've had multiple conversations with Andrew in multiple conversations with Andrew in multiple conversations with Andrew in the past and also yesterday before and the past and also yesterday before and the past and also yesterday before and after his after his after his Um I'm very open to his feedback as well Um I'm very open to his feedback as well Um I'm very open to his feedback as well as anyone in this room that wants to as anyone in this room that wants to as anyone in this room that wants to provide feedback. Um we are all about provide feedback. Um we are all about provide feedback. Um we are all about communicating and helping drive things communicating and helping drive things communicating and helping drive things forward and we want to do that as fast forward and we want to do that as fast forward and we want to do that as fast as possible. Um there's a big focus now as possible. Um there's a big focus now as possible. Um there's a big focus now um at um at um at least until recently we spent a lot of least until recently we spent a lot of least until recently we spent a lot of time working with CNAs trying to help time working with CNAs trying to help time working with CNAs trying to help them define better data. I think what we them define better data. I think what we them define better data. I think what we really need to do instead and what we really need to do instead and what we really need to do instead and what we want to do going forward is focus on the want to do going forward is focus on the want to do going forward is focus on the consumers. Um, and there are some consumers. Um, and there are some consumers. Um, and there are some efforts to do that already in place. But efforts to do that already in place. But efforts to do that already in place. But I think where we will start is with I I I think where we will start is with I I I think where we will start is with I I think we're talking about standing up a think we're talking about standing up a think we're talking about standing up a consumer working group. Um, so anyone in consumer working group. Um, so anyone in consumer working group. Um, so anyone in this room that is a consumer of CVE this room that is a consumer of CVE this room that is a consumer of CVE data, we want your feedback. Um, if you data, we want your feedback. Um, if you data, we want your feedback. Um, if you are available to participate in a are available to participate in a are available to participate in a working group, we'd love to hear that as working group, we'd love to hear that as working group, we'd love to hear that as well because that's something we're well because that's something we're well because that's something we're thinking about standing up. Yeah, I said thinking about standing up. Yeah, I said thinking about standing up. Yeah, I said that as a board member. I brought it up. that as a board member. I brought it up. that as a board member. I brought it up. I I very much strongly believe we have a I I very much strongly believe we have a I I very much strongly believe we have a lot of input from the supply side right lot of input from the supply side right lot of input from the supply side right now. There's a lot of input from the now. There's a lot of input from the now. There's a lot of input from the CNAs. Uh but it's just kind of like we CNAs. Uh but it's just kind of like we CNAs. Uh but it's just kind of like we publish things and expect consumers to publish things and expect consumers to publish things and expect consumers to just consume. Uh I do think we really just consume. Uh I do think we really just consume. Uh I do think we really need to get more feedback uh organized need to get more feedback uh organized need to get more feedback uh organized feedback from the consumer side so that feedback from the consumer side so that feedback from the consumer side so that it helps shape the program because we it helps shape the program because we it helps shape the program because we need to serve both our consumer audience need to serve both our consumer audience need to serve both our consumer audience and the supply audience. I think we it's and the supply audience. I think we it's and the supply audience. I think we it's been a little imbalanced. my my view. been a little imbalanced. my my view. been a little imbalanced. my my view. That's That's That's right. Um, okay. So, a little bit about right. Um, okay. So, a little bit about right. Um, okay. So, a little bit about what we've done in the recent past. Um, what we've done in the recent past. Um, what we've done in the recent past. Um, May of 2024, we uh implemented the 5.1.0 May of 2024, we uh implemented the 5.1.0 May of 2024, we uh implemented the 5.1.0 version of the CVE record format. Um, version of the CVE record format. Um, version of the CVE record format. Um, the big change with that was adding the big change with that was adding the big change with that was adding CVSS4. Um, so I don't have stats on how CVSS4. Um, so I don't have stats on how CVSS4. Um, so I don't have stats on how many people are using it yet, but I know many people are using it yet, but I know many people are using it yet, but I know it was we are I know like the Microsoft it was we are I know like the Microsoft it was we are I know like the Microsoft Red Hat with some others who are using Red Hat with some others who are using Red Hat with some others who are using some a lot of the big CNAs started to some a lot of the big CNAs started to some a lot of the big CNAs started to use CPSS4. There were some pent-up use CPSS4. There were some pent-up use CPSS4. There were some pent-up demand. Um, uh, and also I think the demand. Um, uh, and also I think the demand. Um, uh, and also I think the other thing that was really done in other thing that was really done in other thing that was really done in there was what's popping on a slide is there was what's popping on a slide is there was what's popping on a slide is the name change tighten tightening up the name change tighten tightening up the name change tighten tightening up some of the validations and things that some of the validations and things that some of the validations and things that we did. We also did the name change. Oh, we did. We also did the name change. Oh, we did. We also did the name change. Oh, the name change. Yeah. Yeah. So it was the name change. Yeah. Yeah. So it was the name change. Yeah. Yeah. So it was JSON CVEJ JSON five I think we're JSON CVEJ JSON five I think we're JSON CVEJ JSON five I think we're referring to it as and we moved to the referring to it as and we moved to the referring to it as and we moved to the CVE record CVE record CVE record format. Um and yeah there was some format. Um and yeah there was some format. Um and yeah there was some various tightening up of different parts various tightening up of different parts various tightening up of different parts of the schema for you know I think we're of the schema for you know I think we're of the schema for you know I think we're we're still there's a a new one that we're still there's a a new one that we're still there's a a new one that actually we'll cover in just a second. actually we'll cover in just a second. actually we'll cover in just a second. Um CV record format 5.1.1 was released Um CV record format 5.1.1 was released Um CV record format 5.1.1 was released in December of last year. Um, and the in December of last year. Um, and the in December of last year. Um, and the big uh addition with that was the big uh addition with that was the big uh addition with that was the ability to add CPE data in a more robust ability to add CPE data in a more robust ability to add CPE data in a more robust way. Um, I know it's not represented on way. Um, I know it's not represented on way. Um, I know it's not represented on the slide. We did allow CPE prior to the slide. We did allow CPE prior to the slide. We did allow CPE prior to that. Um, but it it wasn't very usable. that. Um, but it it wasn't very usable. that. Um, but it it wasn't very usable. You want to talk about your experiences You want to talk about your experiences You want to talk about your experiences with that? Yeah, sure. I was one of the with that? Yeah, sure. I was one of the with that? Yeah, sure. I was one of the the agitators for for this change. the agitators for for this change. the agitators for for this change. Um, previous versions of CVSS uh record Um, previous versions of CVSS uh record Um, previous versions of CVSS uh record format. you want to say schema, but format. you want to say schema, but format. you want to say schema, but series record format allowed for CP, but series record format allowed for CP, but series record format allowed for CP, but it was basically just an array. There's it was basically just an array. There's it was basically just an array. There's like a CPE array and you could put like a CPE array and you could put like a CPE array and you could put arrays of values in, but there was arrays of values in, but there was arrays of values in, but there was nothing to indicate what those values nothing to indicate what those values nothing to indicate what those values actually meant. And what we were seeing actually meant. And what we were seeing actually meant. And what we were seeing was there were some there were a few was there were some there were a few was there were some there were a few different CIAs using that array, but different CIAs using that array, but different CIAs using that array, but some were putting in their fixed CPEs, some were putting in their fixed CPEs, some were putting in their fixed CPEs, others were putting in the vulnerable others were putting in the vulnerable others were putting in the vulnerable CPEs. And it was which basically meant CPEs. And it was which basically meant CPEs. And it was which basically meant the data downstream was useless because the data downstream was useless because the data downstream was useless because you had no idea of knowing when you were you had no idea of knowing when you were you had no idea of knowing when you were consuming it. Okay, here's a CPE in a consuming it. Okay, here's a CPE in a consuming it. Okay, here's a CPE in a vacuum just floating around. at the CPE vacuum just floating around. at the CPE vacuum just floating around. at the CPE does what does this map to affect does what does this map to affect does what does this map to affect affected whatever. So we went through a affected whatever. So we went through a affected whatever. So we went through a lot of discussion and basically came lot of discussion and basically came lot of discussion and basically came back around to eventually adopting the back around to eventually adopting the back around to eventually adopting the same format with small naming changes same format with small naming changes same format with small naming changes that NVD has been using for a long time. that NVD has been using for a long time. that NVD has been using for a long time. the the applicability statement that the the applicability statement that the the applicability statement that format uh partially there was lots there format uh partially there was lots there format uh partially there was lots there were there were several different were there were several different were there were several different proposals that that went in that were proposals that that went in that were proposals that that went in that were floated about doing this but that one floated about doing this but that one floated about doing this but that one went out partially because of weight went out partially because of weight went out partially because of weight about there was already a lot of use of about there was already a lot of use of about there was already a lot of use of that format out there compatibility that format out there compatibility that format out there compatibility where if somebody wanted to bring their where if somebody wanted to bring their where if somebody wanted to bring their data across that was already in the data across that was already in the data across that was already in the record from NVD you could just port it record from NVD you could just port it record from NVD you could just port it across there lots of advantages to it across there lots of advantages to it across there lots of advantages to it but it provided all the flexibility you but it provided all the flexibility you but it provided all the flexibility you needed of defining a CPE and and ranges needed of defining a CPE and and ranges needed of defining a CPE and and ranges and things exactly the same way NVD and things exactly the same way NVD and things exactly the same way NVD records have been doing it. Uh so now records have been doing it. Uh so now records have been doing it. Uh so now we've seen like Microsoft, Red Hat and I we've seen like Microsoft, Red Hat and I we've seen like Microsoft, Red Hat and I think some others now but I know think some others now but I know think some others now but I know Microsoft Microsoft was kind of our Microsoft Microsoft was kind of our Microsoft Microsoft was kind of our flagship adopter of that. Y we worked flagship adopter of that. Y we worked flagship adopter of that. Y we worked with Lisa Olsson over there. There were with Lisa Olsson over there. There were with Lisa Olsson over there. There were a few for all starts like we we all a few for all starts like we we all a few for all starts like we we all learning processes we were definitely learning processes we were definitely learning processes we were definitely documentation that goes with that. documentation that goes with that. documentation that goes with that. There's now documentation for using There's now documentation for using There's now documentation for using those fields. A lot of that was done those fields. A lot of that was done those fields. A lot of that was done with experience of working kind of you with experience of working kind of you with experience of working kind of you know feedback loops with Lisa on getting know feedback loops with Lisa on getting know feedback loops with Lisa on getting that nailed down. Red Hat started using that nailed down. Red Hat started using that nailed down. Red Hat started using it as putting on my CNA hat is working it as putting on my CNA hat is working it as putting on my CNA hat is working on doing that. I need to get some on doing that. I need to get some on doing that. I need to get some tooling finalized to start publishing tooling finalized to start publishing tooling finalized to start publishing those. Uh but it's very usable now. those. Uh but it's very usable now. those. Uh but it's very usable now. That's right. Yeah. And for those he That's right. Yeah. And for those he That's right. Yeah. And for those he mentioned uh some documentation. There mentioned uh some documentation. There mentioned uh some documentation. There is a using CPE and CVE quick start guide is a using CPE and CVE quick start guide is a using CPE and CVE quick start guide on the cve.org resources page. Um and I on the cve.org resources page. Um and I on the cve.org resources page. Um and I can give you guys a link to that. I can give you guys a link to that. I can give you guys a link to that. I think not sure if I include it in the think not sure if I include it in the think not sure if I include it in the slide deck, but I'll make sure. Um, so slide deck, but I'll make sure. Um, so slide deck, but I'll make sure. Um, so outside of CPE, the other things that we outside of CPE, the other things that we outside of CPE, the other things that we uh that we added was just a simple uh that we added was just a simple uh that we added was just a simple miscellaneous update. I think I um I miscellaneous update. I think I um I miscellaneous update. I think I um I modified our example CVE records. Um, I modified our example CVE records. Um, I modified our example CVE records. Um, I don't know if we've documented this don't know if we've documented this don't know if we've documented this well, but the uh it's pretty common for well, but the uh it's pretty common for well, but the uh it's pretty common for folks to use CVEes as with examples in folks to use CVEes as with examples in folks to use CVEes as with examples in the wild. Um, and we'd really like to the wild. Um, and we'd really like to the wild. Um, and we'd really like to push folks to use a namespace that push folks to use a namespace that push folks to use a namespace that doesn't really that isn't clash with a doesn't really that isn't clash with a doesn't really that isn't clash with a real nameace. Yeah. So, starting to use real nameace. Yeah. So, starting to use real nameace. Yeah. So, starting to use the CVE 1900 the CVE 1900 the CVE 1900 um um um unless like unless you have like a buggy unless like unless you have like a buggy unless like unless you have like a buggy whip problem, you don't really need whip problem, you don't really need whip problem, you don't really need 1900. 1900. 1900. Yep. So, minor change. Um, so we Yep. So, minor change. Um, so we Yep. So, minor change. Um, so we mentioned CP applicability statements in mentioned CP applicability statements in mentioned CP applicability statements in 5.1.1. Um it is essentially a copy not 5.1.1. Um it is essentially a copy not 5.1.1. Um it is essentially a copy not well I shouldn't say copy but mirror of well I shouldn't say copy but mirror of well I shouldn't say copy but mirror of what the NVD vulnerability details does what the NVD vulnerability details does what the NVD vulnerability details does for for for configurations. Um there is a name configurations. Um there is a name configurations. Um there is a name change at the top we call it CP change at the top we call it CP change at the top we call it CP applicability instead of configurations. applicability instead of configurations. applicability instead of configurations. Um but essentially what that means is is Um but essentially what that means is is Um but essentially what that means is is you could take your data from the NVD you could take your data from the NVD you could take your data from the NVD vulnerability details and copy the JSON vulnerability details and copy the JSON vulnerability details and copy the JSON into the CV record. into the CV record. into the CV record. Um, we don't require the match criteria Um, we don't require the match criteria Um, we don't require the match criteria ID because that is assigned by NIST, but ID because that is assigned by NIST, but ID because that is assigned by NIST, but it is it we don't require it, but it's it is it we don't require it, but it's it is it we don't require it, but it's allowed. If you want to do a one for one allowed. If you want to do a one for one allowed. If you want to do a one for one copy from NVD, like you're a CNA and copy from NVD, like you're a CNA and copy from NVD, like you're a CNA and you're like, I I'll bring all those CPUs you're like, I I'll bring all those CPUs you're like, I I'll bring all those CPUs over and save my time, you can do a over and save my time, you can do a over and save my time, you can do a onetoone map and bring it over, but onetoone map and bring it over, but onetoone map and bring it over, but whereas they require it, but that that whereas they require it, but that that whereas they require it, but that that ID is something they generate for their ID is something they generate for their ID is something they generate for their needs. So, CNA can't self-generate that. needs. So, CNA can't self-generate that. needs. So, CNA can't self-generate that. So, we don't require it. That's right. So, we don't require it. That's right. So, we don't require it. That's right. Um so this record oh yeah this is Um so this record oh yeah this is Um so this record oh yeah this is working. Um this record is essentially working. Um this record is essentially working. Um this record is essentially just a very basic example one CPE just a very basic example one CPE just a very basic example one CPE identifier with the version specified um identifier with the version specified um identifier with the version specified um vulnerable true um and then you can vulnerable true um and then you can vulnerable true um and then you can compare that side by side with what is compare that side by side with what is compare that side by side with what is currently required in the affected array currently required in the affected array currently required in the affected array with the same product same version um with the same product same version um with the same product same version um affected. So that gives you anam or an affected. So that gives you anam or an affected. So that gives you anam or an idea of how they compare. idea of how they compare. idea of how they compare. very basic example very basic example very basic example though. Um, okay. So, moving on to what though. Um, okay. So, moving on to what though. Um, okay. So, moving on to what we will be uh releasing or what we will we will be uh releasing or what we will we will be uh releasing or what we will be including in the next release. Um, so be including in the next release. Um, so be including in the next release. Um, so again, we've got some more tightening of again, we've got some more tightening of again, we've got some more tightening of the schema specifically around the the schema specifically around the the schema specifically around the affected array. Um, we put in to affected array. Um, we put in to affected array. Um, we put in to disallow additional properties there as disallow additional properties there as disallow additional properties there as well as sometimes we do get mistyped well as sometimes we do get mistyped well as sometimes we do get mistyped property names in the affected array. property names in the affected array. property names in the affected array. Um, so we're cleaning that up. Um Um, so we're cleaning that up. Um Um, so we're cleaning that up. Um there's some more uh additional details there's some more uh additional details there's some more uh additional details for some of the uh example records in for some of the uh example records in for some of the uh example records in the repo. Um and some documentation the repo. Um and some documentation the repo. Um and some documentation updates. These are all things that we've updates. These are all things that we've updates. These are all things that we've got in our develop branch that are ready got in our develop branch that are ready got in our develop branch that are ready to go. Um mostly just basic stuff. Um to go. Um mostly just basic stuff. Um to go. Um mostly just basic stuff. Um did you have anything you want on this? did you have anything you want on this? did you have anything you want on this? Yeah, I mean there's been a lot of Yeah, I mean there's been a lot of Yeah, I mean there's been a lot of criticism about quality data quality and criticism about quality data quality and criticism about quality data quality and CV program. Not going to argue that CV program. Not going to argue that CV program. Not going to argue that because there is absolutely problems because there is absolutely problems because there is absolutely problems with data quality and CV program. Um, with data quality and CV program. Um, with data quality and CV program. Um, and so we're trying to tighten some and so we're trying to tighten some and so we're trying to tighten some things up. things up. things up. Uh, better validation. Some of it's Uh, better validation. Some of it's Uh, better validation. Some of it's learning from experience, seeing what learning from experience, seeing what learning from experience, seeing what goes in, people are uploading. Sometimes goes in, people are uploading. Sometimes goes in, people are uploading. Sometimes you think, you know, all the standard you think, you know, all the standard you think, you know, all the standard was the spec was clear and then you see was the spec was clear and then you see was the spec was clear and then you see the real world. It's like, okay, I guess the real world. It's like, okay, I guess the real world. It's like, okay, I guess it wasn't because people are doing it wasn't because people are doing it wasn't because people are doing things we didn't expect them to do. Uh, things we didn't expect them to do. Uh, things we didn't expect them to do. Uh, so there's some tightening up of so there's some tightening up of so there's some tightening up of validation. And well, I know there's a validation. And well, I know there's a validation. And well, I know there's a slide we have on this about the our slide we have on this about the our slide we have on this about the our GitHub repository, which is how this all GitHub repository, which is how this all GitHub repository, which is how this all works, is pull requests for all these works, is pull requests for all these works, is pull requests for all these changes. Um there are a bunch of things changes. Um there are a bunch of things changes. Um there are a bunch of things in there people have identified an open in there people have identified an open in there people have identified an open pull request for and people are welcome pull request for and people are welcome pull request for and people are welcome to do that which we'll mention of if you to do that which we'll mention of if you to do that which we'll mention of if you spot problems that need to be resolved spot problems that need to be resolved spot problems that need to be resolved and there isn't actually a ticket type and there isn't actually a ticket type and there isn't actually a ticket type thing for that to say hey there's an thing for that to say hey there's an thing for that to say hey there's an issue you create one. Um we're probably issue you create one. Um we're probably issue you create one. Um we're probably not going to tackle every validation not going to tackle every validation not going to tackle every validation problem in 512 but we we've been phasing problem in 512 but we we've been phasing problem in 512 but we we've been phasing those in over time and it depends also those in over time and it depends also those in over time and it depends also on how big of a change it is. Is it on how big of a change it is. Is it on how big of a change it is. Is it going to break a lot of records that going to break a lot of records that going to break a lot of records that exist in the corpus today? Those are exist in the corpus today? Those are exist in the corpus today? Those are harder changes to do. If it's like, oh, harder changes to do. If it's like, oh, harder changes to do. If it's like, oh, there's a dozen records this can affect, there's a dozen records this can affect, there's a dozen records this can affect, we can reach out to the CNA and ask them we can reach out to the CNA and ask them we can reach out to the CNA and ask them to fix things, that's a lot easier to to fix things, that's a lot easier to to fix things, that's a lot easier to get done. Uh, so it's there's we we get done. Uh, so it's there's we we get done. Uh, so it's there's we we totally recognize and acknowledge there totally recognize and acknowledge there totally recognize and acknowledge there are improvements we need to make and are improvements we need to make and are improvements we need to make and tighten up our data quality and we're tighten up our data quality and we're tighten up our data quality and we're working in that direction, but kind of working in that direction, but kind of working in that direction, but kind of at a steady pace. That's right. Yep. So, at a steady pace. That's right. Yep. So, at a steady pace. That's right. Yep. So, uh, like he said, like MZ said, the uh, like he said, like MZ said, the uh, like he said, like MZ said, the numbers are in this case either an issue numbers are in this case either an issue numbers are in this case either an issue number or a PR number depending. Yeah, number or a PR number depending. Yeah, number or a PR number depending. Yeah, it's pretty much all like GitHub pull it's pretty much all like GitHub pull it's pretty much all like GitHub pull request numbers if you want to go look request numbers if you want to go look request numbers if you want to go look those up. those up. those up. Yep. Um, so one of the big things we're Yep. Um, so one of the big things we're Yep. Um, so one of the big things we're working on for the next release, and working on for the next release, and working on for the next release, and this should go into the next release as this should go into the next release as this should go into the next release as long as we uh we can hurt all the cats long as we uh we can hurt all the cats long as we uh we can hurt all the cats in the QWG, is sever. So there was an in the QWG, is sever. So there was an in the QWG, is sever. So there was an overarching issue for this um that was overarching issue for this um that was overarching issue for this um that was around tightening up our version types. around tightening up our version types. around tightening up our version types. Um so we have a number of version types Um so we have a number of version types Um so we have a number of version types when you're defining affected products when you're defining affected products when you're defining affected products and versions. And funny enough, none of and versions. And funny enough, none of and versions. And funny enough, none of those do any validation on the data those do any validation on the data those do any validation on the data that's provided. So if it says SEver, um that's provided. So if it says SEver, um that's provided. So if it says SEver, um we don't check to make sure that that is we don't check to make sure that that is we don't check to make sure that that is actually SEver when it's entered into actually SEver when it's entered into actually SEver when it's entered into the record. Um, so we're looking to the record. Um, so we're looking to the record. Um, so we're looking to change that with a new version type change that with a new version type change that with a new version type called sever. Um, and we do have called sever. Um, and we do have called sever. Um, and we do have actually a pull request in right now. actually a pull request in right now. actually a pull request in right now. Um, to do the uh to do new properties Um, to do the uh to do new properties Um, to do the uh to do new properties for this as well as validate that it for this as well as validate that it for this as well as validate that it actually is actually is actually is several server provided. Yeah, that's several server provided. Yeah, that's several server provided. Yeah, that's the validation that Zenbear standard the validation that Zenbear standard the validation that Zenbear standard calls for that if you say it's Zare 2, calls for that if you say it's Zare 2, calls for that if you say it's Zare 2, it will it will be rejected unless it it will it will be rejected unless it it will it will be rejected unless it validates that it is SER 2. Yep. And you validates that it is SER 2. Yep. And you validates that it is SER 2. Yep. And you know, going back to Andrew's talk about know, going back to Andrew's talk about know, going back to Andrew's talk about cleaning up data, being able to better cleaning up data, being able to better cleaning up data, being able to better automate that, um, I think this is a automate that, um, I think this is a automate that, um, I think this is a step in that direction because what we'd step in that direction because what we'd step in that direction because what we'd be doing essentially is giving, uh, CNAs be doing essentially is giving, uh, CNAs be doing essentially is giving, uh, CNAs the ability to specify actual, uh, SE the ability to specify actual, uh, SE the ability to specify actual, uh, SE for versions and making sure that it's for versions and making sure that it's for versions and making sure that it's correct. correct. correct. Um I think there's still work to do on Um I think there's still work to do on Um I think there's still work to do on obviously vendor and product data that's obviously vendor and product data that's obviously vendor and product data that's provided to us but I have heard some provided to us but I have heard some provided to us but I have heard some stuff about uh Pearl validation of stuff about uh Pearl validation of stuff about uh Pearl validation of package names and some tools to help package names and some tools to help package names and some tools to help with that and there's a possibility we with that and there's a possibility we with that and there's a possibility we could integrate that either into the could integrate that either into the could integrate that either into the schema or we also could do it schema or we also could do it schema or we also could do it programmatically through the CVE programmatically through the CVE programmatically through the CVE services. Yeah, we work closely with the services. Yeah, we work closely with the services. Yeah, we work closely with the other working groups like the AWG which other working groups like the AWG which other working groups like the AWG which automation working group. they're the automation working group. they're the automation working group. they're the ones that handle CV services. So there ones that handle CV services. So there ones that handle CV services. So there are some things that are done that you are some things that are done that you are some things that are done that you can't necessarily do in a schema. Uh but can't necessarily do in a schema. Uh but can't necessarily do in a schema. Uh but you can do programmatically in code that you can do programmatically in code that you can do programmatically in code that so when something gets submitted to to so when something gets submitted to to so when something gets submitted to to the API, there's some additional steps the API, there's some additional steps the API, there's some additional steps that can be done there. So sometimes that can be done there. So sometimes that can be done there. So sometimes we're like h there's no good way for us we're like h there's no good way for us we're like h there's no good way for us to handle that, but it's still a good to handle that, but it's still a good to handle that, but it's still a good idea. Let's talk to AWG. And some of us idea. Let's talk to AWG. And some of us idea. Let's talk to AWG. And some of us are in all the working groups, so we are in all the working groups, so we are in all the working groups, so we just kind of and everything flows just kind of and everything flows just kind of and everything flows together. Um but there's a there's a together. Um but there's a there's a together. Um but there's a there's a couple of things we're wrestling with couple of things we're wrestling with couple of things we're wrestling with right now. So any input from the right now. So any input from the right now. So any input from the community is is great and we want more community is is great and we want more community is is great and we want more participation on the QWG. Um I know participation on the QWG. Um I know participation on the QWG. Um I know we're talking right now about um we've we're talking right now about um we've we're talking right now about um we've got a set of property names that we use got a set of property names that we use got a set of property names that we use for describing versions and version for describing versions and version for describing versions and version ranges. Um there's a proposal for this ranges. Um there's a proposal for this ranges. Um there's a proposal for this which uses slightly different names and which uses slightly different names and which uses slightly different names and we're not sure if we want to change that we're not sure if we want to change that we're not sure if we want to change that up on folks. Um but we're also up on folks. Um but we're also up on folks. Um but we're also interested to hear if there's better interested to hear if there's better interested to hear if there's better ways of doing it. Um this is another ways of doing it. Um this is another ways of doing it. Um this is another thing I talked to Andrew about. Go thing I talked to Andrew about. Go thing I talked to Andrew about. Go ahead. Do you have a mic? One way to do do it better would One way to do do it better would One way to do do it better would probably change to verse probably change to verse probably change to verse um in the version range specifier. Uh um in the version range specifier. Uh um in the version range specifier. Uh it's something that uh was developed in it's something that uh was developed in it's something that uh was developed in the Pearl community. It's currently the Pearl community. It's currently the Pearl community. It's currently being added to become an uh EMCA being added to become an uh EMCA being added to become an uh EMCA standard and basically it covers a lot standard and basically it covers a lot standard and basically it covers a lot of problems that you currently have. Um of problems that you currently have. Um of problems that you currently have. Um it covers the version types. Um since it covers the version types. Um since it covers the version types. Um since you can have different versioning you can have different versioning you can have different versioning schemes. It's not only s. It's not only schemes. It's not only s. It's not only schemes. It's not only s. It's not only uh the other things that we have npm, uh the other things that we have npm, uh the other things that we have npm, pi, all of them work a little bit pi, all of them work a little bit pi, all of them work a little bit different. Something that needs to different. Something that needs to different. Something that needs to support everything. And that's what support everything. And that's what support everything. And that's what we're looking for. Yeah. Yeah. we're looking for. Yeah. Yeah. we're looking for. Yeah. Yeah. Basically, the the nice thing about um Basically, the the nice thing about um Basically, the the nice thing about um verse is you have a generic scheme how verse is you have a generic scheme how verse is you have a generic scheme how it works and then you can add on um your it works and then you can add on um your it works and then you can add on um your version schemes and that can be added version schemes and that can be added version schemes and that can be added dynamically. So you don't have actually dynamically. So you don't have actually dynamically. So you don't have actually to change the um JSON schema ever every to change the um JSON schema ever every to change the um JSON schema ever every time there's a new uh version scheme time there's a new uh version scheme time there's a new uh version scheme added. you just have to update your um added. you just have to update your um added. you just have to update your um services and the new uh is the new services and the new uh is the new services and the new uh is the new schema is accepted. That's awesome. schema is accepted. That's awesome. schema is accepted. That's awesome. Well, in the interest of time, I Well, in the interest of time, I Well, in the interest of time, I let's let's talk after the session and let's let's talk after the session and let's let's talk after the session and figure out how we can start that figure out how we can start that figure out how we can start that conversation. Yeah, I think that has conversation. Yeah, I think that has conversation. Yeah, I think that has come up because there is this slide or come up because there is this slide or come up because there is this slide or the next slide. They were talking about the next slide. They were talking about the next slide. They were talking about Pearl at some point is in our slides. Uh Pearl at some point is in our slides. Uh Pearl at some point is in our slides. Uh yeah, we can move on. What's on the yeah, we can move on. What's on the yeah, we can move on. What's on the horizon? Yeah. Mhm. So, one of the horizon? Yeah. Mhm. So, one of the horizon? Yeah. Mhm. So, one of the things we're looking at right now, things we're looking at right now, things we're looking at right now, obviously, we talked CPE was added last obviously, we talked CPE was added last obviously, we talked CPE was added last year. Um, but we've said we're not the year. Um, but we've said we're not the year. Um, but we've said we're not the CVE programs responsibility isn't really CVE programs responsibility isn't really CVE programs responsibility isn't really to force the global adoption of any one to force the global adoption of any one to force the global adoption of any one software identifier. And I was on a software identifier. And I was on a software identifier. And I was on a panel earlier this week about software panel earlier this week about software panel earlier this week about software identifiers and there's some other identifiers and there's some other identifiers and there's some other discussions happening here. There is no discussions happening here. There is no discussions happening here. There is no universally accepted software identifier universally accepted software identifier universally accepted software identifier right now. like that you'll find people right now. like that you'll find people right now. like that you'll find people who passionately hate Pearl and who passionately hate Pearl and who passionately hate Pearl and passionately hate CPE and omnivore and passionately hate CPE and omnivore and passionately hate CPE and omnivore and basically there's people who are very basically there's people who are very basically there's people who are very religiously divided extremes extremes u religiously divided extremes extremes u religiously divided extremes extremes u our what we're trying to do is enable if our what we're trying to do is enable if our what we're trying to do is enable if what you're using let's allow you to do what you're using let's allow you to do what you're using let's allow you to do that in your record so if if you're that that in your record so if if you're that that in your record so if if you're that pearl's mostly uh I it's not there's a pearl's mostly uh I it's not there's a pearl's mostly uh I it's not there's a misconception that pearl is like the misconception that pearl is like the misconception that pearl is like the open source identifier it isn't but it's open source identifier it isn't but it's open source identifier it isn't but it's very widely adopted in open source very widely adopted in open source very widely adopted in open source compared to other systems So the compared to other systems So the compared to other systems So the uh we're looking at allowing pearl looks uh we're looking at allowing pearl looks uh we're looking at allowing pearl looks like we use CPE as a software identifier like we use CPE as a software identifier like we use CPE as a software identifier in the CV record and that's something in the CV record and that's something in the CV record and that's something probably in the next version of the probably in the next version of the probably in the next version of the schema or record format. Um just depends schema or record format. Um just depends schema or record format. Um just depends that again there's debates happening that again there's debates happening that again there's debates happening over how we do this and there are over how we do this and there are over how we do this and there are different things about the what how to different things about the what how to different things about the what how to represent Pearl in the in in our represent Pearl in the in in our represent Pearl in the in in our standard. Um, some of the stuff is standard. Um, some of the stuff is standard. Um, some of the stuff is probably in a slide about how you do the probably in a slide about how you do the probably in a slide about how you do the version numbers and do you do that version numbers and do you do that version numbers and do you do that embedded in the pearl itself or do you embedded in the pearl itself or do you embedded in the pearl itself or do you extract the version numbers and there's extract the version numbers and there's extract the version numbers and there's different people in the working group different people in the working group different people in the working group with different opinions and so there's with different opinions and so there's with different opinions and so there's debate happening right now. Yeah, there debate happening right now. Yeah, there debate happening right now. Yeah, there actually is a PR in our GitHub repo actually is a PR in our GitHub repo actually is a PR in our GitHub repo right now for adding Pearl using right now for adding Pearl using right now for adding Pearl using applicability language almost exactly applicability language almost exactly applicability language almost exactly like we do for CPE today. Um, so that is like we do for CPE today. Um, so that is like we do for CPE today. Um, so that is one way to do it, but we have not one way to do it, but we have not one way to do it, but we have not discussed that in detail and and made discussed that in detail and and made discussed that in detail and and made any decision decisions. I'd love to see any decision decisions. I'd love to see any decision decisions. I'd love to see other thoughts and potentially PRs from other thoughts and potentially PRs from other thoughts and potentially PRs from others in the community. Yeah, we have others in the community. Yeah, we have others in the community. Yeah, we have there's a poll request, you know, like I there's a poll request, you know, like I there's a poll request, you know, like I said, pearl requests are kind of how said, pearl requests are kind of how said, pearl requests are kind of how these ideas are floated. There's one for these ideas are floated. There's one for these ideas are floated. There's one for pearl, there's one for omnibore, there's pearl, there's one for omnibore, there's pearl, there's one for omnibore, there's a third one that is basically just to a third one that is basically just to a third one that is basically just to create a abstracted generic create a abstracted generic create a abstracted generic representation. So that like was said representation. So that like was said representation. So that like was said with about pearl can do where you could with about pearl can do where you could with about pearl can do where you could keep adding types without having to keep adding types without having to keep adding types without having to create a new type each time a new new create a new type each time a new new create a new type each time a new new representation each time. That's right. representation each time. That's right. representation each time. That's right. Um the other thing that that is on the Um the other thing that that is on the Um the other thing that that is on the horizon and I again we have this horizon and I again we have this horizon and I again we have this actually has a feature branch all I actually has a feature branch all I actually has a feature branch all I think for the most part ready to go. think for the most part ready to go. think for the most part ready to go. Thank you VJ. Um but the uh stakeholder Thank you VJ. Um but the uh stakeholder Thank you VJ. Um but the uh stakeholder specific vulnerability classification um specific vulnerability classification um specific vulnerability classification um SSVC that data is currently being SSVC that data is currently being SSVC that data is currently being provided by the CISA ADP but it is using provided by the CISA ADP but it is using provided by the CISA ADP but it is using a custom metric. Um so essentially it's a custom metric. Um so essentially it's a custom metric. Um so essentially it's something we put into the schema uh I'm something we put into the schema uh I'm something we put into the schema uh I'm sorry the record format um quite a while sorry the record format um quite a while sorry the record format um quite a while back to allow for uh experimental fields back to allow for uh experimental fields back to allow for uh experimental fields and in this case custom metrics that we and in this case custom metrics that we and in this case custom metrics that we didn't anticipate. Well, we're talking didn't anticipate. Well, we're talking didn't anticipate. Well, we're talking about adding in official support for about adding in official support for about adding in official support for this. So, following the specific SSV this. So, following the specific SSV this. So, following the specific SSV schema and the properties that are schema and the properties that are schema and the properties that are allowed and potentially moving the data allowed and potentially moving the data allowed and potentially moving the data that CISA has provided previously into that CISA has provided previously into that CISA has provided previously into this. Yeah, because the the record this. Yeah, because the the record this. Yeah, because the the record format does allow for experimental. It's format does allow for experimental. It's format does allow for experimental. It's like X that's - off top of my head. I'm like X that's - off top of my head. I'm like X that's - off top of my head. I'm going to forget, but you could add new going to forget, but you could add new going to forget, but you could add new elements, but that's not standardized. elements, but that's not standardized. elements, but that's not standardized. So if you're a So if you're a So if you're a consumer it doesn't help you so much consumer it doesn't help you so much consumer it doesn't help you so much because it's not really good definition because it's not really good definition because it's not really good definition of how is the state represented. The of how is the state represented. The of how is the state represented. The same thing with like the tools that are same thing with like the tools that are same thing with like the tools that are used voggram started using was X used voggram started using was X used voggram started using was X originator or X X generator generator. originator or X X generator generator. originator or X X generator generator. Yeah X generator like describe the tool. Yeah X generator like describe the tool. Yeah X generator like describe the tool. So we're looking at adding like So we're looking at adding like So we're looking at adding like generator as a standard tag for the generator as a standard tag for the generator as a standard tag for the different tools that are out there so different tools that are out there so different tools that are out there so that downstream consumers have a that downstream consumers have a that downstream consumers have a standardized documented way to consume standardized documented way to consume standardized documented way to consume this data instead of whoever feels like this data instead of whoever feels like this data instead of whoever feels like throwing an X something in there. And so throwing an X something in there. And so throwing an X something in there. And so we're looking at adding SSVC uh because we're looking at adding SSVC uh because we're looking at adding SSVC uh because it is actively being used uh but right it is actively being used uh but right it is actively being used uh but right now it's not standardized and that way now it's not standardized and that way now it's not standardized and that way if somebody else wants to use it there if somebody else wants to use it there if somebody else wants to use it there be a standardized way of doing it and we be a standardized way of doing it and we be a standardized way of doing it and we can then add validation. Obviously if can then add validation. Obviously if can then add validation. Obviously if it's an expramable tag being stuck in it's an expramable tag being stuck in it's an expramable tag being stuck in there by a supplier there's no there by a supplier there's no there by a supplier there's no validation behind that because it's just validation behind that because it's just validation behind that because it's just being stuck in there randomly by a being stuck in there randomly by a being stuck in there randomly by a supplier. So we can start enforcing supplier. So we can start enforcing supplier. So we can start enforcing structure on that. Make sure data structure on that. Make sure data structure on that. Make sure data quality again. And in this case this quality again. And in this case this quality again. And in this case this isn't even an X field. This is a custom isn't even an X field. This is a custom isn't even an X field. This is a custom metric which we it's sort of similar but metric which we it's sort of similar but metric which we it's sort of similar but not defined. It's a bit of a clooch. not defined. It's a bit of a clooch. not defined. It's a bit of a clooch. Yep. So, um this actually does dovetail Yep. So, um this actually does dovetail Yep. So, um this actually does dovetail into this discussion. Um so, we haven't into this discussion. Um so, we haven't into this discussion. Um so, we haven't talked a lot about this, but I this is talked a lot about this, but I this is talked a lot about this, but I this is going to I'm sure cause a lot of um going to I'm sure cause a lot of um going to I'm sure cause a lot of um chaos on the QWG as well as in the chaos on the QWG as well as in the chaos on the QWG as well as in the community. Um there's going to be times community. Um there's going to be times community. Um there's going to be times where we're going to have to remove where we're going to have to remove where we're going to have to remove properties and and arrays and and make properties and and arrays and and make properties and and arrays and and make big changes. Um and we're not we've not big changes. Um and we're not we've not big changes. Um and we're not we've not done this yet. No, the under five I mean done this yet. No, the under five I mean done this yet. No, the under five I mean yeah since the 50 schema rolled out yeah since the 50 schema rolled out yeah since the 50 schema rolled out whatever schema rolled out we really whatever schema rolled out we really whatever schema rolled out we really haven't removed anything between four haven't removed anything between four haven't removed anything between four and five major change lots of stuff and five major change lots of stuff and five major change lots of stuff changed but think like the number one changed but think like the number one changed but think like the number one example I can think of would be the old example I can think of would be the old example I can think of would be the old CVE array. Yeah the CPE I'm sorry CPE CVE array. Yeah the CPE I'm sorry CPE CVE array. Yeah the CPE I'm sorry CPE array. um that's now been replaced with array. um that's now been replaced with array. um that's now been replaced with a better a better a better representation. We need to look at how representation. We need to look at how representation. We need to look at how do we deprecate that old so people stop do we deprecate that old so people stop do we deprecate that old so people stop using it if they're still using it and using it if they're still using it and using it if they're still using it and push them to the new one. Uh and so push them to the new one. Uh and so push them to the new one. Uh and so that's a discussion that's kind of just that's a discussion that's kind of just that's a discussion that's kind of just started people some people have brought started people some people have brought started people some people have brought it up like we need a way if there's it up like we need a way if there's it up like we need a way if there's something in the schema or you know in something in the schema or you know in something in the schema or you know in the record format that's no one's using the record format that's no one's using the record format that's no one's using or is obsoleted in some way. How do you or is obsoleted in some way. How do you or is obsoleted in some way. How do you phase that out uh to get people to use phase that out uh to get people to use phase that out uh to get people to use the new stuff or just to remove clutter the new stuff or just to remove clutter the new stuff or just to remove clutter so that the so that the record format so that the so that the record format so that the so that the record format doesn't accrete over time and end up doesn't accrete over time and end up doesn't accrete over time and end up being a giant format where only 10% of being a giant format where only 10% of being a giant format where only 10% of it's being used? it's being used? it's being used? Yep. Yeah. And in this case the that Yep. Yeah. And in this case the that Yep. Yeah. And in this case the that data is pretty complex to try and figure data is pretty complex to try and figure data is pretty complex to try and figure out what to do with if we wanted to move out what to do with if we wanted to move out what to do with if we wanted to move it. Um because like you were saying it. Um because like you were saying it. Um because like you were saying earlier, is it a fixed CPE? Is it an earlier, is it a fixed CPE? Is it an earlier, is it a fixed CPE? Is it an affected CPE? It is is it a CPE match affected CPE? It is is it a CPE match affected CPE? It is is it a CPE match string of some sort? Yeah, that would be string of some sort? Yeah, that would be string of some sort? Yeah, that would be kind of situation where we'd probably kind of situation where we'd probably kind of situation where we'd probably have to reach out to the CNAs and say, have to reach out to the CNAs and say, have to reach out to the CNAs and say, "Hey, can you please migrate this over "Hey, can you please migrate this over "Hey, can you please migrate this over by this?" We had to do this before with by this?" We had to do this before with by this?" We had to do this before with some things and go to CPCNAs and say, some things and go to CPCNAs and say, some things and go to CPCNAs and say, "Hey, here we're going to be phasing "Hey, here we're going to be phasing "Hey, here we're going to be phasing this field out. If you want this data to this field out. If you want this data to this field out. If you want this data to still be in your records, please migrate still be in your records, please migrate still be in your records, please migrate it by this date and give them like a it by this date and give them like a it by this date and give them like a six-month window or something." That's six-month window or something." That's six-month window or something." That's right. And we have had some experience right. And we have had some experience right. And we have had some experience with that. There have been some times with that. There have been some times with that. There have been some times where we've had to make minor changes where we've had to make minor changes where we've had to make minor changes and CNAs have had to clean up some and CNAs have had to clean up some and CNAs have had to clean up some stuff. Um, which has gone well. I think stuff. Um, which has gone well. I think stuff. Um, which has gone well. I think we've gotten them to update in most in we've gotten them to update in most in we've gotten them to update in most in almost every case. Um but we are almost every case. Um but we are almost every case. Um but we are starting to think about you know how do starting to think about you know how do starting to think about you know how do we notify the community when these kinds we notify the community when these kinds we notify the community when these kinds of changes are going to happen. Um is 6 of changes are going to happen. Um is 6 of changes are going to happen. Um is 6 months sufficient and in what way do we months sufficient and in what way do we months sufficient and in what way do we do that? You know after you submit do that? You know after you submit do that? You know after you submit something um maybe we watch the logs and something um maybe we watch the logs and something um maybe we watch the logs and send you something through email later. send you something through email later. send you something through email later. Hey you know what this property is going Hey you know what this property is going Hey you know what this property is going to go away or this array is going to get to go away or this array is going to get to go away or this array is going to get changed in this way. Yeah. There has to changed in this way. Yeah. There has to changed in this way. Yeah. There has to probably be a phased approach right just probably be a phased approach right just probably be a phased approach right just turn it off. Yep. That's right. So, turn it off. Yep. That's right. So, turn it off. Yep. That's right. So, these are all things that we'd love these are all things that we'd love these are all things that we'd love input on to Oh, I'll come to you. Based on my experience with dealing with Based on my experience with dealing with Based on my experience with dealing with customers, usually uh a phased approach customers, usually uh a phased approach customers, usually uh a phased approach should look something more like uh an should look something more like uh an should look something more like uh an API versioning change. So, you know, you API versioning change. So, you know, you API versioning change. So, you know, you tell them in six months we're going to tell them in six months we're going to tell them in six months we're going to have a new version endpoint and then six have a new version endpoint and then six have a new version endpoint and then six months later we're going to turn off the months later we're going to turn off the months later we're going to turn off the old one. So maybe more like 12 years of old one. So maybe more like 12 years of old one. So maybe more like 12 years of old data or 12 months, sorry. Yeah, old data or 12 months, sorry. Yeah, old data or 12 months, sorry. Yeah, that's what we're looking at. Probably that's what we're looking at. Probably that's what we're looking at. Probably have type of thing where you start have type of thing where you start have type of thing where you start getting a warning. Hey, you're using getting a warning. Hey, you're using getting a warning. Hey, you're using something that's deprecated. Do you have something that's deprecated. Do you have something that's deprecated. Do you have here's a clock counting down like you here's a clock counting down like you here's a clock counting down like you got to stop and then we turn it off at got to stop and then we turn it off at got to stop and then we turn it off at some point. And if you try to submit at some point. And if you try to submit at some point. And if you try to submit at that point with a with something that's that point with a with something that's that point with a with something that's now off, your record gets rejected. Like now off, your record gets rejected. Like now off, your record gets rejected. Like if you want to submit this, you have to if you want to submit this, you have to if you want to submit this, you have to change. We had to do that when we went change. We had to do that when we went change. We had to do that when we went from 50 to 51. There were some things from 50 to 51. There were some things from 50 to 51. There were some things that were really broken in the 50 schema that were really broken in the 50 schema that were really broken in the 50 schema that were allowing bad data structure that were allowing bad data structure that were allowing bad data structure and we turned enforcement on to stop and we turned enforcement on to stop and we turned enforcement on to stop that which meant there were some CNAs that which meant there were some CNAs that which meant there were some CNAs whose tooling had to change or they whose tooling had to change or they whose tooling had to change or they could no longer submit CVE. could no longer submit CVE. could no longer submit CVE. That's right. We got three minutes left. That's right. We got three minutes left. That's right. We got three minutes left. So just to get through these quick um I So just to get through these quick um I So just to get through these quick um I mentioned that we have a GitHub repo. It mentioned that we have a GitHub repo. It mentioned that we have a GitHub repo. It is CVE-S schema. Um so feel free to is CVE-S schema. Um so feel free to is CVE-S schema. Um so feel free to browse, take a look, add comments, browse, take a look, add comments, browse, take a look, add comments, submit, get involved, submit things. submit, get involved, submit things. submit, get involved, submit things. Yeah, we'd love it. Yeah, we'd love it. Yeah, we'd love it. Um, questions. I think we have some time Um, questions. I think we have some time Um, questions. I think we have some time for questions. I put a few things up on for questions. I put a few things up on for questions. I put a few things up on the the screen, but uh um if people in the the screen, but uh um if people in the the screen, but uh um if people in the room have questions, we would love the room have questions, we would love the room have questions, we would love to hear. And there's nothing in this to hear. And there's nothing in this to hear. And there's nothing in this room after this. So, I'm happy to hang room after this. So, I'm happy to hang room after this. So, I'm happy to hang out. Yeah, I can as well. Question from trying to get to the Question from trying to get to the Question from trying to get to the microphone because this one's Oh, there microphone because this one's Oh, there microphone because this one's Oh, there it goes. There it goes. Okay. So, it goes. There it goes. Okay. So, it goes. There it goes. Okay. So, there's a lot of chatter in um in there's a lot of chatter in um in there's a lot of chatter in um in Discord. a lot of positive feedback and Discord. a lot of positive feedback and Discord. a lot of positive feedback and some suggestions uh re relating to Pearl some suggestions uh re relating to Pearl some suggestions uh re relating to Pearl with what relating to what this with what relating to what this with what relating to what this gentleman pointed out. But there was one gentleman pointed out. But there was one gentleman pointed out. But there was one question um beyond SER are there any question um beyond SER are there any question um beyond SER are there any plans or interest for Calver calendar plans or interest for Calver calendar plans or interest for Calver calendar versioning in the future. Uh well can versioning in the future. Uh well can versioning in the future. Uh well can you say it one more time because I'm not you say it one more time because I'm not you say it one more time because I'm not familiar with it. Sure. Um it was when familiar with it. Sure. Um it was when familiar with it. Sure. Um it was when you were going over um the schema a you were going over um the schema a you were going over um the schema a little bit earlier and someone had asked little bit earlier and someone had asked little bit earlier and someone had asked beyond sever beyond sever beyond sever is there any plan or interest for Calver is there any plan or interest for Calver is there any plan or interest for Calver calendar versioning in the future? Um so calendar versioning in the future? Um so calendar versioning in the future? Um so I haven't heard that one yet but I will I haven't heard that one yet but I will I haven't heard that one yet but I will I will be happy to to look into that and I will be happy to to look into that and I will be happy to to look into that and if you want to submit pull request a if you want to submit pull request a if you want to submit pull request a poll request or a or an issue for that poll request or a or an issue for that poll request or a or an issue for that or a discussion that would be great. Um, or a discussion that would be great. Um, or a discussion that would be great. Um, so I will put the uh yeah because we do so I will put the uh yeah because we do so I will put the uh yeah because we do support more server is obviously not the support more server is obviously not the support more server is obviously not the only there's custom and there's GitHub only there's custom and there's GitHub only there's custom and there's GitHub like I can't off top of my head I can't like I can't off top of my head I can't like I can't off top of my head I can't remember all the type I think we have remember all the type I think we have remember all the type I think we have UPC and there's several different UPC and there's several different UPC and there's several different several different uh versioning schemes several different uh versioning schemes several different uh versioning schemes that are supported but what we're trying that are supported but what we're trying that are supported but what we're trying to do now is add validation like SER is to do now is add validation like SER is to do now is add validation like SER is the first one was widely well somewhat the first one was widely well somewhat the first one was widely well somewhat widely used and it has a defined widely used and it has a defined widely used and it has a defined uh validation system so we're that's uh validation system so we're that's uh validation system so we're that's that's like an easy lowhanging fruit and that's like an easy lowhanging fruit and that's like an easy lowhanging fruit and somebody was willing to do the work. somebody was willing to do the work. somebody was willing to do the work. Somebody wrote the poll request and did Somebody wrote the poll request and did Somebody wrote the poll request and did and and and so it makes it easy for us. and and and so it makes it easy for us. and and and so it makes it easy for us. Somebody wrote the poll request up. Um Somebody wrote the poll request up. Um Somebody wrote the poll request up. Um but there's there's other things, you but there's there's other things, you but there's there's other things, you know, we just we do want to keep adding know, we just we do want to keep adding know, we just we do want to keep adding uh anything that's widely supported by uh anything that's widely supported by uh anything that's widely supported by industry or or in demand, especially if industry or or in demand, especially if industry or or in demand, especially if we can add validation to it. We're we're we can add validation to it. We're we're we can add validation to it. We're we're totally open. Yeah, I think no, there totally open. Yeah, I think no, there totally open. Yeah, I think no, there was I don't know if I made it clear, but was I don't know if I made it clear, but was I don't know if I made it clear, but there we're not stopping with Ember. So there we're not stopping with Ember. So there we're not stopping with Ember. So we'll add whatever makes sense and we we'll add whatever makes sense and we we'll add whatever makes sense and we also want to make sure that we validate also want to make sure that we validate also want to make sure that we validate that data coming in so that it is good that data coming in so that it is good that data coming in so that it is good quality data consumers. Yep. Yeah. And quality data consumers. Yep. Yeah. And quality data consumers. Yep. Yeah. And they heard what you said about you know they heard what you said about you know they heard what you said about you know requesting for them to go in and requesting for them to go in and requesting for them to go in and participate and do you know pull participate and do you know pull participate and do you know pull requests and such but um there are some requests and such but um there are some requests and such but um there are some helpful links that were added into the helpful links that were added into the helpful links that were added into the the Discord. But we have another the Discord. But we have another the Discord. But we have another question over here. question over here. question over here. Yeah. More of a comment. Um before you Yeah. More of a comment. Um before you Yeah. More of a comment. Um before you go through the trouble and um trying to go through the trouble and um trying to go through the trouble and um trying to add all the formats by yourself, I add all the formats by yourself, I add all the formats by yourself, I really encourage you to look at verse. really encourage you to look at verse. really encourage you to look at verse. Um we using the same thing in CESF. Um Um we using the same thing in CESF. Um Um we using the same thing in CESF. Um so we actually put quite some effort in so we actually put quite some effort in so we actually put quite some effort in to get useful things in in there and to to get useful things in in there and to to get useful things in in there and to get versioning schemes and validation in get versioning schemes and validation in get versioning schemes and validation in there. Um so you can actually profit out there. Um so you can actually profit out there. Um so you can actually profit out of that. That would be great. We'll take of that. That would be great. We'll take of that. That would be great. We'll take a look. Yeah, we definitely will take a a look. Yeah, we definitely will take a a look. Yeah, we definitely will take a look. Um, this is a plug just is this look. Um, this is a plug just is this look. Um, this is a plug just is this what you were talking about? Yeah, about what you were talking about? Yeah, about what you were talking about? Yeah, about joining us. The quality working group. joining us. The quality working group. joining us. The quality working group. Um, I know I think our charter needs to Um, I know I think our charter needs to Um, I know I think our charter needs to be updated because I it's it's uh we're be updated because I it's it's uh we're be updated because I it's it's uh we're working on an update. We're working on working on an update. We're working on working on an update. We're working on an update. It's I think it currently an update. It's I think it currently an update. It's I think it currently says that it's only for CNAs, but we can says that it's only for CNAs, but we can says that it's only for CNAs, but we can make exceptions. Um, and I definitely make exceptions. Um, and I definitely make exceptions. Um, and I definitely will. I I with our focus on consumers, I will. I I with our focus on consumers, I will. I I with our focus on consumers, I want more participation in the QWG, and want more participation in the QWG, and want more participation in the QWG, and that means from consumers. So, you don't that means from consumers. So, you don't that means from consumers. So, you don't have to be a CNA to join. Um, but if you have to be a CNA to join.

Yeah. And it is I mean it's or both. Yeah. And it is I mean it's or both. Yeah. And it is I mean it's pretty easy for CNAs to join. It's pretty easy for CNAs to join. It's pretty easy for CNAs to join. It's basically it's open on your CNA. If basically it's open on your CNA. If basically it's open on your CNA. If you're not a CNA, like you're a consumer you're not a CNA, like you're a consumer you're not a CNA, like you're a consumer and you and because we still haven't set and you and because we still haven't set and you and because we still haven't set up that consumer feedback group that I'm up that consumer feedback group that I'm up that consumer feedback group that I'm really hoping we do, um we can I believe really hoping we do, um we can I believe really hoping we do, um we can I believe that as chairs, there's also that that as chairs, there's also that that as chairs, there's also that ability for a chair to like in invited ability for a chair to like in invited ability for a chair to like in invited expert type thing where a chair can expert type thing where a chair can expert type thing where a chair can approve someone to be a member CNA. We approve someone to be a member CNA. We approve someone to be a member CNA. We do have some people in there right now I do have some people in there right now I do have some people in there right now I think aren't CNAs or maybe they're not. think aren't CNAs or maybe they're not. think aren't CNAs or maybe they're not. Yeah, I don't I think there's definitely Yeah, I don't I think there's definitely Yeah, I don't I think there's definitely some folks that aren't CNAs for sure. Uh some folks that aren't CNAs for sure. Uh some folks that aren't CNAs for sure. Uh but yeah, more representing like the but yeah, more representing like the but yeah, more representing like the data science, data mining side of the data science, data mining side of the data science, data mining side of the world uh looking for helping to improve world uh looking for helping to improve world uh looking for helping to improve the records because it makes their life the records because it makes their life the records because it makes their life easier. That's right. easier. That's right. easier. That's right. We have um a bunch of questions related We have um a bunch of questions related We have um a bunch of questions related to ADPs. I don't know if you guys are to ADPs. I don't know if you guys are to ADPs. I don't know if you guys are the right audience for it, but we're the right audience for it, but we're the right audience for it, but we're here. So, I'm going to ask the first one here. So, I'm going to ask the first one here. So, I'm going to ask the first one is probably going to take you a while to is probably going to take you a while to is probably going to take you a while to answer. Why is it so hard to become an answer. Why is it so hard to become an answer. Why is it so hard to become an ADP? Because I've heard a lot of people ADP? Because I've heard a lot of people ADP? Because I've heard a lot of people complain about it. So far, it's gone. complain about it. So far, it's gone. complain about it. So far, it's gone. Let me put my other hat on. Let me put my other hat on. Let me put my other hat on. Um, ADP uh I will agree uh how do I say Um, ADP uh I will agree uh how do I say Um, ADP uh I will agree uh how do I say this? I want don't get myself too much this? I want don't get myself too much this? I want don't get myself too much trouble. So the uh this is being trouble. So the uh this is being trouble. So the uh this is being recorded. ADP is fairly new. I mean we recorded. ADP is fairly new. I mean we recorded. ADP is fairly new. I mean we started off small. Basically there's started off small. Basically there's started off small. Basically there's there's basically only really two ADPs there's basically only really two ADPs there's basically only really two ADPs right now. There's CISA and the right now. There's CISA and the right now. There's CISA and the secretariat technically is using an ADP secretariat technically is using an ADP secretariat technically is using an ADP functionality now. functionality now. functionality now. Um it was kind of crawl walk crawl walk Um it was kind of crawl walk crawl walk Um it was kind of crawl walk crawl walk run approach of like is this going to run approach of like is this going to run approach of like is this going to work like because it was the first work like because it was the first work like because it was the first launching ADP is this going to break launching ADP is this going to break launching ADP is this going to break everybody at this point I think we've everybody at this point I think we've everybody at this point I think we've proven it's working you know I I know proven it's working you know I I know proven it's working you know I I know not everybody's fully happy with it but not everybody's fully happy with it but not everybody's fully happy with it but it's not breaking the world so so you it's not breaking the world so so you it's not breaking the world so so you can do more we do have some others in can do more we do have some others in can do more we do have some others in the wings I can't really name anybody the wings I can't really name anybody the wings I can't really name anybody because that'd be overstepping my bounds because that'd be overstepping my bounds because that'd be overstepping my bounds but the there are some others who are but the there are some others who are but the there are some others who are looking at providing other types of of looking at providing other types of of looking at providing other types of of records or or like scoring system records or or like scoring system records or or like scoring system enhancements or different things. So, enhancements or different things. So, enhancements or different things. So, we've talked some others. I am a big we've talked some others. I am a big we've talked some others. I am a big advocate as a advocate as a advocate as a CNA for CNA adps because one thing I CNA for CNA adps because one thing I CNA for CNA adps because one thing I we've heard from several people at this we've heard from several people at this we've heard from several people at this at the show here too um the at the show here too um the at the show here too um the conversations I've had and just feedback conversations I've had and just feedback conversations I've had and just feedback we've gotten. One of the things that we've gotten. One of the things that we've gotten. One of the things that happens in the real world like a third happens in the real world like a third happens in the real world like a third party CV gets published, open source party CV gets published, open source party CV gets published, open source like open SSL something gets published, like open SSL something gets published, like open SSL something gets published, CV goes out there. I'm with F5. We use CV goes out there. I'm with F5. We use CV goes out there. I'm with F5. We use that in our products and so but how it that in our products and so but how it that in our products and so but how it affects our product isn't the same as affects our product isn't the same as affects our product isn't the same as the generic CVE. Cisco uses it. Red Hat the generic CVE. Cisco uses it. Red Hat the generic CVE. Cisco uses it. Red Hat uses it. And so we all end up publishing uses it. And so we all end up publishing uses it. And so we all end up publishing security advisories for this third party security advisories for this third party security advisories for this third party CVE on our websites that our customers CVE on our websites that our customers CVE on our websites that our customers have to go find. But there is currently have to go find. But there is currently have to go find. But there is currently no way for us to feed that information no way for us to feed that information no way for us to feed that information in an effective especially structured in an effective especially structured in an effective especially structured data format back into that CVE record so data format back into that CVE record so data format back into that CVE record so that you have one source of truth. I that you have one source of truth. I that you have one source of truth. I want to see the ability of CNAs like want to see the ability of CNAs like want to see the ability of CNAs like within your scope. Like for me, I within your scope. Like for me, I within your scope. Like for me, I wouldn't be able to publish because wouldn't be able to publish because wouldn't be able to publish because because ADPs have a scope assigned to because ADPs have a scope assigned to because ADPs have a scope assigned to them and if you overstep your bounds, them and if you overstep your bounds, them and if you overstep your bounds, you can get removed from the program. So you can get removed from the program. So you can get removed from the program. So I would want to be able to publish how I would want to be able to publish how I would want to be able to publish how does a CV affect an F5 product. I does a CV affect an F5 product. I does a CV affect an F5 product. I wouldn't talk about Dell or Cisco or wouldn't talk about Dell or Cisco or wouldn't talk about Dell or Cisco or anybody else but my products and they anybody else but my products and they anybody else but my products and they can do their products. So that so I do can do their products. So that so I do can do their products. So that so I do want to see that program expanded. I'm want to see that program expanded. I'm want to see that program expanded. I'm advocating for that internally. Um, and advocating for that internally. Um, and advocating for that internally. Um, and so I'd like to see more of that so that so I'd like to see more of that so that so I'd like to see more of that so that more people could find useful data, not more people could find useful data, not more people could find useful data, not have to go find references and hunt have to go find references and hunt have to go find references and hunt around the internet for how does a CVE around the internet for how does a CVE around the internet for how does a CVE affect things other than the original affect things other than the original affect things other than the original generic thing. That's right. Because we generic thing. That's right. Because we generic thing. That's right. Because we all know that for some CVE records, I all know that for some CVE records, I all know that for some CVE records, I will give an example that I talked to will give an example that I talked to will give an example that I talked to somebody about the other day, um, was a somebody about the other day, um, was a somebody about the other day, um, was a Linux kernel CVE. Um, that affects tons Linux kernel CVE. Um, that affects tons Linux kernel CVE. Um, that affects tons of us. Um, so and and in a lot of of us. Um, so and and in a lot of of us. Um, so and and in a lot of different ways. So it would be great for different ways. So it would be great for different ways. So it would be great for CNAs and I think this is part of the CNAs and I think this is part of the CNAs and I think this is part of the problem too, right? It's kind of scary problem too, right? It's kind of scary problem too, right? It's kind of scary to think about that almost every CNA to think about that almost every CNA to think about that almost every CNA could potentially have a product that is could potentially have a product that is could potentially have a product that is affected in some way by the Linux affected in some way by the Linux affected in some way by the Linux kernel. So then you would have an ADP kernel. So then you would have an ADP kernel. So then you would have an ADP container for every single affected uh container for every single affected uh container for every single affected uh yeah quite possibly. So what would that yeah quite possibly. So what would that yeah quite possibly. So what would that look like? How would we present it? Um I look like? How would we present it? Um I look like? How would we present it? Um I think it just becomes a presentation think it just becomes a presentation think it just becomes a presentation problem at that point. But but yes, the problem at that point. But but yes, the problem at that point. But but yes, the JSON could get rather large. JSON could get rather large. JSON could get rather large. I think that almost answers my second I think that almost answers my second I think that almost answers my second and third question. Um, so you're and third question. Um, so you're and third question. Um, so you're proposing that ADPs only actually be proposing that ADPs only actually be proposing that ADPs only actually be product vendors and my second question product vendors and my second question product vendors and my second question would be will SEA tool vendors be would be will SEA tool vendors be would be will SEA tool vendors be allowed to be ADPs and input information allowed to be ADPs and input information allowed to be ADPs and input information on products that are not their own. on products that are not their own. on products that are not their own. Uh, I want to be clear. I'm not saying Uh, I want to be clear. I'm not saying Uh, I want to be clear. I'm not saying only I want to that's that right now only I want to that's that right now only I want to that's that right now there is no support for vendor CNA and I there is no support for vendor CNA and I there is no support for vendor CNA and I vendor vendor ADP and I do want to see vendor vendor ADP and I do want to see vendor vendor ADP and I do want to see that or CNA also being ADP. That's that or CNA also being ADP. That's that or CNA also being ADP. That's something I want to see added. But like something I want to see added. But like something I want to see added. But like right now the like SISA obviously is not right now the like SISA obviously is not right now the like SISA obviously is not a vendor and they're they're an ADP and a vendor and they're they're an ADP and a vendor and they're they're an ADP and some of the others that we are actively some of the others that we are actively some of the others that we are actively talking to who want to be ADPs, they are talking to who want to be ADPs, they are talking to who want to be ADPs, they are not vendors. Well, they are vendors in not vendors. Well, they are vendors in not vendors. Well, they are vendors in some way but not product vendors. some way but not product vendors. some way but not product vendors. They're like tools vendors, scanning They're like tools vendors, scanning They're like tools vendors, scanning tool vendors, whatever. Um allowing tool vendors, whatever. Um allowing tool vendors, whatever. Um allowing third parties to issue information, third parties to issue information, third parties to issue information, provide information that say contradicts provide information that say contradicts provide information that say contradicts the CNA, that gets very thorny and very the CNA, that gets very thorny and very the CNA, that gets very thorny and very political because we have had CNA say if political because we have had CNA say if political because we have had CNA say if you do that I'm no longer a CNA. Like if you do that I'm no longer a CNA. Like if you do that I'm no longer a CNA. Like if you start li we have people who are you start li we have people who are you start li we have people who are angry about NBD and are adamantly angry about NBD and are adamantly angry about NBD and are adamantly opposed to NVD being uh an ADP which is opposed to NVD being uh an ADP which is opposed to NVD being uh an ADP which is something I'm in supporting of. I'd something I'm in supporting of. I'd something I'm in supporting of. I'd rather see them join the program than do rather see them join the program than do rather see them join the program than do their own thing because there are people their own thing because there are people their own thing because there are people who hate what NVD does and cont know who hate what NVD does and cont know who hate what NVD does and cont know they issue their own score and it they issue their own score and it they issue their own score and it contradicts the vendor and and I as a contradicts the vendor and and I as a contradicts the vendor and and I as a vendor I get that. I hate when they vendor I get that. I hate when they vendor I get that. I hate when they contradict us because they're usually contradict us because they're usually contradict us because they're usually wrong. I will say that point blank. I wrong. I will say that point blank. I wrong. I will say that point blank. I disagree strongly with most of their disagree strongly with most of their disagree strongly with most of their scores. Uh, so the if you allow them to scores. Uh, so the if you allow them to scores. Uh, so the if you allow them to start coming into the record, I'm still start coming into the record, I'm still start coming into the record, I'm still in favor of making an ADP, but it in favor of making an ADP, but it in favor of making an ADP, but it definitely is a very hot button topic. definitely is a very hot button topic. definitely is a very hot button topic. Oh, you got it. Yeah. just while we're talking quality. Yeah. just while we're talking quality. Yeah. just while we're talking quality. So, one of the things I I'm hearing and So, one of the things I I'm hearing and So, one of the things I I'm hearing and I I've been hearing it all week is um I I've been hearing it all week is um I I've been hearing it all week is um the going to and you know being able to the going to and you know being able to the going to and you know being able to publish uh data for consumption via APIs publish uh data for consumption via APIs publish uh data for consumption via APIs and via other programs. Something that and via other programs. Something that and via other programs. Something that when it comes to CVES is kind of when it comes to CVES is kind of when it comes to CVES is kind of important is the is the narrative important is the is the narrative important is the is the narrative fields. And when you talk about one of fields. And when you talk about one of fields. And when you talk about one of the things I've noted is there's some the things I've noted is there's some the things I've noted is there's some vendors that basically when a CV is vendors that basically when a CV is vendors that basically when a CV is published there's almost nothing in the published there's almost nothing in the published there's almost nothing in the narrative fields. There's just pointers narrative fields. There's just pointers narrative fields. There's just pointers to the to their website. Y is there to the to their website. Y is there to the to their website. Y is there anyone from Microsoft in the room by the anyone from Microsoft in the room by the anyone from Microsoft in the room by the way? And um then you go to the you way? And um then you go to the you way? And um then you go to the you follow the link to the website and follow the link to the website and follow the link to the website and essentially there's just you know their essentially there's just you know their essentially there's just you know their position on on the uh on that particular position on on the uh on that particular position on on the uh on that particular uh vulnerability which isn't always uh vulnerability which isn't always uh vulnerability which isn't always tremendously useful. Um so you're not tremendously useful. Um so you're not tremendously useful. Um so you're not doing away with narratives I hope. Is doing away with narratives I hope. Is doing away with narratives I hope. Is there a future the description field? there a future the description field? there a future the description field? Right. Yeah. or even other nar I mean Right. Yeah. or even other nar I mean Right. Yeah. or even other nar I mean narrative fields in terms of process narrative fields in terms of process narrative fields in terms of process human reading of CVE data is kind of human reading of CVE data is kind of human reading of CVE data is kind of important and actually as we go forward important and actually as we go forward important and actually as we go forward through the development of APIs having through the development of APIs having through the development of APIs having those being able to pull those narrative those being able to pull those narrative those being able to pull those narrative fields and and have that text that goes fields and and have that text that goes fields and and have that text that goes actually and is usable by consuming actually and is usable by consuming actually and is usable by consuming programs still very very valuable but programs still very very valuable but programs still very very valuable but it's something that again some vendors it's something that again some vendors it's something that again some vendors just leave it blank so yeah and I think just leave it blank so yeah and I think just leave it blank so yeah and I think that the only way we fix that and this that the only way we fix that and this that the only way we fix that and this goes back to Andrew's talk was we have goes back to Andrew's talk was we have goes back to Andrew's talk was we have to I if if there's a a need we have to to I if if there's a a need we have to to I if if there's a a need we have to raise the min minimum requirements. Um, raise the min minimum requirements. Um, raise the min minimum requirements. Um, so, so that I think the only way that so, so that I think the only way that so, so that I think the only way that gets done is if we start identifying gets done is if we start identifying gets done is if we start identifying specifically what those pieces of data specifically what those pieces of data specifically what those pieces of data are that we that that consumers have to are that we that that consumers have to are that we that that consumers have to have and then we have to start having have and then we have to start having have and then we have to start having that conversation about how we get that that conversation about how we get that that conversation about how we get that get that done and start requiring get that done and start requiring get that done and start requiring there's a question. Um, I'm glad that you brought up what Um, I'm glad that you brought up what Um, I'm glad that you brought up what you just brought up. So, we're part we you just brought up. So, we're part we you just brought up. So, we're part we are the um the content team in Cisco are the um the content team in Cisco are the um the content team in Cisco PERT. So we edit, publish and maintain PERT. So we edit, publish and maintain PERT. So we edit, publish and maintain the security advisories and we put a lot the security advisories and we put a lot the security advisories and we put a lot of effort into our summaries and our of effort into our summaries and our of effort into our summaries and our descriptions. So I was going to actually descriptions. So I was going to actually descriptions. So I was going to actually ask about the importance of the words in ask about the importance of the words in ask about the importance of the words in addition to the data and do you see a addition to the data and do you see a addition to the data and do you see a big variance in what um submitters give big variance in what um submitters give big variance in what um submitters give you? Oh yeah. And is there you know do you? Oh yeah. And is there you know do you? Oh yeah. And is there you know do you have people who are like here's one you have people who are like here's one you have people who are like here's one sentence this is a doss or then you have sentence this is a doss or then you have sentence this is a doss or then you have like we give you like a two paragraph like we give you like a two paragraph like we give you like a two paragraph description of it and um is somewhere in description of it and um is somewhere in description of it and um is somewhere in the middle where we want to be or is it the middle where we want to be or is it the middle where we want to be or is it should everybody be providing a lot more should everybody be providing a lot more should everybody be providing a lot more words or you know pretty much you can words or you know pretty much you can words or you know pretty much you can you can provide because it's the format you can provide because it's the format you can provide because it's the format actually supports multip you have the actually supports multip you have the actually supports multip you have the description there's like the mitigation description there's like the mitigation description there's like the mitigation section all the you can do lots of section all the you can do lots of section all the you can do lots of sections we have some CNAs who basically sections we have some CNAs who basically sections we have some CNAs who basically reproduce their entire advisory in the reproduce their entire advisory in the reproduce their entire advisory in the CBE CBE CBE which which is which is fine. You have which which is which is fine. You have which which is which is fine. You have others you basically will have like read others you basically will have like read others you basically will have like read our advisory you know like just nothing our advisory you know like just nothing our advisory you know like just nothing nothing more right now I think what what nothing more right now I think what what nothing more right now I think what what is the description validation has to be is the description validation has to be is the description validation has to be like like five characters to 124 or like like five characters to 124 or like like five characters to 124 or something 1024 or something like that I something 1024 or something like that I something 1024 or something like that I think it only has to be a single think it only has to be a single think it only has to be a single character if I remember yeah it's not character if I remember yeah it's not character if I remember yeah it's not very like it just has to be a very like it just has to be a very like it just has to be a description um and it's hard to validate description um and it's hard to validate description um and it's hard to validate that right because it's human readable that right because it's human readable that right because it's human readable text like you could just put in Laura text like you could just put in Laura text like you could just put in Laura Ipsum over and over again and it would Ipsum over and over again and it would Ipsum over and over again and it would satisfy a length check so you know how satisfy a length check so you know how satisfy a length check so you know how do you validate that you know obviously do you validate that you know obviously do you validate that you know obviously we're not going to have humans in the we're not going to have humans in the we're not going to have humans in the loop validating every CVE. Uh so other loop validating every CVE. Uh so other loop validating every CVE. Uh so other than feedback and peer pressure I know than feedback and peer pressure I know than feedback and peer pressure I know like F5 as a CNA we copy our des we what like F5 as a CNA we copy our des we what like F5 as a CNA we copy our des we what our description field that's in our our description field that's in our our description field that's in our security advisory we have a description security advisory we have a description security advisory we have a description that is copied verbatim into our CV. Uh that is copied verbatim into our CV. Uh that is copied verbatim into our CV. Uh so that's what that's what we provide as so that's what that's what we provide as so that's what that's what we provide as far as CV goes. We provide that far as CV goes. We provide that far as CV goes. We provide that description block. Um and so it's description block. Um and so it's description block. Um and so it's different CNAs on different approaches. different CNAs on different approaches. different CNAs on different approaches. Uh, and we I don't think there's ever Uh, and we I don't think there's ever Uh, and we I don't think there's ever going to be one thing that satisfies going to be one thing that satisfies going to be one thing that satisfies everybody. There are some arguments everybody. There are some arguments everybody. There are some arguments people like, I want to see everything people like, I want to see everything people like, I want to see everything including the version numbers and the including the version numbers and the including the version numbers and the product names and everything in the product names and everything in the product names and everything in the description. We generally don't do that description. We generally don't do that description. We generally don't do that as a CNA because we have because that as a CNA because we have because that as a CNA because we have because that you end up especially multiple products, you end up especially multiple products, you end up especially multiple products, multiple versions, you end up with a multiple versions, you end up with a multiple versions, you end up with a very long rambling description that just very long rambling description that just very long rambling description that just talks about version numbers and product talks about version numbers and product talks about version numbers and product names. So it it uh there's nothing one names. So it it uh there's nothing one names. So it it uh there's nothing one approach of things to make everybody approach of things to make everybody approach of things to make everybody happy. But I think detail more details happy. But I think detail more details happy. But I think detail more details at some degree is better. at some degree is better. at some degree is better. Yeah. Uh quick question regarding ADPs. Uh Uh quick question regarding ADPs. Uh Uh quick question regarding ADPs. Uh will you stop publishing security will you stop publishing security will you stop publishing security advisories when you're an ADP or do you advisories when you're an ADP or do you advisories when you're an ADP or do you expect that as an outcome? expect that as an outcome? expect that as an outcome? When someone's an What do you mean about When someone's an What do you mean about When someone's an What do you mean about being an ADP? So if somebody is an ADP, being an ADP? So if somebody is an ADP, being an ADP? So if somebody is an ADP, do you expect that then they stop do you expect that then they stop do you expect that then they stop publishing security advisories or would publishing security advisories or would publishing security advisories or would that be? Oh no, we would never do that that be? Oh no, we would never do that that be? Oh no, we would never do that as if we even if we if CFI become ADP, as if we even if we if CFI become ADP, as if we even if we if CFI become ADP, you would still publish it on our you would still publish it on our you would still publish it on our site because that's like we're a CNA but site because that's like we're a CNA but site because that's like we're a CNA but we still publish security advisories we still publish security advisories we still publish security advisories even though we publish a CVE. So think even though we publish a CVE. So think even though we publish a CVE. So think of uh if if the if we could start things of uh if if the if we could start things of uh if if the if we could start things all over with CVE and NVD, NVD enriches all over with CVE and NVD, NVD enriches all over with CVE and NVD, NVD enriches records, right? They don't create new records, right? They don't create new records, right? They don't create new advisories. So there are going to be advisories. So there are going to be advisories. So there are going to be roles I think as an ADP and that was roles I think as an ADP and that was roles I think as an ADP and that was envisioned originally. Yeah. That some envisioned originally. Yeah. That some envisioned originally. Yeah. That some ADPs will just provide enriched data for ADPs will just provide enriched data for ADPs will just provide enriched data for records that already exist not records that already exist not records that already exist not publishing their own. Does that make publishing their own. Does that make publishing their own. Does that make sense? So we wouldn't expect an ADP to sense? So we wouldn't expect an ADP to sense? So we wouldn't expect an ADP to to to do have their own security to to do have their own security to to do have their own security advisories. Well, it depends on type of advisories. Well, it depends on type of advisories. Well, it depends on type of ADP, I guess. Like if you're talking ADP, I guess. Like if you're talking ADP, I guess. Like if you're talking about if you're talking about a CNA about if you're talking about a CNA about if you're talking about a CNA who's also an ADP or vendor ADP, yeah, who's also an ADP or vendor ADP, yeah, who's also an ADP or vendor ADP, yeah, they're probably going to keep they're probably going to keep they're probably going to keep publishing. I don't know of a single CNA publishing. I don't know of a single CNA publishing. I don't know of a single CNA who doesn't publish security advisories who doesn't publish security advisories who doesn't publish security advisories without just because you publish a CV without just because you publish a CV without just because you publish a CV record doesn't mean you don't put it on record doesn't mean you don't put it on record doesn't mean you don't put it on your own website. Yes. So my question is actually follow Yes. So my question is actually follow Yes. So my question is actually follow up to this. Are there conversations up to this. Are there conversations up to this. Are there conversations about including CNA's vex documents as about including CNA's vex documents as about including CNA's vex documents as part of the CV CV record? way far off topic from the I just know way far off topic from the I just know way far off topic from the I just know that like it's break time and everything that like it's break time and everything that like it's break time and everything and if you guys want to continue to and if you guys want to continue to and if you guys want to continue to discuss that we'll take one more discuss that we'll take one more discuss that we'll take one more question can you ask it again are there question can you ask it again are there question can you ask it again are there conversations about including CNA's vex conversations about including CNA's vex conversations about including CNA's vex documents as part of the CV record so I don't think we've had conversations so I don't think we've had conversations so I don't think we've had conversations about including VEX no data but there is about including VEX no data but there is about including VEX no data but there is I think um a way to get some of that I think um a way to get some of that I think um a way to get some of that product information and Maybe that could product information and Maybe that could product information and Maybe that could be consumed by Yeah, I have never I have be consumed by Yeah, I have never I have be consumed by Yeah, I have never I have not yet heard anybody talking about any not yet heard anybody talking about any not yet heard anybody talking about any combination of CVE records and VEX. combination of CVE records and VEX. combination of CVE records and VEX. Yeah, any merging there. Um I mean CVS Yeah, any merging there. Um I mean CVS Yeah, any merging there. Um I mean CVS are often referenced in VEX documents, are often referenced in VEX documents, are often referenced in VEX documents, but it tends to be that direction where but it tends to be that direction where but it tends to be that direction where VEX might say this product is affected VEX might say this product is affected VEX might say this product is affected by this CVE. Here's a link to a CV by this CVE. Here's a link to a CV by this CVE. Here's a link to a CV record, but I don't I mean you could add record, but I don't I mean you could add record, but I don't I mean you could add it as a reference I suppose because you it as a reference I suppose because you it as a reference I suppose because you could have a reference field if you're could have a reference field if you're could have a reference field if you're like a CNA or this or or if any some like a CNA or this or or if any some like a CNA or this or or if any some ADPs you could add reference links. So, ADPs you could add reference links. So, ADPs you could add reference links. So, this is a reference for information. I this is a reference for information. I this is a reference for information. I suppose you could link to a VEX suppose you could link to a VEX suppose you could link to a VEX document, too. Yeah. I I think I did document, too. Yeah. I I think I did document, too. Yeah. I I think I did have a conversation with somebody about have a conversation with somebody about have a conversation with somebody about the fact that there'll be more product the fact that there'll be more product the fact that there'll be more product information, potentially affected information, potentially affected information, potentially affected products. Yeah. In the VEX, which could products. Yeah. In the VEX, which could products. Yeah. In the VEX, which could if we could find a way to suck that back if we could find a way to suck that back if we could find a way to suck that back into the CVE record, that might be very into the CVE record, that might be very into the CVE record, that might be very useful. Okay, one more. useful. Okay, one more. useful. Okay, one more. Take it off line to Discord. Take it off line to Discord. Take it off line to Discord. Sure. Sure. Sure. Thank you. I have even more questions Thank you. I have even more questions Thank you. I have even more questions about ADPs. This is a big topic for me. about ADPs. This is a big topic for me. about ADPs. This is a big topic for me. Um, so as a follow-up to my last Um, so as a follow-up to my last Um, so as a follow-up to my last question about allowing others to become question about allowing others to become question about allowing others to become ADPs, will ADP records then need to be ADPs, will ADP records then need to be ADPs, will ADP records then need to be validated by the original CNA or perhaps validated by the original CNA or perhaps validated by the original CNA or perhaps even other ADPs or there was there was even other ADPs or there was there was even other ADPs or there was there was never intention to have validation. So never intention to have validation. So never intention to have validation. So So the CNA owns the original record, but So the CNA owns the original record, but So the CNA owns the original record, but the ADPs are adding additional the ADPs are adding additional the ADPs are adding additional information. Now could we have some sort information. Now could we have some sort information. Now could we have some sort of maturity level rating system that's of maturity level rating system that's of maturity level rating system that's been discussed maybe yeah but like some been discussed maybe yeah but like some been discussed maybe yeah but like some kind of feedback but yeah the way kind of feedback but yeah the way kind of feedback but yeah the way because the way it's set up with the because the way it's set up with the because the way it's set up with the different containers in the record it's different containers in the record it's different containers in the record it's like you are responsible for your like you are responsible for your like you are responsible for your container and so if you're an ADP you're container and so if you're an ADP you're container and so if you're an ADP you're given is given a scope uh if you exceed given is given a scope uh if you exceed given is given a scope uh if you exceed your scope you get tall talk to and if your scope you get tall talk to and if your scope you get tall talk to and if you keep doing it you get removed um and you keep doing it you get removed um and you keep doing it you get removed um and so if you're approved to do something so if you're approved to do something so if you're approved to do something you're approved to do that and like the you're approved to do that and like the you're approved to do that and like the CNA can't say hey I don't like this CNA can't say hey I don't like this CNA can't say hey I don't like this person like I don't like SISA adding RN person like I don't like SISA adding RN person like I don't like SISA adding RN Richmond stuff to my record. You don't Richmond stuff to my record. You don't Richmond stuff to my record. You don't get a voice. get a voice. get a voice. You absolutely do not as a CNA have a You absolutely do not as a CNA have a You absolutely do not as a CNA have a voice in that. It is part of the voice in that. It is part of the voice in that. It is part of the program. They are an ADP. If you don't program. They are an ADP. If you don't program. They are an ADP. If you don't like what they're doing, you can put like what they're doing, you can put like what they're doing, you can put something in your part of the record something in your part of the record something in your part of the record that disagrees with them, but you can't that disagrees with them, but you can't that disagrees with them, but you can't stop them. Uh, interesting. And same stop them. Uh, interesting. And same stop them. Uh, interesting. And same thing for one ADP can't stop another thing for one ADP can't stop another thing for one ADP can't stop another ADP. That is just the way the program is ADP. That is just the way the program is ADP. That is just the way the program is set up, and I don't see that changing. set up, and I don't see that changing. set up, and I don't see that changing. And one last thing, will the 5.1 And one last thing, will the 5.1 And one last thing, will the 5.1 standard uh be able to be extended to standard uh be able to be extended to standard uh be able to be extended to old records? So ADPs could go back and old records? So ADPs could go back and old records? So ADPs could go back and slowly correct old records. Well, well, slowly correct old records. Well, well, slowly correct old records. Well, well, all everything five ADP was introduced all everything five ADP was introduced all everything five ADP was introduced in the 50. Okay. Was in the 50. Okay. Was in the 50. Okay. Was 5.1.0 was it? No, it was No, it was 5.1.0 was it? No, it was No, it was 5.1.0 was it? No, it was No, it was before that. I'm sorry. It was like 5. I before that. I'm sorry. It was like 5. I before that. I'm sorry. It was like 5. I think ADP has been there since we went think ADP has been there since we went think ADP has been there since we went to five. It just started getting used to five. It just started getting used to five. It just started getting used when 5.1 came out. when 5.1 came out. when 5.1 came out. All 40 records have been migrated to All 40 records have been migrated to All 40 records have been migrated to five. So technically, it should be five. So technically, it should be five. So technically, it should be anything that exists in this corpus anything that exists in this corpus anything that exists in this corpus right now has a five version. right now has a five version. right now has a five version. Um, so I I think any ADP, like if CISA Um, so I I think any ADP, like if CISA Um, so I I think any ADP, like if CISA wanted to go back and enhance all wanted to go back and enhance all wanted to go back and enhance all existing CVEs, they could. I don't think existing CVEs, they could. I don't think existing CVEs, they could. I don't think they're going to, but I think they they're going to, but I think they they're going to, but I think they could. Yeah. I just wonder as more ADPs could. Yeah. I just wonder as more ADPs could. Yeah. I just wonder as more ADPs come online and they have a vested come online and they have a vested come online and they have a vested interest in correcting the records, they interest in correcting the records, they interest in correcting the records, they might start going back and fixing might start going back and fixing might start going back and fixing everything up. Yeah. And there are and everything up. Yeah. And there are and everything up. Yeah. And there are and there are plenty of CVs out there that there are plenty of CVs out there that there are plenty of CVs out there that are say from dead vendors or dead are say from dead vendors or dead are say from dead vendors or dead projects or just dead products that projects or just dead products that projects or just dead products that maybe there's new information that came maybe there's new information that came maybe there's new information that came out you know that so this the record was out you know that so this the record was out you know that so this the record was published in 2006 or something and uh published in 2006 or something and uh published in 2006 or something and uh you know the an ADP might be able to you know the an ADP might be able to you know the an ADP might be able to update that record to show how it's update that record to show how it's update that record to show how it's affecting things today. Thank you. Give a hand to Chris and Megazone for Give a hand to Chris and Megazone for Give a hand to Chris and Megazone for the presentation.
