Um Jay and more, so we're looking good. Um Jay and I, we have half an hour. We're going to I, we have half an hour. We're going to I, we have half an hour. We're going to try to get through our stuff. Um if you try to get through our stuff. Um if you try to get through our stuff. Um if you have questions, we don't mind you have questions, we don't mind you have questions, we don't mind you raising your hand or asking during. We raising your hand or asking during. We raising your hand or asking during. We might, you know, keep it short just to might, you know, keep it short just to might, you know, keep it short just to get through the material. Um so yeah, get through the material. Um so yeah, get through the material. Um so yeah, this is uh the minimum viable this is uh the minimum viable this is uh the minimum viable vulnerability enumeration. Thank vulnerability enumeration. Thank vulnerability enumeration. Thank goodness there's an easy acronym uh goodness there's an easy acronym uh goodness there's an easy acronym uh MVVE. Oh, where's that thing? Right. MVVE. Oh, where's that thing? Right. MVVE. Oh, where's that thing? Right. So um in the fall we were in Utrect. So um in the fall we were in Utrect. So um in the fall we were in Utrect. Yep. at uh a different awesome Yep. at uh a different awesome Yep. at uh a different awesome vulnerability related conference, even vulnerability related conference, even vulnerability related conference, even more narrowly nerdy than this one. Uh more narrowly nerdy than this one. Uh more narrowly nerdy than this one. Uh Vorecast TC. And this is a tunnel Vorecast TC. And this is a tunnel Vorecast TC. And this is a tunnel underneath a canal, near a canal. It was underneath a canal, near a canal. It was underneath a canal, near a canal. It was a beautifully decorated tunnel. Yeah. a beautifully decorated tunnel. Yeah. a beautifully decorated tunnel. Yeah. And there's Jay. I took a picture to And there's Jay. I took a picture to And there's Jay. I took a picture to just remember the moment, not really just remember the moment, not really just remember the moment, not really knowing that caring Jay was there. But knowing that caring Jay was there. But knowing that caring Jay was there. But luckily, uh Jay was there and I went up luckily, uh Jay was there and I went up luckily, uh Jay was there and I went up and said, "Hey, Jay, what if?" Um, and and said, "Hey, Jay, what if?" Um, and and said, "Hey, Jay, what if?" Um, and then that's sort of where we talk a then that's sort of where we talk a then that's sort of where we talk a couple times a year and that's where couple times a year and that's where couple times a year and that's where things got sort of got started here. So, things got sort of got started here. So, things got sort of got started here. So, and so this is basically since this this and so this is basically since this this and so this is basically since this this was what in the fall? Yeah. Uh, was what in the fall? Yeah. Uh, was what in the fall? Yeah. Uh, September, October. Anyway, so shortly September, October. Anyway, so shortly September, October. Anyway, so shortly after that, Art and I started setting up after that, Art and I started setting up after that, Art and I started setting up meetings to talk about this question and meetings to talk about this question and meetings to talk about this question and we've been meeting quite often and it's we've been meeting quite often and it's we've been meeting quite often and it's been one of the more enjoyable long been one of the more enjoyable long been one of the more enjoyable long extended discussions uh that I've had. extended discussions uh that I've had. extended discussions uh that I've had. It's been very fun. It has. It's been very fun. It has. It's been very fun. It has. So the the question that Art asked me, So the the question that Art asked me, So the the question that Art asked me, we were sitting there, it says, "What we were sitting there, it says, "What we were sitting there, it says, "What information do we need in a information do we need in a information do we need in a vulnerability record to uni uniquely vulnerability record to uni uniquely vulnerability record to uni uniquely identify a identify a identify a vulnerability?" And uh both Art and I do vulnerability?" And uh both Art and I do vulnerability?" And uh both Art and I do a lot of work with a lot of work with a lot of work with CV.org and we were discussing this CV.org and we were discussing this CV.org and we were discussing this trying to figure out what is the minimum trying to figure out what is the minimum trying to figure out what is the minimum that you would need what is that core that you would need what is that core that you would need what is that core element and there are a lot of databases element and there are a lot of databases element and there are a lot of databases popping up. We've got, you know, OSV popping up. We've got, you know, OSV popping up. We've got, you know, OSV now, GitHub Security Advisories. Ana is now, GitHub Security Advisories. Ana is now, GitHub Security Advisories. Ana is talking about one, JPERT, the Canadian, talking about one, JPERT, the Canadian, talking about one, JPERT, the Canadian, the um Chinese NVD. Um there's a lot of the um Chinese NVD. Um there's a lot of the um Chinese NVD. Um there's a lot of different databases. And what would the different databases. And what would the different databases. And what would the minimum core be that all of those should minimum core be that all of those should minimum core be that all of those should share? How do we define those? How do we share? How do we define those? How do we share? How do we define those? How do we talk about talk about talk about those? So, um and we as we talked, we those? So, um and we as we talked, we those? So, um and we as we talked, we really really focused on the absolute really really focused on the absolute really really focused on the absolute absolute minimum. So, keep that in mind absolute minimum. So, keep that in mind absolute minimum. So, keep that in mind as we go through things. Um and real as we go through things. Um and real as we go through things. Um and real quickly just a aside our interest in quickly just a aside our interest in quickly just a aside our interest in what are the minimum parts of a database what are the minimum parts of a database what are the minimum parts of a database turned out that's what we started off turned out that's what we started off turned out that's what we started off with but we had to sort of talk about with but we had to sort of talk about with but we had to sort of talk about why we want that information in the why we want that information in the why we want that information in the first place. So this got into a first place. So this got into a first place. So this got into a discussion about vulner vulnerability discussion about vulner vulnerability discussion about vulner vulnerability management and I don't think anyone here management and I don't think anyone here management and I don't think anyone here will be too surprised by this but just a will be too surprised by this but just a will be too surprised by this but just a reminder this is sort of risk management reminder this is sort of risk management reminder this is sort of risk management doesn't have to be a big scary doesn't have to be a big scary doesn't have to be a big scary multi-year effort with 30 people working multi-year effort with 30 people working multi-year effort with 30 people working on it but right you have a vulnerability on it but right you have a vulnerability on it but right you have a vulnerability you really are effectively in the end you really are effectively in the end you really are effectively in the end trying to sort of manage your risk. trying to sort of manage your risk. trying to sort of manage your risk. We're not going to have zero We're not going to have zero We're not going to have zero vulnerabilities. There's going to be vulnerabilities. There's going to be vulnerabilities. There's going to be some number of them may not even fix some number of them may not even fix some number of them may not even fix them all the same way. We all have to them all the same way. We all have to them all the same way. We all have to deal with which ones do we do first, deal with which ones do we do first, deal with which ones do we do first, second, third. That's a different second, third. That's a different second, third. That's a different question or different answer for for question or different answer for for question or different answer for for different people quite possibly. different people quite possibly. different people quite possibly. Y so um Jay mentioned that there's a lot Y so um Jay mentioned that there's a lot Y so um Jay mentioned that there's a lot of databases and a lot of stuff. Uh this of databases and a lot of stuff. Uh this of databases and a lot of stuff. Uh this is a slightly scientific and slightly is a slightly scientific and slightly is a slightly scientific and slightly artisally crafted um very statistically artisally crafted um very statistically artisally crafted um very statistically valid though. Uh word cloud tag cloud of valid though. Uh word cloud tag cloud of valid though. Uh word cloud tag cloud of um a bunch of Oh yeah. I mean I I um a bunch of Oh yeah. I mean I I um a bunch of Oh yeah. I mean I I grabbed if you had a JSON schema and my grabbed if you had a JSON schema and my grabbed if you had a JSON schema and my jq command worked your words got in jq command worked your words got in jq command worked your words got in here. Um, so this is the stuff we all here. Um, so this is the stuff we all here. Um, so this is the stuff we all deal with, right? Just to clarify, I do deal with, right? Just to clarify, I do deal with, right? Just to clarify, I do a lot of data data visualization, but a lot of data data visualization, but a lot of data data visualization, but Art created this. I just wanted to get Art created this. I just wanted to get Art created this. I just wanted to get that out there. If you see an easy thing that out there. If you see an easy thing that out there. If you see an easy thing you could do on a website, I did it. If you could do on a website, I did it. If you could do on a website, I did it. If you see a complicated thing, it's you see a complicated thing, it's you see a complicated thing, it's probably probably from J. Um, but yeah, probably probably from J. Um, but yeah, probably probably from J. Um, but yeah, we know this, right? There's a ton of we know this, right? There's a ton of we know this, right? There's a ton of stuff, and this is like a hundred of the stuff, and this is like a hundred of the stuff, and this is like a hundred of the 400 words, right, that made the top top 400 words, right, that made the top top 400 words, right, that made the top top cut or whatever. Um, do we need all cut or whatever. Um, do we need all cut or whatever. Um, do we need all these things? Do we use all of them? Do these things? Do we use all of them? Do these things? Do we use all of them? Do we care? Are they helping us? Do they we care? Are they helping us? Do they we care? Are they helping us? Do they cost a lot to obtain the information and cost a lot to obtain the information and cost a lot to obtain the information and then is it giving us any benefit in the then is it giving us any benefit in the then is it giving us any benefit in the end? I don't know. But that's what we end? I don't know. But that's what we end? I don't know. But that's what we tried to look at here. Um, also a quick tried to look at here. Um, also a quick tried to look at here. Um, also a quick nod. Um, we borrowed our title slightly nod. Um, we borrowed our title slightly nod. Um, we borrowed our title slightly from this uh seminal paper from 1999. I from this uh seminal paper from 1999. I from this uh seminal paper from 1999. I think CV is now think CV is now think CV is now 26 years old. Um, and I put this up here 26 years old. Um, and I put this up here 26 years old. Um, and I put this up here for one reason, you know, credit where for one reason, you know, credit where for one reason, you know, credit where credit is due. But also um this back in credit is due. But also um this back in credit is due. But also um this back in even the early days what goes in the even the early days what goes in the even the early days what goes in the database was obviously a big question. database was obviously a big question. database was obviously a big question. Um and a lot of stuff in this paper is Um and a lot of stuff in this paper is Um and a lot of stuff in this paper is still valid. We might be doing some of still valid. We might be doing some of still valid. We might be doing some of it. We might not be doing some of it. We it. We might not be doing some of it. We it. We might not be doing some of it. We might maybe we should be doing more of might maybe we should be doing more of might maybe we should be doing more of it. Um but if you haven't read this it. Um but if you haven't read this it. Um but if you haven't read this paper, it's pretty short. And if you're paper, it's pretty short. And if you're paper, it's pretty short. And if you're in CVE at all, it's worth uh certainly in CVE at all, it's worth uh certainly in CVE at all, it's worth uh certainly worth the read. Yep. So let's talk about worth the read. Yep. So let's talk about worth the read. Yep. So let's talk about how we set up to define MVVE. that very how we set up to define MVVE. that very how we set up to define MVVE. that very easy acronym to say. So we the first and easy acronym to say. So we the first and easy acronym to say. So we the first and very core element of MVVE is that it very core element of MVVE is that it very core element of MVVE is that it must contain unique and public must contain unique and public must contain unique and public identifier for each record. And we had a identifier for each record. And we had a identifier for each record. And we had a debate about the the concept of a debate about the the concept of a debate about the the concept of a primary versus secondary type database. primary versus secondary type database. primary versus secondary type database. So if you're primary like cv.org, you're So if you're primary like cv.org, you're So if you're primary like cv.org, you're going to need a CVE ID. You need that going to need a CVE ID. You need that going to need a CVE ID. You need that public identifier. But if you're just public identifier. But if you're just public identifier. But if you're just there to enrich, if you're a secondary there to enrich, if you're a secondary there to enrich, if you're a secondary source like like EPSS always publishes source like like EPSS always publishes source like like EPSS always publishes the scores with a CV ID, they don't have the scores with a CV ID, they don't have the scores with a CV ID, they don't have their own unique ID. They're a secondary their own unique ID. They're a secondary their own unique ID. They're a secondary source going to enrich some other source going to enrich some other source going to enrich some other primary unique primary unique primary unique ID. The second one must contain, this is ID. The second one must contain, this is ID. The second one must contain, this is a really key one, must contain enough a really key one, must contain enough a really key one, must contain enough information to initiate the information to initiate the information to initiate the vulnerability management process for the vulnerability management process for the vulnerability management process for the product consumer. and we spent quite a product consumer. and we spent quite a product consumer. and we spent quite a bit of time talking about terms and bit of time talking about terms and bit of time talking about terms and definitions and all of those fun definitions and all of those fun definitions and all of those fun debates. Um yeah, and so this um that debates. Um yeah, and so this um that debates. Um yeah, and so this um that that's a key one for me, but you want to that's a key one for me, but you want to that's a key one for me, but you want to take Yeah, sure. Um so we practiced a take Yeah, sure. Um so we practiced a take Yeah, sure. Um so we practiced a lot our handoffs. You can you'll be able lot our handoffs. You can you'll be able lot our handoffs. You can you'll be able to tell. Um yeah. Um I need to to tell. Um yeah. Um I need to to tell. Um yeah. Um I need to disambiguate these things, right? I need disambiguate these things, right? I need disambiguate these things, right? I need to tell them apart. So to tell them apart. So to tell them apart. So there's there will always be sort of a there's there will always be sort of a there's there will always be sort of a conflict or a confusion here and there conflict or a confusion here and there conflict or a confusion here and there but you know sufficiently unique but you know sufficiently unique but you know sufficiently unique disambiguate disentangle is it this disambiguate disentangle is it this disambiguate disentangle is it this vulnerability or that one or that one or vulnerability or that one or that one or vulnerability or that one or that one or that one. Even if you're doing somehow a that one. Even if you're doing somehow a that one. Even if you're doing somehow a perfect job of that we all might perfect job of that we all might perfect job of that we all might disagree on what is a vulnerability and disagree on what is a vulnerability and disagree on what is a vulnerability and what is three vulnerabilities. So we what is three vulnerabilities. So we what is three vulnerabilities. So we didn't solve the definitional problem didn't solve the definitional problem didn't solve the definitional problem but for the purposes of this you've got but for the purposes of this you've got but for the purposes of this you've got to have enough information to tell to have enough information to tell to have enough information to tell things apart um pretty reasonably uh and things apart um pretty reasonably uh and things apart um pretty reasonably uh and distinctly. And just to expand on that, distinctly. And just to expand on that, distinctly. And just to expand on that, if you create a vulnerability record and if you create a vulnerability record and if you create a vulnerability record and all you have is an ID and and a product all you have is an ID and and a product all you have is an ID and and a product producer has a product and they say, producer has a product and they say, producer has a product and they say, "Hey, this product here, we've got a CVE "Hey, this product here, we've got a CVE "Hey, this product here, we've got a CVE for it. Got a vulnerability identified. for it. Got a vulnerability identified. for it. Got a vulnerability identified. Uh, here it is. Go fix it." You know, Uh, here it is. Go fix it." You know, Uh, here it is. Go fix it." You know, like the information that you could have like the information that you could have like the information that you could have in there would be rather minimal. And in there would be rather minimal. And in there would be rather minimal. And maybe you don't have to do this third maybe you don't have to do this third maybe you don't have to do this third one, right? you maybe you don't need to one, right? you maybe you don't need to one, right? you maybe you don't need to if you just know I got this product I if you just know I got this product I if you just know I got this product I need to go fix it maybe you don't need need to go fix it maybe you don't need need to go fix it maybe you don't need to disamiguate from other to disamiguate from other to disamiguate from other vulnerabilities you know in the same vulnerabilities you know in the same vulnerabilities you know in the same product especially but I think that this product especially but I think that this product especially but I think that this is a key one for us um sort of the is a key one for us um sort of the is a key one for us um sort of the inverse of this is you know our test is inverse of this is you know our test is inverse of this is you know our test is if I remove one of the elements does the if I remove one of the elements does the if I remove one of the elements does the thing fall apart and no longer exists so thing fall apart and no longer exists so thing fall apart and no longer exists so removal of any one of the minimum removal of any one of the minimum removal of any one of the minimum elements means I I fail I don't have a elements means I I fail I don't have a elements means I I fail I don't have a record anymore I can't do any of the record anymore I can't do any of the record anymore I can't do any of the stuff I needed to do yeah minimum stuff I needed to do yeah minimum stuff I needed to do yeah minimum minimum um We'd like to be uh is this minimum um We'd like to be uh is this minimum um We'd like to be uh is this the is efficient the right word here? the is efficient the right word here? the is efficient the right word here? Not not replicate the storage, not have Not not replicate the storage, not have Not not replicate the storage, not have the multiple copies of things. the multiple copies of things. the multiple copies of things. Parimonious. Par sure data science the Parimonious. Par sure data science the Parimonious. Par sure data science the data science term parsimonious. Um how data science term parsimonious. Um how data science term parsimonious. Um how many how many ways should a record many how many ways should a record many how many ways should a record represent what's affected or not represent what's affected or not represent what's affected or not affected? Three or four. We could do affected? Three or four. We could do affected? Three or four. We could do that, but one would be better, right? that, but one would be better, right? that, but one would be better, right? Uh so do you mind if I this one? I think Uh so do you mind if I this one? I think Uh so do you mind if I this one? I think I fixed this one up last so it's good. I fixed this one up last so it's good. I fixed this one up last so it's good. We just started thinking what are the We just started thinking what are the We just started thinking what are the minimum elements that's all we wanted to minimum elements that's all we wanted to minimum elements that's all we wanted to talk about very quickly we had to talk talk about very quickly we had to talk talk about very quickly we had to talk about everything else around them which about everything else around them which about everything else around them which is which is fair one day I think I said is which is fair one day I think I said is which is fair one day I think I said to Jay man we're spending all our time to Jay man we're spending all our time to Jay man we're spending all our time stuck in these other parts of the stuck in these other parts of the stuck in these other parts of the problem and I felt like we were doing a problem and I felt like we were doing a problem and I felt like we were doing a bad job and Jay said um no that shows bad job and Jay said um no that shows bad job and Jay said um no that shows that the information we're picking has that the information we're picking has that the information we're picking has to fulfill some need and has to fit into to fulfill some need and has to fit into to fulfill some need and has to fit into something else so fitting in is actually something else so fitting in is actually something else so fitting in is actually a pretty pretty key part of our our work a pretty pretty key part of our our work a pretty pretty key part of our our work here. here. here. We really wanted information elements. We really wanted information elements. We really wanted information elements. We quickly realized we were getting we We quickly realized we were getting we We quickly realized we were getting we were trying to find out what they were were trying to find out what they were were trying to find out what they were for the purposes of doing vulnerability for the purposes of doing vulnerability for the purposes of doing vulnerability management. We decided we needed some management. We decided we needed some management. We decided we needed some phases of vulnerability management and a phases of vulnerability management and a phases of vulnerability management and a few stakeholder few stakeholder few stakeholder roles. Again, we the focus is the roles. Again, we the focus is the roles. Again, we the focus is the information elements. We couldn't avoid information elements. We couldn't avoid information elements. We couldn't avoid some of the framing and that's perfectly some of the framing and that's perfectly some of the framing and that's perfectly fine. Um the phases I felt are going to fine. Um the phases I felt are going to fine. Um the phases I felt are going to turn out to be kind of more important to turn out to be kind of more important to turn out to be kind of more important to our work. Yeah. The roles we took a our work. Yeah. The roles we took a our work. Yeah. The roles we took a pretty light touch. Yeah, definitely. pretty light touch. Yeah, definitely. pretty light touch. Yeah, definitely. Okay. Yeah. And the phases are like Art Okay. Yeah. And the phases are like Art Okay. Yeah. And the phases are like Art said where we spend a lot of our time. said where we spend a lot of our time. said where we spend a lot of our time. And if you I would do this often when I And if you I would do this often when I And if you I would do this often when I was doing presentations talking about was doing presentations talking about was doing presentations talking about vulnerabilities. I would go Google vulnerabilities. I would go Google vulnerabilities. I would go Google vulnerability life cycle and I would get vulnerability life cycle and I would get vulnerability life cycle and I would get the circle with arrows and maybe five the circle with arrows and maybe five the circle with arrows and maybe five things on there, you know, discover, things on there, you know, discover, things on there, you know, discover, prioritize, remediate, monitor, report, prioritize, remediate, monitor, report, prioritize, remediate, monitor, report, stuff like that. And you get some slight stuff like that. And you get some slight stuff like that. And you get some slight variations. And that's where I started variations. And that's where I started variations. And that's where I started this project and obviously expanded a this project and obviously expanded a this project and obviously expanded a little bit. and it's not a circle. Uh little bit. and it's not a circle. Uh little bit. and it's not a circle. Uh but basically we define these things and but basically we define these things and but basically we define these things and there's not a lot of surprise here. Um there's not a lot of surprise here. Um there's not a lot of surprise here. Um and the the key thing that I think is a and the the key thing that I think is a and the the key thing that I think is a pivot point is around four. Um where pivot point is around four. Um where pivot point is around four. Um where we're putting stuff we're the the gap we're putting stuff we're the the gap we're putting stuff we're the the gap between public disclosure and public between public disclosure and public between public disclosure and public discovery. And that's really where we're discovery. And that's really where we're discovery. And that's really where we're going to focus a lot of our time. going to focus a lot of our time. going to focus a lot of our time. There's two other things that we added There's two other things that we added There's two other things that we added in here that were sort of discovered in here that were sort of discovered in here that were sort of discovered through our discussion. One is number through our discussion. One is number through our discussion. One is number seven where essentially you may discover seven where essentially you may discover seven where essentially you may discover local instances. You may discover that local instances. You may discover that local instances. You may discover that you've got a product that is vulnerable, you've got a product that is vulnerable, you've got a product that is vulnerable, but then seven says, "Hey, this one but then seven says, "Hey, this one but then seven says, "Hey, this one needs special configuration or it needs needs special configuration or it needs needs special configuration or it needs this other thing installed, needs to be this other thing installed, needs to be this other thing installed, needs to be running on an ARM platform or whatever running on an ARM platform or whatever running on an ARM platform or whatever it is." There's something like that that it is." There's something like that that it is." There's something like that that local context is going to provide color. local context is going to provide color. local context is going to provide color. And I think as we get into the more and And I think as we get into the more and And I think as we get into the more and more prioritization becomes critical more prioritization becomes critical more prioritization becomes critical that seven is going to become a much that seven is going to become a much that seven is going to become a much bigger step. And then the other thing bigger step. And then the other thing bigger step. And then the other thing was step nine where we talked about was step nine where we talked about was step nine where we talked about communication coordination. If you're in communication coordination. If you're in communication coordination. If you're in a small place and you're discovering and a small place and you're discovering and a small place and you're discovering and remediating this doesn't exist. If remediating this doesn't exist. If remediating this doesn't exist. If you're in a large org, this is a very you're in a large org, this is a very you're in a large org, this is a very very large challenge. Once you identify very large challenge. Once you identify very large challenge. Once you identify it and you prioritize it, now you have it and you prioritize it, now you have it and you prioritize it, now you have to actually go find who is responsible to actually go find who is responsible to actually go find who is responsible and you have to communicate and and you have to communicate and and you have to communicate and coordinate that remediation effort. coordinate that remediation effort. coordinate that remediation effort. Yeah. And and to this number nine step Yeah. And and to this number nine step Yeah. And and to this number nine step is essentially at a larger org if is essentially at a larger org if is essentially at a larger org if someone is sort of has a first you know someone is sort of has a first you know someone is sort of has a first you know their day job is do the ball management their day job is do the ball management their day job is do the ball management they may have to communicate and task they may have to communicate and task they may have to communicate and task other parts to do stuff. That's that's other parts to do stuff. That's that's other parts to do stuff. That's that's what it means right? Y um also oh what it means right? Y um also oh what it means right? Y um also oh question sir to what in the Yeah. To question sir to what in the Yeah. To question sir to what in the Yeah. To what extent is this an idealized what extent is this an idealized what extent is this an idealized timeline versus an actual one? Exactly. timeline versus an actual one? Exactly. timeline versus an actual one? Exactly. Yes. Yes. Yes. Bingo. Yeah. No. Uh we could qualify it, Bingo. Yeah. No. Uh we could qualify it, Bingo. Yeah. No. Uh we could qualify it, I think. Yes. Not quantifying. Yeah. So, I think. Yes. Not quantifying. Yeah. So, I think. Yes. Not quantifying. Yeah. So, this is idealized and as Jay mentioned, this is idealized and as Jay mentioned, this is idealized and as Jay mentioned, you can search the internet and you can you can search the internet and you can you can search the internet and you can find any number of these. We're not find any number of these. We're not find any number of these. We're not arguing too much about is ours right or arguing too much about is ours right or arguing too much about is ours right or wrong. We needed something to fit in our wrong. We needed something to fit in our wrong. We needed something to fit in our part and see how how things and there part and see how how things and there part and see how how things and there there yeah we'll the next slide there yeah we'll the next slide there yeah we'll the next slide actually. Thank you for that. Um no more actually. Thank you for that. Um no more actually. Thank you for that. Um no more but but yeah I mean this is the reason but but yeah I mean this is the reason but but yeah I mean this is the reason that this exists is to evaluate that this exists is to evaluate that this exists is to evaluate information elements. If if we say hey information elements. If if we say hey information elements. If if we say hey we really need this thing we need to say we really need this thing we need to say we really need this thing we need to say we need this thing because of the tasks we need this thing because of the tasks we need this thing because of the tasks in phase eight right that's why we need in phase eight right that's why we need in phase eight right that's why we need to do it. So in theory, all that to do it. So in theory, all that to do it. So in theory, all that information on that stupid word cloud information on that stupid word cloud information on that stupid word cloud should help you with one of these phases should help you with one of these phases should help you with one of these phases somewhere. That's where kind of where somewhere. That's where kind of where somewhere. That's where kind of where things are coming in. Um yes, this is things are coming in. Um yes, this is things are coming in. Um yes, this is idealized and this this linear if you idealized and this this linear if you idealized and this this linear if you did actually 1 through, you know, 1 did actually 1 through, you know, 1 did actually 1 through, you know, 1 through 11, 0 through 11, this would through 11, 0 through 11, this would through 11, 0 through 11, this would maybe be the ideal sort of somebody maybe be the ideal sort of somebody maybe be the ideal sort of somebody finds something, they report it to a finds something, they report it to a finds something, they report it to a coordinator or the vendor directly, coordinator or the vendor directly, coordinator or the vendor directly, there's a nice private coordination there's a nice private coordination there's a nice private coordination period, the disclosure is all planned. period, the disclosure is all planned. period, the disclosure is all planned. So my version, my term is um risk So my version, my term is um risk So my version, my term is um risk minimizing defensive coordinated minimizing defensive coordinated minimizing defensive coordinated vulnerability disclosure. Is this vulnerability disclosure. Is this vulnerability disclosure. Is this idealized plot if you're on the side of idealized plot if you're on the side of idealized plot if you're on the side of defense? defense? defense? Are you looking Pete Aller asking a Are you looking Pete Aller asking a Are you looking Pete Aller asking a question here? Are you looking to make question here? Are you looking to make question here? Are you looking to make this standardized then? Is I don't this standardized then? Is I don't this standardized then? Is I don't because there's there's because there's there's because there's there's there's so many permutations which are I there's so many permutations which are I there's so many permutations which are I think are worthy knowing what kind of think are worthy knowing what kind of think are worthy knowing what kind of permutations you can run into but no. So permutations you can run into but no. So permutations you can run into but no. So to be clear, we looked first, right? We to be clear, we looked first, right? We to be clear, we looked first, right? We found nothing that was a dead fit. We found nothing that was a dead fit. We found nothing that was a dead fit. We took we took some stuff we found and took we took some stuff we found and took we took some stuff we found and added, as Jay mentioned, seven to nine added, as Jay mentioned, seven to nine added, as Jay mentioned, seven to nine might be new, you know, nodes or phases might be new, you know, nodes or phases might be new, you know, nodes or phases in the list. We're not here to debate or in the list. We're not here to debate or in the list. We're not here to debate or discuss or defend our choice of phases discuss or defend our choice of phases discuss or defend our choice of phases so much as we needed some framing in so much as we needed some framing in so much as we needed some framing in which to say MVE goes here. So, yeah, which to say MVE goes here. So, yeah, which to say MVE goes here. So, yeah, happy to discuss the phases, but they're happy to discuss the phases, but they're happy to discuss the phases, but they're they're they're for the purposes of our they're they're for the purposes of our they're they're for the purposes of our work more than go standardize a new one. work more than go standardize a new one. work more than go standardize a new one. Yeah, they're a means to an end. Yeah. Yeah, they're a means to an end. Yeah. Yeah, they're a means to an end. Yeah. So, and yes, um when things don't go in So, and yes, um when things don't go in So, and yes, um when things don't go in order, um right, you could you could order, um right, you could you could order, um right, you could you could just go from discovery, right, to just go from discovery, right, to just go from discovery, right, to finding it in the wild. I think I got finding it in the wild. I think I got finding it in the wild. I think I got the arrows all right. You can skip the the arrows all right. You can skip the the arrows all right. You can skip the part where it goes into database and go part where it goes into database and go part where it goes into database and go straight to uh I discover local straight to uh I discover local straight to uh I discover local compromised instances on my network and compromised instances on my network and compromised instances on my network and figure out I had an O day and then the figure out I had an O day and then the figure out I had an O day and then the whole we all love this fun high stakes whole we all love this fun high stakes whole we all love this fun high stakes meaningful high stress arrangement. So, meaningful high stress arrangement. So, meaningful high stress arrangement. So, just to say you could draw some arrows just to say you could draw some arrows just to say you could draw some arrows and erase some of the nodes and you can and erase some of the nodes and you can and erase some of the nodes and you can get different disclosure patterns. get different disclosure patterns. get different disclosure patterns. there's a whole bunch of work on the there's a whole bunch of work on the there's a whole bunch of work on the sequencing that we didn't get into um sequencing that we didn't get into um sequencing that we didn't get into um elsewhere in the world. So yeah, we elsewhere in the world. So yeah, we elsewhere in the world. So yeah, we didn't get into yet. Not yet. Yeah, this didn't get into yet. Not yet. Yeah, this didn't get into yet. Not yet. Yeah, this is ongoing. So this is just to put you is ongoing. So this is just to put you is ongoing. So this is just to put you back in the framing of our conceptual uh back in the framing of our conceptual uh back in the framing of our conceptual uh phases and then and this is what we were phases and then and this is what we were phases and then and this is what we were talking about. We've got the on the left talking about. We've got the on the left talking about. We've got the on the left side we've got sort of the private you side we've got sort of the private you side we've got sort of the private you know the um coordinated vulnerability know the um coordinated vulnerability know the um coordinated vulnerability discover discovery is happening there discover discovery is happening there discover discovery is happening there and then in the middle you've got where and then in the middle you've got where and then in the middle you've got where it transitions from private to public it transitions from private to public it transitions from private to public and how does that occur and this is and how does that occur and this is and how does that occur and this is where we wanted to focus and as we were where we wanted to focus and as we were where we wanted to focus and as we were talking about this we were thinking very talking about this we were thinking very talking about this we were thinking very much about product consumers and much about product consumers and much about product consumers and thinking about all the steps they had to thinking about all the steps they had to thinking about all the steps they had to do and the information they needed but do and the information they needed but do and the information they needed but then we had this then we had this then we had this realization that it actually looks more realization that it actually looks more realization that it actually looks more like this. Um, and I I created this like this. Um, and I I created this like this. Um, and I I created this slide and I just got tired of putting slide and I just got tired of putting slide and I just got tired of putting logos on here. So, if your logo's not in logos on here. So, if your logo's not in logos on here. So, if your logo's not in here, I apologize. Um, there could have here, I apologize. Um, there could have here, I apologize. Um, there could have been, you know, four, five more slides. Um, but this is really what the reality Um, but this is really what the reality Um, but this is really what the reality is. You've got all of these people and is. You've got all of these people and is. You've got all of these people and organizations with their own motives and organizations with their own motives and organizations with their own motives and their own goals at stake and they're their own goals at stake and they're their own goals at stake and they're they're going to speak up and say, "Hey, they're going to speak up and say, "Hey, they're going to speak up and say, "Hey, no, no. I in that record I want blah no, no. I in that record I want blah no, no. I in that record I want blah blah blah. I want that in there, you blah blah. I want that in there, you blah blah. I want that in there, you know, and so to just realize that know, and so to just realize that know, and so to just realize that there's a lot of forces, there's a lot there's a lot of forces, there's a lot there's a lot of forces, there's a lot of motivations and pulling and pushing of motivations and pulling and pushing of motivations and pulling and pushing and things like that. And this also and things like that. And this also and things like that. And this also illustrates, right, if I'm a mature illustrates, right, if I'm a mature illustrates, right, if I'm a mature large organization, I might be do my own large organization, I might be do my own large organization, I might be do my own vault management downstream, but I also vault management downstream, but I also vault management downstream, but I also probably hire somebody or pay someone probably hire somebody or pay someone probably hire somebody or pay someone else to help me do it. So whether you're else to help me do it. So whether you're else to help me do it. So whether you're a vendor of V management or doing it a vendor of V management or doing it a vendor of V management or doing it in-house, that all that all works here. in-house, that all that all works here. in-house, that all that all works here. Oh, another tidbit. If you are a fully Oh, another tidbit. If you are a fully Oh, another tidbit. If you are a fully vertical uh automatically patch all your vertical uh automatically patch all your vertical uh automatically patch all your software on your customers machines software on your customers machines software on your customers machines without them even knowing it's happening without them even knowing it's happening without them even knowing it's happening you know software supplier vendor is you know software supplier vendor is you know software supplier vendor is doing all of that all that path for you doing all of that all that path for you doing all of that all that path for you right so okay I'm going to go quickly right so okay I'm going to go quickly right so okay I'm going to go quickly fairly quickly through these actually I fairly quickly through these actually I fairly quickly through these actually I do you want to yeah I I think it's just do you want to yeah I I think it's just do you want to yeah I I think it's just to good to call out that like the phases to good to call out that like the phases to good to call out that like the phases and tasks that we talked about the roles and tasks that we talked about the roles and tasks that we talked about the roles we started out way more detailed I think we started out way more detailed I think we started out way more detailed I think we had I don't I don't know we had like we had I don't I don't know we had like we had I don't I don't know we had like a full page full of all of these roles a full page full of all of these roles a full page full of all of these roles And for the purpose of talking about And for the purpose of talking about And for the purpose of talking about what information elements we need, we what information elements we need, we what information elements we need, we reduced it down to these four. Tried to reduced it down to these four. Tried to reduced it down to these four. Tried to keep it really, really simple. You've keep it really, really simple. You've keep it really, really simple. You've got some kind of a producer, right? got some kind of a producer, right? got some kind of a producer, right? Making a product, an open source Making a product, an open source Making a product, an open source developer, IoT developer, whatever it developer, IoT developer, whatever it developer, IoT developer, whatever it is. You're producing something. And then is. You're producing something. And then is. You're producing something. And then you've got the third thing here or the you've got the third thing here or the you've got the third thing here or the the second one, sorry, the consumer. the second one, sorry, the consumer. the second one, sorry, the consumer. They're consuming it. And for most of They're consuming it. And for most of They're consuming it. And for most of the time, they're also responsible for the time, they're also responsible for the time, they're also responsible for remediating. But as Art said, maybe the remediating. But as Art said, maybe the remediating. But as Art said, maybe the producer pushes it and forces that producer pushes it and forces that producer pushes it and forces that patch, something like that. But the patch, something like that. But the patch, something like that. But the consumer generally is the one consumer generally is the one consumer generally is the one responsible for patching. But they may responsible for patching. But they may responsible for patching. But they may often have help with a vulnerability often have help with a vulnerability often have help with a vulnerability manager, could be within that manager, could be within that manager, could be within that organization, could be outsourced, and organization, could be outsourced, and organization, could be outsourced, and these are all sort of players in the these are all sort of players in the these are all sort of players in the field. And this is what we reduce down field. And this is what we reduce down field. And this is what we reduce down the entire complexity of the last few the entire complexity of the last few the entire complexity of the last few slides into the roles. Um there's a lot slides into the roles. Um there's a lot slides into the roles. Um there's a lot of nuance and a lot of yeah but what if of nuance and a lot of yeah but what if of nuance and a lot of yeah but what if uh type things in here but we wanted to uh type things in here but we wanted to uh type things in here but we wanted to keep it simple and just sort of talk keep it simple and just sort of talk keep it simple and just sort of talk about the producers and consumers and about the producers and consumers and about the producers and consumers and then the other folks. Yeah. And like the then the other folks. Yeah. And like the then the other folks. Yeah. And like the phases there are other lists of roles phases there are other lists of roles phases there are other lists of roles and we we're not arguing that ours is and we we're not arguing that ours is and we we're not arguing that ours is the best. Um so just just for for the the best. Um so just just for for the the best. Um so just just for for the purposes of of the framing really. So purposes of of the framing really. So purposes of of the framing really. So what are we know we had a big cloud word what are we know we had a big cloud word what are we know we had a big cloud word cloud earlier but slightly better cloud earlier but slightly better cloud earlier but slightly better defined these are some of the defined these are some of the defined these are some of the information elements that you might be information elements that you might be information elements that you might be familiar with in any of the records of familiar with in any of the records of familiar with in any of the records of your of your your favorite vulnerability your of your your favorite vulnerability your of your your favorite vulnerability records and art did the slides if you're records and art did the slides if you're records and art did the slides if you're wondering about the buildout and the wondering about the buildout and the wondering about the buildout and the clicking that we're doing art did the clicking that we're doing art did the clicking that we're doing art did the slides with the buildout and the a slides with the buildout and the a slides with the buildout and the a colleague a colleague I respect told me colleague a colleague I respect told me colleague a colleague I respect told me I had to do it this way so anyway all I had to do it this way so anyway all I had to do it this way so anyway all right so yeah this is the list that we right so yeah this is the list that we right so yeah this is the list that we tentatively came up with um clearly tentatively came up with um clearly tentatively came up with um clearly there are things missing. I think there there are things missing. I think there there are things missing. I think there for as many people in the room we could for as many people in the room we could for as many people in the room we could probably add at least one per person uh probably add at least one per person uh probably add at least one per person uh a level of details but we wanted to keep a level of details but we wanted to keep a level of details but we wanted to keep it sort of high level like for example it sort of high level like for example it sort of high level like for example the product identifier we didn't want to the product identifier we didn't want to the product identifier we didn't want to go into CPE versus SWID versus Pearl go into CPE versus SWID versus Pearl go into CPE versus SWID versus Pearl versus omnib versus wants to fight versus omnib versus wants to fight versus omnib versus wants to fight that's a different talk I think the but that's a different talk I think the but that's a different talk I think the but the point is all of those are going the point is all of those are going the point is all of those are going after a product identifier and we would after a product identifier and we would after a product identifier and we would want to know that product identifier want to know that product identifier want to know that product identifier whether we get there circular or direct whether we get there circular or direct whether we get there circular or direct you're around something, you know, it you're around something, you know, it you're around something, you know, it doesn't really matter. We need that doesn't really matter. We need that doesn't really matter. We need that product identifier. product identifier. product identifier. Yeah. Um, you know, we're pretty CVE Yeah. Um, you know, we're pretty CVE Yeah. Um, you know, we're pretty CVE based, but there are multiple based, but there are multiple based, but there are multiple vulnerability identifiers. If they meet vulnerability identifiers. If they meet vulnerability identifiers. If they meet those requirements, then they identify a those requirements, then they identify a those requirements, then they identify a vulnerability. That's great. Um, so vulnerability. That's great. Um, so vulnerability. That's great. Um, so again, nothing, this is not the entire again, nothing, this is not the entire again, nothing, this is not the entire list. Um, and we did skip sort of, you list. Um, and we did skip sort of, you list. Um, and we did skip sort of, you know, you want like dates on things, know, you want like dates on things, know, you want like dates on things, when it was published, maybe who wrote when it was published, maybe who wrote when it was published, maybe who wrote it, some of that stuff. We're sort of it, some of that stuff. We're sort of it, some of that stuff. We're sort of skipping the meta that maybe most good skipping the meta that maybe most good skipping the meta that maybe most good data sources would have, but we're not data sources would have, but we're not data sources would have, but we're not that we're not Yeah. calling Well, we're that we're not Yeah. calling Well, we're that we're not Yeah. calling Well, we're not paying a lot of attention to that, I not paying a lot of attention to that, I not paying a lot of attention to that, I don't think.

I think a good good data management is really key. As a big data management is really key. As a big data management is really key. As a big consumer of data, um we could I in our consumer of data, um we could I in our consumer of data, um we could I in our final paper, there's going to be a nice final paper, there's going to be a nice final paper, there's going to be a nice little section talking about stewardship little section talking about stewardship little section talking about stewardship of data.

Um, the vulnerability floating in space Um, the vulnerability floating in space Um, the vulnerability floating in space is like a C.WE with nothing to attach it is like a C.WE with nothing to attach it is like a C.WE with nothing to attach it to, right? I have a buffer overflow in to, right? I have a buffer overflow in to, right? I have a buffer overflow in what we need. The what? You have to have what we need. The what? You have to have what we need. The what? You have to have the what? We have to have a product the what? We have to have a product the what? We have to have a product using the term very broadly. Software of using the term very broadly. Software of using the term very broadly. Software of some kind probably hardware people. You some kind probably hardware people. You some kind probably hardware people. You can have a bug in hardware that's fine. can have a bug in hardware that's fine. can have a bug in hardware that's fine. Um, system, there's a problem in a Um, system, there's a problem in a Um, system, there's a problem in a thing. This is the object. A thing. This is the object. A thing. This is the object. A vulnerability affects a product. Yeah. vulnerability affects a product. Yeah. vulnerability affects a product. Yeah. Question, Mr. Fang. Question, Mr. Fang. Question, Mr. Fang. Oh, and and so his question was, are we Oh, and and so his question was, are we Oh, and and so his question was, are we including the version? including the version? including the version? Yes. And I I think that the product we Yes. And I I think that the product we Yes. And I I think that the product we just said product identifier, but there just said product identifier, but there just said product identifier, but there anyone who's looked at like uh when anyone who's looked at like uh when anyone who's looked at like uh when Microsoft lists out a vulnerability and Microsoft lists out a vulnerability and Microsoft lists out a vulnerability and the list of products and the way they the list of products and the way they the list of products and the way they define it is so detailed. It goes right define it is so detailed. It goes right define it is so detailed. It goes right down. And you can click click click down. And you can click click click down. And you can click click click click click um and there is a lot of click click um and there is a lot of click click um and there is a lot of stuff behind us saying product stuff behind us saying product stuff behind us saying product identifier but it it you need so as identifier but it it you need so as identifier but it it you need so as we're talking about referencing and and we're talking about referencing and and we're talking about referencing and and what when we talk about this art what when we talk about this art what when we talk about this art recommended a book to me about a recommended a book to me about a recommended a book to me about a philosophical discussion about naming philosophical discussion about naming philosophical discussion about naming things which was actually a really things which was actually a really things which was actually a really interesting book but what we want to do interesting book but what we want to do interesting book but what we want to do is have something that is have something that is have something that represents the actual product as as a represents the actual product as as a represents the actual product as as a consumer we need to be able to look at consumer we need to be able to look at consumer we need to be able to look at this reference and be able to go to the this reference and be able to go to the this reference and be able to go to the thing in our environment and say yes thing in our environment and say yes thing in our environment and say yes these two match this thing is talking these two match this thing is talking these two match this thing is talking about this exact thing. So you need about this exact thing. So you need about this exact thing. So you need version you need build numbers patch version you need build numbers patch version you need build numbers patch numbers all of those things help you numbers all of those things help you numbers all of those things help you identify is this in identify is this in identify is this in there I I I conceptually I consider there I I I conceptually I consider there I I I conceptually I consider version is probably part of the version is probably part of the version is probably part of the identifier. Yes, I know there's somebody identifier. Yes, I know there's somebody identifier. Yes, I know there's somebody I debate with who thinks it shouldn't I debate with who thinks it shouldn't I debate with who thinks it shouldn't be, but there's an argument to be had be, but there's an argument to be had be, but there's an argument to be had either way to all all that is either way to all all that is either way to all all that is identifying to me. Even the date it was identifying to me. Even the date it was identifying to me. Even the date it was released on or something, right? All released on or something, right? All released on or something, right? All that stuff helps you identify the thing, that stuff helps you identify the thing, that stuff helps you identify the thing, then it then it counts as a name. Um, a then it then it counts as a name. Um, a then it then it counts as a name. Um, a bunch of stuff missing, right? All of bunch of stuff missing, right? All of bunch of stuff missing, right? All of our favorite things. We have to go type our favorite things. We have to go type our favorite things. We have to go type in our scores and do all of our stuff. in our scores and do all of our stuff. in our scores and do all of our stuff. None of that's in the None of that's in the None of that's in the MVVE. I just I need to know what the MVVE. I just I need to know what the MVVE. I just I need to know what the thing is and I have to have a sense of thing is and I have to have a sense of thing is and I have to have a sense of what it affects. That is the absolute what it affects. That is the absolute what it affects. That is the absolute absolute bare minimum. So I feel pretty absolute bare minimum. So I feel pretty absolute bare minimum. So I feel pretty comfortable sorry with comfortable sorry with comfortable sorry with that but it kind of leaves me feeling a that but it kind of leaves me feeling a that but it kind of leaves me feeling a little empty also. Yeah. Yeah. And so we little empty also. Yeah. Yeah. And so we little empty also. Yeah. Yeah. And so we talked about you know we wanted to talked about you know we wanted to talked about you know we wanted to identify the minimum and these two identify the minimum and these two identify the minimum and these two things represent the minimum because if things represent the minimum because if things represent the minimum because if we went back to the timeline but it's we went back to the timeline but it's we went back to the timeline but it's like 40 clicks ago. Um, if we went back like 40 clicks ago. Um, if we went back like 40 clicks ago. Um, if we went back to the timeline though, you would see to the timeline though, you would see to the timeline though, you would see that when we get that public discovery that when we get that public discovery that when we get that public discovery and we want to identify that local and we want to identify that local and we want to identify that local instance. If you can't do that step, if instance. If you can't do that step, if instance. If you can't do that step, if you can't do that one step, nothing else you can't do that one step, nothing else you can't do that one step, nothing else matters. If you can do that step, we're matters. If you can do that step, we're matters. If you can do that step, we're living in the age of the internet. You living in the age of the internet. You living in the age of the internet. You can Google a CV ID. You can Google the can Google a CV ID. You can Google the can Google a CV ID. You can Google the vulnerability ID. You can look at that. vulnerability ID. You can look at that. vulnerability ID. You can look at that. Look up that product. Look for Look up that product. Look for Look up that product. Look for advisories. You can start to find advisories. You can start to find advisories. You can start to find things. the process will start. If you things. the process will start. If you things. the process will start. If you have these two fields, the process will have these two fields, the process will have these two fields, the process will start and it should get to completion. start and it should get to completion. start and it should get to completion. It'd be hard. You'd almost have nothing It'd be hard. You'd almost have nothing It'd be hard. You'd almost have nothing to prioritize on or to organize your to prioritize on or to organize your to prioritize on or to organize your vulnerabilities, but this is the vulnerabilities, but this is the vulnerabilities, but this is the minimum. This is the core of what you minimum. This is the core of what you minimum. This is the core of what you need to have everything else start and need to have everything else start and need to have everything else start and kick off and be enabled to execute. kick off and be enabled to execute. kick off and be enabled to execute. Yeah, without this, you're not doing Yeah, without this, you're not doing Yeah, without this, you're not doing anything else in ball management land anything else in ball management land anything else in ball management land because you don't you can't even find because you don't you can't even find because you don't you can't even find the thing. You don't know about the the thing. You don't know about the the thing. You don't know about the thing, right? Um, since I was left thing, right? Um, since I was left thing, right? Um, since I was left feeling empty and I perhaps Jay might feeling empty and I perhaps Jay might feeling empty and I perhaps Jay might have been also. Yeah. Um, we thought have been also. Yeah. Um, we thought have been also. Yeah. Um, we thought maybe there's a little bit extra maybe there's a little bit extra maybe there's a little bit extra MVE++ MVE plus what do we call the We MVE++ MVE plus what do we call the We MVE++ MVE plus what do we call the We just want a little more information. Uh, just want a little more information. Uh, just want a little more information. Uh, so like a week ago, I think we came up so like a week ago, I think we came up so like a week ago, I think we came up with uh the adequate enumeration. Yeah. with uh the adequate enumeration. Yeah. with uh the adequate enumeration. Yeah. All right. Um, guess what it has in it? All right. Um, guess what it has in it? All right. Um, guess what it has in it? Our favorite two things uh already Our favorite two things uh already Our favorite two things uh already because it has to have the MVVE in it. because it has to have the MVVE in it. because it has to have the MVVE in it. Um we think what to do about it this I Um we think what to do about it this I Um we think what to do about it this I don't know philosophically this bugs me don't know philosophically this bugs me don't know philosophically this bugs me a little but what you do about the thing a little but what you do about the thing a little but what you do about the thing seems important Jay. Yes. Yeah. If you seems important Jay. Yes. Yeah. If you seems important Jay. Yes. Yeah. If you think about it like prioritization it is required. I think prioritization it is required. I think prioritization it is required. I think in a modern society like where we are in a modern society like where we are in a modern society like where we are it's very much required. But like if you it's very much required. But like if you it's very much required. But like if you just identify that vulnerability, you've just identify that vulnerability, you've just identify that vulnerability, you've got the product identifier and you know got the product identifier and you know got the product identifier and you know what to do about it, that can get you to what to do about it, that can get you to what to do about it, that can get you to the end um sloppily and very the end um sloppily and very the end um sloppily and very inefficiently, but you can get there, inefficiently, but you can get there, inefficiently, but you can get there, right? Um the other stuff is cool, but right? Um the other stuff is cool, but right? Um the other stuff is cool, but you know, maybe it helps helps you you know, maybe it helps helps you you know, maybe it helps helps you phases, but it you don't need it. Yeah. phases, but it you don't need it. Yeah. phases, but it you don't need it. Yeah. That key key core level. And to and to That key key core level. And to and to That key key core level. And to and to bring back to the idea of a primary bring back to the idea of a primary bring back to the idea of a primary versus enriching database, like there's versus enriching database, like there's versus enriching database, like there's a lot of stuff that can be enriched. If a lot of stuff that can be enriched. If a lot of stuff that can be enriched. If you create a record, you don't have to you create a record, you don't have to you create a record, you don't have to create everything. So, in my opinion, a create everything. So, in my opinion, a create everything. So, in my opinion, a CVE does not have to be everything to CVE does not have to be everything to CVE does not have to be everything to everybody. It really it serves a purpose everybody. It really it serves a purpose everybody. It really it serves a purpose of being an identifier. And now we get of being an identifier. And now we get of being an identifier. And now we get things like Nvidia that enriches it. We things like Nvidia that enriches it. We things like Nvidia that enriches it. We get um other sources of enrichment that get um other sources of enrichment that get um other sources of enrichment that enriches things, you know, and we're enriches things, you know, and we're enriches things, you know, and we're getting ADPs now that are enriching getting ADPs now that are enriching getting ADPs now that are enriching things. or you can go to a vendor things. or you can go to a vendor things. or you can go to a vendor website and click click on a CV and get website and click click on a CV and get website and click click on a CV and get their enrichment of that vulnerability. their enrichment of that vulnerability. their enrichment of that vulnerability. The other stuff might be helpful and The other stuff might be helpful and The other stuff might be helpful and important to you. It's just not in our important to you. It's just not in our important to you. It's just not in our absolute minimum list. Yes. Question absolute minimum list. Yes. Question absolute minimum list. Yes. Question hopefully. Sorry. Click here. Yes. So, hopefully. Sorry. Click here. Yes. So, hopefully. Sorry. Click here. Yes. So, if you don't mind. Yeah. You have your if you don't mind. Yeah. You have your if you don't mind. Yeah. You have your vulnerability ID. You have your product vulnerability ID. You have your product vulnerability ID. You have your product identifier. identifier. identifier. All right. So, you've got your minimal All right. So, you've got your minimal All right. So, you've got your minimal viable. Well, why why do I care? In viable. Well, why why do I care? In viable. Well, why why do I care? In other words, where's the summary or other words, where's the summary or other words, where's the summary or description of what it is? description of what it is? description of what it is? Is that like is the intention like I Is that like is the intention like I Is that like is the intention like I need to go to that source to get that need to go to that source to get that need to go to that source to get that information in in the in the absolute information in in the in the absolute information in in the in the absolute minimum sense we're leaving that pretty minimum sense we're leaving that pretty minimum sense we're leaving that pretty open right so like as Jay mentioned it open right so like as Jay mentioned it open right so like as Jay mentioned it might be I have the ID I have to go might be I have the ID I have to go might be I have the ID I have to go track you know worst case I have to go track you know worst case I have to go track you know worst case I have to go track down that ID somewhere is my track down that ID somewhere is my track down that ID somewhere is my source the internet is it your favorite source the internet is it your favorite source the internet is it your favorite search engine have another database I search engine have another database I search engine have another database I know to look in um do I believe the know to look in um do I believe the know to look in um do I believe the person who issued the ID that it really person who issued the ID that it really person who issued the ID that it really is that vulnerability or not those is that vulnerability or not those is that vulnerability or not those questions are a little bit left open questions are a little bit left open questions are a little bit left open which is why again I felt it's a little which is why again I felt it's a little which is why again I felt it's a little bit unsatisfying to say that's all that bit unsatisfying to say that's all that bit unsatisfying to say that's all that you need but we're trying to be very you need but we're trying to be very you need but we're trying to be very technical about that is and that's it. technical about that is and that's it. technical about that is and that's it. So we don't we we leave that open to So we don't we we leave that open to So we don't we we leave that open to sort of further phases. And another sort of further phases. And another sort of further phases. And another thing that we talked about is like what thing that we talked about is like what thing that we talked about is like what is that vulnerability like what is the is that vulnerability like what is the is that vulnerability like what is the CWE is is a denial of service things CWE is is a denial of service things CWE is is a denial of service things like that like that like that like a simple description right and from like a simple description right and from like a simple description right and from from a defender standpoint like maybe from a defender standpoint like maybe from a defender standpoint like maybe you don't care like you you you may not you don't care like you you you may not you don't care like you you you may not like you don't have to care you all you like you don't have to care you all you like you don't have to care you all you know is you've got a vulnerable product know is you've got a vulnerable product know is you've got a vulnerable product you remediate it you're done you don't you remediate it you're done you don't you remediate it you're done you don't even care like was it a SQL injection or even care like was it a SQL injection or even care like was it a SQL injection or was it this or was that you don't care was it this or was that you don't care was it this or was that you don't care like just go fix it. I think a lot of us like just go fix it. I think a lot of us like just go fix it. I think a lot of us care. Minimum, right? You don't care. Minimum, right? You don't care. Minimum, right? You don't necessarily have to, right? At a necessarily have to, right? At a necessarily have to, right? At a minimum. Super close on time. Got two minimum. Super close on time. Got two minimum. Super close on time. Got two minutes. Yep. I'm going to jump ahead. minutes. Yep. I'm going to jump ahead. minutes. Yep. I'm going to jump ahead. Jerry, Jerry, Jerry, you guys kind of skipped over that, you guys kind of skipped over that, you guys kind of skipped over that, right? Are you okay with like saying right? Are you okay with like saying right? Are you okay with like saying this this affects this this affects this this affects everything? Are you the specificity of everything? Are you the specificity of everything? Are you the specificity of the I'm repeating your question. So, do the I'm repeating your question. So, do the I'm repeating your question. So, do we care about the specificity of the we care about the specificity of the we care about the specificity of the product identifier? product identifier? product identifier? Yes. Yeah. Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, we're low on time. We're like out of we're low on time. We're like out of we're low on time. We're like out of time. Let me let me let me finish two on time. Let me let me let me finish two on time. Let me let me let me finish two on one more slide and then we can talk one more slide and then we can talk one more slide and then we can talk after fang if that's okay. Sorry. Um after fang if that's okay. Sorry. Um after fang if that's okay. Sorry. Um we're going to skip this for the most we're going to skip this for the most we're going to skip this for the most part, but I'll put it up. part, but I'll put it up. part, but I'll put it up. Um this is more of almost more of a Um this is more of almost more of a Um this is more of almost more of a almost a slightly different question, almost a slightly different question, almost a slightly different question, but if we're talking about sort of but if we're talking about sort of but if we're talking about sort of exposures and not only only only exposures and not only only only exposures and not only only only vulnerabilities, does that change to vulnerabilities, does that change to vulnerabilities, does that change to MVVE? We don't know, but we're looking MVVE? We don't know, but we're looking MVVE? We don't know, but we're looking at that in our further work. And um yes, at that in our further work. And um yes, at that in our further work. And um yes, we started off writing a paper for this we started off writing a paper for this we started off writing a paper for this week. Over time, we decided to write week. Over time, we decided to write week. Over time, we decided to write slides for this week and we pretty much slides for this week and we pretty much slides for this week and we pretty much accomplished that. So, normal normal accomplished that. So, normal normal accomplished that. So, normal normal stuff there. There is a paper. It's stuff there. There is a paper. It's stuff there. There is a paper. It's pretty decent. It's going to get better. pretty decent. It's going to get better. pretty decent. It's going to get better. We will share it We will share it We will share it probably openly and then finish it. probably openly and then finish it. probably openly and then finish it. Yeah. Yeah. We'll welcome we will Yeah. Yeah. We'll welcome we will Yeah. Yeah. We'll welcome we will welcome some number of comments on it. welcome some number of comments on it. welcome some number of comments on it. Yeah. We'll welcome good comments Yeah. We'll welcome good comments Yeah. We'll welcome good comments though. Zero is a number. So, okay. All though. Zero is a number. So, okay. All though. Zero is a number. So, okay. All right. Um these slides are clear. right. Um these slides are clear. right. Um these slides are clear. They're going to be published and all They're going to be published and all They're going to be published and all that. If you care to do the thing, you that. If you care to do the thing, you that. If you care to do the thing, you can get the slides there. It's just a can get the slides there. It's just a can get the slides there. It's just a Google slide deck. Um, we'll be around Google slide deck. Um, we'll be around Google slide deck. Um, we'll be around for questions, but we should um obey our for questions, but we should um obey our for questions, but we should um obey our time and everything, right? Thank you time and everything, right? Thank you time and everything, right? Thank you all. Thank you.
