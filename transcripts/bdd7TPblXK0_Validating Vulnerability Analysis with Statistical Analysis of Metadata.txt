Kind: captions Language: en Hello everyone. Thank you for coming to Hello everyone. Thank you for coming to Hello everyone. Thank you for coming to the presentation. So um today we're the presentation. So um today we're the presentation. So um today we're discussing validating vulnerability discussing validating vulnerability discussing validating vulnerability analysis with a statistical analysis of analysis with a statistical analysis of analysis with a statistical analysis of metadata. Uh I'm Alexander Bushkin. I've metadata. Uh I'm Alexander Bushkin. I've metadata. Uh I'm Alexander Bushkin. I've got co-presenting with me today Keith got co-presenting with me today Keith got co-presenting with me today Keith Grant and uh fellow researchers Chess Grant and uh fellow researchers Chess Grant and uh fellow researchers Chess Hlett and Minra also helped on this uh Hlett and Minra also helped on this uh Hlett and Minra also helped on this uh on this research. So, for the first on this research. So, for the first on this research. So, for the first part, I'm going to turn it over to part, I'm going to turn it over to part, I'm going to turn it over to Keith. And um Keith, you can take it Keith. And um Keith, you can take it Keith. And um Keith, you can take it away anytime you want and just let me away anytime you want and just let me away anytime you want and just let me know when to switch slides. know when to switch slides. know when to switch slides. Yeah, thank you. And thank you everyone Yeah, thank you. And thank you everyone Yeah, thank you. And thank you everyone who's here. Um all right, so first I'm who's here. Um all right, so first I'm who's here. Um all right, so first I'm going to I'm going to talk about what going to I'm going to talk about what going to I'm going to talk about what exactly we're talking about here. I exactly we're talking about here. I exactly we're talking about here. I recognize the title is a little bit recognize the title is a little bit recognize the title is a little bit vague. Uh so I will start with the vague. Uh so I will start with the vague. Uh so I will start with the problem that we're trying to solve. I problem that we're trying to solve. I problem that we're trying to solve. I don't think it'll be news to anyone here don't think it'll be news to anyone here don't think it'll be news to anyone here that the number of vulnerabilities that that the number of vulnerabilities that that the number of vulnerabilities that are being reported every year is are being reported every year is are being reported every year is growing. And not only that, the rate at growing. And not only that, the rate at growing. And not only that, the rate at which they're being reported is growing which they're being reported is growing which they're being reported is growing as well. Uh despite that, we have the as well. Uh despite that, we have the as well. Uh despite that, we have the roughly the same number of analysts per roughly the same number of analysts per roughly the same number of analysts per flaws. And so the math there means that flaws. And so the math there means that flaws. And so the math there means that we have more flaws for each analyst to we have more flaws for each analyst to we have more flaws for each analyst to handle. And uh that puts us in a spot handle. And uh that puts us in a spot handle. And uh that puts us in a spot where we have to decide where we have to decide where we have to decide um do we do we manage that by improving um do we do we manage that by improving um do we do we manage that by improving uh an analyst's cadence in analyzing a uh an analyst's cadence in analyzing a uh an analyst's cadence in analyzing a flaw and if so how do we do that? That's flaw and if so how do we do that? That's flaw and if so how do we do that? That's one thing that we're trying to one thing that we're trying to one thing that we're trying to understand here. understand here. understand here. Um so as a vulnerability analyst I I Um so as a vulnerability analyst I I Um so as a vulnerability analyst I I kind of think you can classify flaws kind of think you can classify flaws kind of think you can classify flaws into one of two ways. Um well there are into one of two ways. Um well there are into one of two ways. Um well there are many classifications but one one many classifications but one one many classifications but one one classification I think of often are uh classification I think of often are uh classification I think of often are uh you will encounter flaws that you you will encounter flaws that you you will encounter flaws that you understand almost immediately because understand almost immediately because understand almost immediately because you've seen many flaws like them or you've seen many flaws like them or you've seen many flaws like them or you're very familiar with the um the you're very familiar with the um the you're very familiar with the um the technology whether it's like the technology whether it's like the technology whether it's like the programming language or the component or programming language or the component or programming language or the component or project that you're working in. And then project that you're working in. And then project that you're working in. And then there are flaws that are not like that. there are flaws that are not like that. there are flaws that are not like that. There are flaws that for whatever reason There are flaws that for whatever reason There are flaws that for whatever reason are not things that you've seen before. are not things that you've seen before. are not things that you've seen before. uh and to be able to analyze those uh and to be able to analyze those uh and to be able to analyze those rapidly. One of the best things is to be rapidly. One of the best things is to be rapidly. One of the best things is to be able to find similar flaws. Um no two able to find similar flaws. Um no two able to find similar flaws. Um no two flaws are alike obviously that's why we flaws are alike obviously that's why we flaws are alike obviously that's why we have CVE but there are a lot of have CVE but there are a lot of have CVE but there are a lot of similarities between flaws and the similarities between flaws and the similarities between flaws and the industry has already created metadata to industry has already created metadata to industry has already created metadata to capture those similarities to give us capture those similarities to give us capture those similarities to give us something that we can use to talk about something that we can use to talk about something that we can use to talk about flaws flaws flaws um in a like to comparison. So for um in a like to comparison. So for um in a like to comparison. So for example, CVSS and CWE are two examples example, CVSS and CWE are two examples example, CVSS and CWE are two examples of that which we'll talk about later. Uh of that which we'll talk about later. Uh of that which we'll talk about later. Uh and the other thing is we have a we have and the other thing is we have a we have and the other thing is we have a we have a lot of data in Red Hat. You know, we a lot of data in Red Hat. You know, we a lot of data in Red Hat. You know, we have uh databases of architectural or have uh databases of architectural or have uh databases of architectural or databases of information about our databases of information about our databases of information about our vulnerabilities going back to I think at vulnerabilities going back to I think at vulnerabilities going back to I think at least the late 90s. Not all of that is least the late 90s. Not all of that is least the late 90s. Not all of that is relevant anymore, but that's another relevant anymore, but that's another relevant anymore, but that's another that's one of the assets that we had to that's one of the assets that we had to that's one of the assets that we had to look at during this analysis is we have look at during this analysis is we have look at during this analysis is we have a lot of data about our past a lot of data about our past a lot of data about our past vulnerabilities. Uh, next slide vulnerabilities. Uh, next slide vulnerabilities. Uh, next slide please. So, we're going to start looking please. So, we're going to start looking please. So, we're going to start looking at which metadata specifically we chose at which metadata specifically we chose at which metadata specifically we chose and how we chose to use it. Uh, next and how we chose to use it. Uh, next and how we chose to use it. Uh, next slide please. So, uh there there are three please. So, uh there there are three please. So, uh there there are three major types of information that we're major types of information that we're major types of information that we're going to use this in this analysis that going to use this in this analysis that going to use this in this analysis that is CBSS, CWE and component. I'm assuming is CBSS, CWE and component. I'm assuming is CBSS, CWE and component. I'm assuming everyone here is more or less familiar everyone here is more or less familiar everyone here is more or less familiar with those. Um, but I'll talk a little with those. Um, but I'll talk a little with those. Um, but I'll talk a little bit I'll talk a little bit more about bit I'll talk a little bit more about bit I'll talk a little bit more about those uh in the future. And you can kind those uh in the future. And you can kind those uh in the future. And you can kind of think of those three as our of think of those three as our of think of those three as our independent variables and impact as our independent variables and impact as our independent variables and impact as our fourth uh our dependent variable. Within fourth uh our dependent variable. Within fourth uh our dependent variable. Within Red Hat, we have four categories of uh Red Hat, we have four categories of uh Red Hat, we have four categories of uh impact for vulnerabilities. We have low, impact for vulnerabilities. We have low, impact for vulnerabilities. We have low, moderate, important, and critical. moderate, important, and critical. moderate, important, and critical. And being able to correctly assign an And being able to correctly assign an And being able to correctly assign an impact to a flaw at an early uh early in impact to a flaw at an early uh early in impact to a flaw at an early uh early in analysis is important because the impact analysis is important because the impact analysis is important because the impact is basically what differentiates our is basically what differentiates our is basically what differentiates our level of effort. We obviously put the level of effort. We obviously put the level of effort. We obviously put the most effort into critical flaws and for most effort into critical flaws and for most effort into critical flaws and for some low flaws uh you know we'll only some low flaws uh you know we'll only some low flaws uh you know we'll only fix them if there's a customer request fix them if there's a customer request fix them if there's a customer request or something like that. So being able to or something like that. So being able to or something like that. So being able to get impact correct is is uh very get impact correct is is uh very get impact correct is is uh very important for us both to save ourselves important for us both to save ourselves important for us both to save ourselves unnecessary work if we classify unnecessary work if we classify unnecessary work if we classify something as too impactful or to avoid something as too impactful or to avoid something as too impactful or to avoid uh having to rush later to fix something uh having to rush later to fix something uh having to rush later to fix something if we recognize later that no actually if we recognize later that no actually if we recognize later that no actually this flaw that we thought was moderate this flaw that we thought was moderate this flaw that we thought was moderate is important. So that's our challenge. is important. So that's our challenge. is important. So that's our challenge. Um and we're going to take a look at how Um and we're going to take a look at how Um and we're going to take a look at how we're going to use our uh metadata to we're going to use our uh metadata to we're going to use our uh metadata to answer that question. Next slide please. answer that question. Next slide please. answer that question. Next slide please. Uh yeah. Okay. Uh yeah. Okay. Uh yeah. Okay. So, one of the ways in which we're So, one of the ways in which we're So, one of the ways in which we're trying to understand um these flaws and trying to understand um these flaws and trying to understand um these flaws and trying to understand their similarity is trying to understand their similarity is trying to understand their similarity is through a method called cluster through a method called cluster through a method called cluster analysis. And if you haven't um worked analysis. And if you haven't um worked analysis. And if you haven't um worked with this before, maybe you have done with this before, maybe you have done with this before, maybe you have done something like linear regression. uh and something like linear regression. uh and something like linear regression. uh and if you haven't done that before, the if you haven't done that before, the if you haven't done that before, the basic uh approach here is we're trying basic uh approach here is we're trying basic uh approach here is we're trying to look for ways that we can group flaws to look for ways that we can group flaws to look for ways that we can group flaws together based on their uh metadata together based on their uh metadata together based on their uh metadata based on their CWE, CBSS, the component. based on their CWE, CBSS, the component. based on their CWE, CBSS, the component. And when we group them together, we're And when we group them together, we're And when we group them together, we're looking for um natural clusters of looking for um natural clusters of looking for um natural clusters of flaws. Uh and there are a couple ways flaws. Uh and there are a couple ways flaws. Uh and there are a couple ways that we can look at this. So we can look that we can look at this. So we can look that we can look at this. So we can look at this um either saying I to either at this um either saying I to either at this um either saying I to either answer the question of how many um answer the question of how many um answer the question of how many um impact categories should we have like impact categories should we have like impact categories should we have like what what's the number of impact what what's the number of impact what what's the number of impact categories that ideally match the data categories that ideally match the data categories that ideally match the data set that we have. um we have four right set that we have. um we have four right set that we have. um we have four right now and maybe it would make more sense now and maybe it would make more sense now and maybe it would make more sense for us to have I don't know like six for us to have I don't know like six for us to have I don't know like six impact impact impact categories because it would make the uh categories because it would make the uh categories because it would make the uh boundaries between each of those boundaries between each of those boundaries between each of those categories clearer and we would spend categories clearer and we would spend categories clearer and we would spend less time worrying about whether we're less time worrying about whether we're less time worrying about whether we're assigning a correct impact. Uh assigning a correct impact. Uh assigning a correct impact. Uh contrarily, we could do something like contrarily, we could do something like contrarily, we could do something like um choose our cluster counts and say we um choose our cluster counts and say we um choose our cluster counts and say we want to have uh we want to find out how want to have uh we want to find out how want to have uh we want to find out how many impact categories we would need to many impact categories we would need to many impact categories we would need to have have have um all of our flaws evenly distributed um all of our flaws evenly distributed um all of our flaws evenly distributed among them. Obviously, that's not going among them. Obviously, that's not going among them. Obviously, that's not going to work too well because uh flaws are to work too well because uh flaws are to work too well because uh flaws are different in impact by by nature. different in impact by by nature. different in impact by by nature. Um, so those those are the the questions Um, so those those are the the questions Um, so those those are the the questions that we're trying to answer. And to be that we're trying to answer. And to be that we're trying to answer. And to be able to do this uh form of cluster able to do this uh form of cluster able to do this uh form of cluster analysis, we need to be able to analysis, we need to be able to analysis, we need to be able to um we need to be able to lay out our um we need to be able to lay out our um we need to be able to lay out our data in a reasonable way. Uh yeah, and data in a reasonable way. Uh yeah, and data in a reasonable way. Uh yeah, and I'm I'm going to pick things up a little I'm I'm going to pick things up a little I'm I'm going to pick things up a little bit here. So let's go ahead two more bit here. So let's go ahead two more bit here. So let's go ahead two more slides if you don't mind and we'll start slides if you don't mind and we'll start slides if you don't mind and we'll start talking about Okay. Yeah. So first we'll talking about Okay. Yeah. So first we'll talking about Okay. Yeah. So first we'll start with CVS. Uh the graph here is start with CVS. Uh the graph here is start with CVS. Uh the graph here is showing you some basic trivia about showing you some basic trivia about showing you some basic trivia about CVSS. Uh you might not CVSS. Uh you might not CVSS. Uh you might not have done the math before yourself, but have done the math before yourself, but have done the math before yourself, but there are about there are about there are about 2600 unique CVSS vectors. 2600 unique CVSS vectors. 2600 unique CVSS vectors. Um and out of out of those 2500 unique Um and out of out of those 2500 unique Um and out of out of those 2500 unique CVSs vectors within our data set, uh we CVSs vectors within our data set, uh we CVSs vectors within our data set, uh we only have assigned 836 only have assigned 836 only have assigned 836 unique different vectors. Uh but what unique different vectors. Uh but what unique different vectors. Uh but what this graph shows is it shows that even this graph shows is it shows that even this graph shows is it shows that even though there are that many um unique though there are that many um unique though there are that many um unique vectors, there are obviously only 101 vectors, there are obviously only 101 vectors, there are obviously only 101 possible scores um for each of those possible scores um for each of those possible scores um for each of those vectors to resolve to. And crucially, vectors to resolve to. And crucially, vectors to resolve to. And crucially, you can see that they're not evenly you can see that they're not evenly you can see that they're not evenly distributed. So there is already some distributed. So there is already some distributed. So there is already some bias built into CVSS in the bias built into CVSS in the bias built into CVSS in the calculations. Um, and I guess I should calculations. Um, and I guess I should calculations. Um, and I guess I should also mention here that we don't use CVSS also mention here that we don't use CVSS also mention here that we don't use CVSS score as the primary primary determinant score as the primary primary determinant score as the primary primary determinant of impact. Uh, and that's the reason of impact. Uh, and that's the reason of impact. Uh, and that's the reason that I I mentioned this here is because that I I mentioned this here is because that I I mentioned this here is because we can't just use CVSS score to we can't just use CVSS score to we can't just use CVSS score to determine our impact. Okay, next slide determine our impact. Okay, next slide determine our impact. Okay, next slide please. Um, and here is a simple a please. Um, and here is a simple a please. Um, and here is a simple a simple illustration of how CVSS vectors simple illustration of how CVSS vectors simple illustration of how CVSS vectors are distributed in our data set and are distributed in our data set and are distributed in our data set and which vectors they are is not totally which vectors they are is not totally which vectors they are is not totally important. I I put this here only to important. I I put this here only to important. I I put this here only to illustrate that the distribution of CVSS illustrate that the distribution of CVSS illustrate that the distribution of CVSS vectors in our data set is more or less vectors in our data set is more or less vectors in our data set is more or less a power law kind of distribution. We a power law kind of distribution. We a power law kind of distribution. We have a um we have a very few vectors have a um we have a very few vectors have a um we have a very few vectors that represent a lot of flaws and then that represent a lot of flaws and then that represent a lot of flaws and then we have a long tail of vectors where we have a long tail of vectors where we have a long tail of vectors where there are not many flaws that are that there are not many flaws that are that there are not many flaws that are that are like that. And that is something to are like that. And that is something to are like that. And that is something to consider when we're looking for consider when we're looking for consider when we're looking for similarity because we will find some similarity because we will find some similarity because we will find some flaws that are very easily that are very flaws that are very easily that are very flaws that are very easily that are very easy to find similar flaws to and some easy to find similar flaws to and some easy to find similar flaws to and some that are kind of that are kind of that are kind of unique. Uh yeah, next slide. Thank you. unique. Uh yeah, next slide. Thank you. unique. Uh yeah, next slide. Thank you. So So So um one of one of the things about CVSS um one of one of the things about CVSS um one of one of the things about CVSS is that it itself is a vector obviously. is that it itself is a vector obviously. is that it itself is a vector obviously. Uh it has a number of different uh Uh it has a number of different uh Uh it has a number of different uh elements to it and each of those elements to it and each of those elements to it and each of those elements have a different number of elements have a different number of elements have a different number of values. What this text on the left here values. What this text on the left here values. What this text on the left here is showing you is we did some um we did is showing you is we did some um we did is showing you is we did some um we did some correlation analysis between each some correlation analysis between each some correlation analysis between each of the individual elements of the CVSS of the individual elements of the CVSS of the individual elements of the CVSS factor and how much it how related it factor and how much it how related it factor and how much it how related it was to the final impact that we assigned was to the final impact that we assigned was to the final impact that we assigned the flaw. And our goal here was to find the flaw. And our goal here was to find the flaw. And our goal here was to find which of the CVSS elements in a vector which of the CVSS elements in a vector which of the CVSS elements in a vector are most uh informative of the final are most uh informative of the final are most uh informative of the final impact of the flaw in our data set. So impact of the flaw in our data set. So impact of the flaw in our data set. So this is obviously biased to our this is obviously biased to our this is obviously biased to our products. Um there are some observations products. Um there are some observations products. Um there are some observations here about which ones are most important here about which ones are most important here about which ones are most important that I you can look at later if you'd that I you can look at later if you'd that I you can look at later if you'd like but u I will skip for right now and like but u I will skip for right now and like but u I will skip for right now and let's continue. Yeah. let's continue. Yeah. let's continue. Yeah. Okay. So uh my my joke on the left here Okay. So uh my my joke on the left here Okay. So uh my my joke on the left here you can see you may have heard the you can see you may have heard the you can see you may have heard the phrase CIA triad to refer to um phrase CIA triad to refer to um phrase CIA triad to refer to um confidentiality uh integrity and confidentiality uh integrity and confidentiality uh integrity and availability. the part the base parts of availability. the part the base parts of availability. the part the base parts of the impact score for CVSS and I put them the impact score for CVSS and I put them the impact score for CVSS and I put them in a trash can only because not because in a trash can only because not because in a trash can only because not because I I think CIA is bad. CIA is great but I I think CIA is bad. CIA is great but I I think CIA is bad. CIA is great but uh I think thinking of them just as a uh I think thinking of them just as a uh I think thinking of them just as a triad of three different elements is a triad of three different elements is a triad of three different elements is a little too simple. So one of our first little too simple. So one of our first little too simple. So one of our first approaches here was this notion of approaches here was this notion of approaches here was this notion of treating only CIA only confidentiality treating only CIA only confidentiality treating only CIA only confidentiality impact and availability as its own impact and availability as its own impact and availability as its own space. treat each of those different space. treat each of those different space. treat each of those different elements as an axis in a elements as an axis in a elements as an axis in a threedimensional space which is helpful threedimensional space which is helpful threedimensional space which is helpful since they have the same number of since they have the same number of since they have the same number of possible values and you end up with this possible values and you end up with this possible values and you end up with this kind of cube. So the the green dot there kind of cube. So the the green dot there kind of cube. So the the green dot there in the center you can think of as an in the center you can think of as an in the center you can think of as an origin of this threedimensional space uh origin of this threedimensional space uh origin of this threedimensional space uh and you can see the three axes labeled and you can see the three axes labeled and you can see the three axes labeled there. And the interesting thing about there. And the interesting thing about there. And the interesting thing about this is if you pick any value for CIA, this is if you pick any value for CIA, this is if you pick any value for CIA, you know, none, low or high, you can you know, none, low or high, you can you know, none, low or high, you can plot that within this cube, within this plot that within this cube, within this plot that within this cube, within this cube of 27 different unique values. And cube of 27 different unique values. And cube of 27 different unique values. And by uh measuring the length of the vector by uh measuring the length of the vector by uh measuring the length of the vector from the origin to that, you can kind of from the origin to that, you can kind of from the origin to that, you can kind of get a sense of get a sense of get a sense of um you can kind of get a sense of how um you can kind of get a sense of how um you can kind of get a sense of how impactful that flaw is based on CIA. But impactful that flaw is based on CIA. But impactful that flaw is based on CIA. But of course this is already kind of of course this is already kind of of course this is already kind of duplicative in the score because uh what duplicative in the score because uh what duplicative in the score because uh what we're looking for here is not we're looking for here is not we're looking for here is not necessarily just impact but we're necessarily just impact but we're necessarily just impact but we're looking for flaw we're looking for ways looking for flaw we're looking for ways looking for flaw we're looking for ways to gauge uh flaws that are both similar to gauge uh flaws that are both similar to gauge uh flaws that are both similar and of similar impact. Uh so let's go to and of similar impact. Uh so let's go to and of similar impact. Uh so let's go to the to the next the to the next the to the next slide. Right. So our observation here slide. Right. So our observation here slide. Right. So our observation here when we were thinking about um how how when we were thinking about um how how when we were thinking about um how how we can express we can express we can express CVSS as a a continuous CVSS as a a continuous CVSS as a a continuous um a continuous value which is to say we um a continuous value which is to say we um a continuous value which is to say we don't want to treat each of the don't want to treat each of the don't want to treat each of the individual uh elements as their own individual uh elements as their own individual uh elements as their own dimension because for some of those dimension because for some of those dimension because for some of those elements like for scope for example elements like for scope for example elements like for scope for example there are only two possible two possible there are only two possible two possible there are only two possible two possible values. So if we treat that as its own values. So if we treat that as its own values. So if we treat that as its own dimension, it's going to be extremely dimension, it's going to be extremely dimension, it's going to be extremely unusful in clustering because uh unusful in clustering because uh unusful in clustering because uh everything will fall into one of two everything will fall into one of two everything will fall into one of two categories. Um and then we are going to categories. Um and then we are going to categories. Um and then we are going to have basically our dimensionality will have basically our dimensionality will have basically our dimensionality will increase to a point where most of our increase to a point where most of our increase to a point where most of our matrices are very very sparse and that matrices are very very sparse and that matrices are very very sparse and that makes clustering very hard. So this is makes clustering very hard. So this is makes clustering very hard. So this is uh our way of ordering uh our way of ordering uh our way of ordering CVSS and you can see uh on the the CVSS and you can see uh on the the CVSS and you can see uh on the the x-axis here is our index that we've x-axis here is our index that we've x-axis here is our index that we've assigned to um each of these CVSS assigned to um each of these CVSS assigned to um each of these CVSS vectors and the the y-axis here is the vectors and the the y-axis here is the vectors and the the y-axis here is the total score. Um there our motivation for total score. Um there our motivation for total score. Um there our motivation for doing this uh doing this uh doing this uh is basically a technique a technique is basically a technique a technique is basically a technique a technique called mixed radics counting where we called mixed radics counting where we called mixed radics counting where we count through each of the um elements in count through each of the um elements in count through each of the um elements in uh CVSS vector as though they were bases uh CVSS vector as though they were bases uh CVSS vector as though they were bases in a number system. There's a link there in a number system. There's a link there in a number system. There's a link there on uh the slide to the Wikipedia page on uh the slide to the Wikipedia page on uh the slide to the Wikipedia page about mixed radics math if you want to about mixed radics math if you want to about mixed radics math if you want to know more about it. But basically you know more about it. But basically you know more about it. But basically you can see the ordering on the slide here can see the ordering on the slide here can see the ordering on the slide here that we chose um which is in order of that we chose um which is in order of that we chose um which is in order of what was most relevant to impact for us. what was most relevant to impact for us. what was most relevant to impact for us. And then you can think of it like CIA uh And then you can think of it like CIA uh And then you can think of it like CIA uh sorry like let's say scope is the ones sorry like let's say scope is the ones sorry like let's say scope is the ones place user interaction is the 10's place place user interaction is the 10's place place user interaction is the 10's place uh attack complexity is the hundreds uh attack complexity is the hundreds uh attack complexity is the hundreds place so on and so forth. That's how we place so on and so forth. That's how we place so on and so forth. That's how we ordered these. The one uh the one key ordered these. The one uh the one key ordered these. The one uh the one key observation I'll make about this graph observation I'll make about this graph observation I'll make about this graph is that it obviously is not strictly in is that it obviously is not strictly in is that it obviously is not strictly in order of total CVSS score but it is it order of total CVSS score but it is it order of total CVSS score but it is it does keep very similar flaws close to does keep very similar flaws close to does keep very similar flaws close to each other and uh as you increase an each other and uh as you increase an each other and uh as you increase an index we can guarantee a floor of a CVSS index we can guarantee a floor of a CVSS index we can guarantee a floor of a CVSS score. So, we can't tell you uh score. So, we can't tell you uh score. So, we can't tell you uh necessarily how high or how high a CVSs necessarily how high or how high a CVSs necessarily how high or how high a CVSs score could be for a given index, but we score could be for a given index, but we score could be for a given index, but we can tell you that it will be at least can tell you that it will be at least can tell you that it will be at least above a minimum number, which is helpful above a minimum number, which is helpful above a minimum number, which is helpful because then if we're dealing with one because then if we're dealing with one because then if we're dealing with one of those flaws like I was mentioning of those flaws like I was mentioning of those flaws like I was mentioning where we're trying to determine the where we're trying to determine the where we're trying to determine the difference between a moderate and an difference between a moderate and an difference between a moderate and an important, we have a tool like this that important, we have a tool like this that important, we have a tool like this that we can use to find that floor of we can use to find that floor of we can use to find that floor of impact. Uh, okay. So, next let's move on impact. Uh, okay. So, next let's move on impact. Uh, okay. So, next let's move on to C.WE. Um, CWE is maybe a little bit to C.WE. Um, CWE is maybe a little bit to C.WE. Um, CWE is maybe a little bit more difficult because we know that CWEs more difficult because we know that CWEs more difficult because we know that CWEs have some impact, some relation have some impact, some relation have some impact, some relation relationship to impact, excuse me. Uh, relationship to impact, excuse me. Uh, relationship to impact, excuse me. Uh, because obviously there are some CVE or because obviously there are some CVE or because obviously there are some CVE or CWEs that um, typically have higher CWEs that um, typically have higher CWEs that um, typically have higher impact, some that typically have lower. impact, some that typically have lower. impact, some that typically have lower. But here again, if we're trying to But here again, if we're trying to But here again, if we're trying to create a total ordering of CWEs, that's create a total ordering of CWEs, that's create a total ordering of CWEs, that's even less non that's even less sensical even less non that's even less sensical even less non that's even less sensical than CVSS because C.WE we aren't uh they than CVSS because C.WE we aren't uh they than CVSS because C.WE we aren't uh they don't represent anything continuous. Um don't represent anything continuous. Um don't represent anything continuous. Um next slide please. But one of our key next slide please. But one of our key next slide please. But one of our key observations here was that you can observations here was that you can observations here was that you can represent CWEs in a space in their own represent CWEs in a space in their own represent CWEs in a space in their own way because CWE by design is already in way because CWE by design is already in way because CWE by design is already in graph form. Um you start with uh things graph form. Um you start with uh things graph form. Um you start with uh things like 699 which is a view which contains like 699 which is a view which contains like 699 which is a view which contains categories which themselves contain categories which themselves contain categories which themselves contain bases and variants etc. So there's bases and variants etc. So there's bases and variants etc. So there's already a hierarchical structure built already a hierarchical structure built already a hierarchical structure built into CWE. Uh and can we go to the next into CWE. Uh and can we go to the next into CWE. Uh and can we go to the next slide slide slide please? Um and I will explain this in a please? Um and I will explain this in a please? Um and I will explain this in a moment. So the hierarchical structure in moment. So the hierarchical structure in moment. So the hierarchical structure in CWE, what that allows us to do is uh it CWE, what that allows us to do is uh it CWE, what that allows us to do is uh it allows us to create a continuous allows us to create a continuous allows us to create a continuous ordering of C. we that maintains ordering of C. we that maintains ordering of C. we that maintains similarity by creating this tree where similarity by creating this tree where similarity by creating this tree where we have all of the parents we have all of the parents we have all of the parents um sorry where we order CWE in that um sorry where we order CWE in that um sorry where we order CWE in that hierarchical sense based on its uh it's hierarchical sense based on its uh it's hierarchical sense based on its uh it's actually a directed graph structure actually a directed graph structure actually a directed graph structure because there are a few loops because because there are a few loops because because there are a few loops because some some CWEs have more than one parent some some CWEs have more than one parent some some CWEs have more than one parent but then if we do a depth for search on but then if we do a depth for search on but then if we do a depth for search on that graph then that will give us an that graph then that will give us an that graph then that will give us an ordering of CWES ordering of CWES ordering of CWES uh that again maintains similarity and uh that again maintains similarity and uh that again maintains similarity and the reason that I put this graph the reason that I put this graph the reason that I put this graph together the coloring here is together the coloring here is together the coloring here is um gray are CWEs that were not included um gray are CWEs that were not included um gray are CWEs that were not included in our data set and for the most part in our data set and for the most part in our data set and for the most part those are CWEs that we shouldn't be those are CWEs that we shouldn't be those are CWEs that we shouldn't be assigning uh because assigning uh because assigning uh because they're um let's see not variance they're um let's see not variance they're um let's see not variance necessary but uh categories things like necessary but uh categories things like necessary but uh categories things like that um CWEs that are labeled in white that um CWEs that are labeled in white that um CWEs that are labeled in white here are uh kind of middle impact and here are uh kind of middle impact and here are uh kind of middle impact and then yellow into green is less impactful then yellow into green is less impactful then yellow into green is less impactful and orange into red is more impactful. and orange into red is more impactful. and orange into red is more impactful. The thing that I'm hoping to illustrate The thing that I'm hoping to illustrate The thing that I'm hoping to illustrate with this slide is that our intuition with this slide is that our intuition with this slide is that our intuition was borne out. Uh it's not entirely was borne out. Uh it's not entirely was borne out. Uh it's not entirely perfect, but you can see here that perfect, but you can see here that perfect, but you can see here that clusters of similar or clusters of CWEs clusters of similar or clusters of CWEs clusters of similar or clusters of CWEs that fall in the same place in the that fall in the same place in the that fall in the same place in the hierarchy have similar hierarchy have similar hierarchy have similar impacts. These impacts that we've impacts. These impacts that we've impacts. These impacts that we've determined are based on the most common determined are based on the most common determined are based on the most common impact in our data set for that given impact in our data set for that given impact in our data set for that given C.WE. Next slide, please. C.WE. Next slide, please. C.WE. Next slide, please. Um and then so the the third element Um and then so the the third element Um and then so the the third element that we were looking at the third that we were looking at the third that we were looking at the third metadata part was our component and this metadata part was our component and this metadata part was our component and this is u what software is affected like is u what software is affected like is u what software is affected like we're talking about kernel or something we're talking about kernel or something we're talking about kernel or something and we could uh and we we tried just and we could uh and we we tried just and we could uh and we we tried just arbitrarily ordering these something arbitrarily ordering these something arbitrarily ordering these something like alphabetical order. Um but one of like alphabetical order. Um but one of like alphabetical order. Um but one of our key observations was that there are our key observations was that there are our key observations was that there are because of how we because of how we because of how we because of how we because of how we because of how we represent uh components in our data set. represent uh components in our data set. represent uh components in our data set. Sometimes we'll have something that's Sometimes we'll have something that's Sometimes we'll have something that's sort of generic like kernel here but sort of generic like kernel here but sort of generic like kernel here but then we also have components for then we also have components for then we also have components for subsystems of the kernel like u memory subsystems of the kernel like u memory subsystems of the kernel like u memory management KVM things like that. And so management KVM things like that. And so management KVM things like that. And so in ordering our um components, we did in ordering our um components, we did in ordering our um components, we did choose to order them kind of choose to order them kind of choose to order them kind of arbitrarily. But uh if you think of each arbitrarily. But uh if you think of each arbitrarily. But uh if you think of each component like each basic component like component like each basic component like component like each basic component like kernel here as uh being placed on an kernel here as uh being placed on an kernel here as uh being placed on an integer on a number line, we then divide integer on a number line, we then divide integer on a number line, we then divide that integer between all of the that integer between all of the that integer between all of the different subcomponents of that different subcomponents of that different subcomponents of that component. Um so excuse me one moment. component. Um so excuse me one moment. component. Um so excuse me one moment. I'm going to take a closer look here. I'm going to take a closer look here. I'm going to take a closer look here. Uh so you can see like kernel would be Uh so you can see like kernel would be Uh so you can see like kernel would be um yeah sorry kernel kernel falls into um yeah sorry kernel kernel falls into um yeah sorry kernel kernel falls into the first bucket. Colonel KVM will be uh the first bucket. Colonel KVM will be uh the first bucket. Colonel KVM will be uh between one and two and kernel KVM NVMX between one and two and kernel KVM NVMX between one and two and kernel KVM NVMX will be even uh will further divide that will be even uh will further divide that will be even uh will further divide that space so that we end up with a number space so that we end up with a number space so that we end up with a number line that has all of our components in line that has all of our components in line that has all of our components in an order that keeps similar components an order that keeps similar components an order that keeps similar components and subcomponents next to each and subcomponents next to each and subcomponents next to each other. And with that, I will hand it other. And with that, I will hand it other. And with that, I will hand it over to Alex who's going to show you over to Alex who's going to show you over to Alex who's going to show you some of our results. Thanks, Keith. So some of our results. Thanks, Keith. So some of our results. Thanks, Keith. So uh now that we kind of explained a bit uh now that we kind of explained a bit uh now that we kind of explained a bit the approach into how we wanted to the approach into how we wanted to the approach into how we wanted to encode the data and kind of let's say encode the data and kind of let's say encode the data and kind of let's say pre-process it, let's look at um pre-process it, let's look at um pre-process it, let's look at um essentially what the clustering results essentially what the clustering results essentially what the clustering results showed. So before that let's get to the showed. So before that let's get to the showed. So before that let's get to the actual data set. Right? So right now actual data set. Right? So right now actual data set. Right? So right now we've been talking about CVSS, we've we've been talking about CVSS, we've we've been talking about CVSS, we've been talking about CW, we've been been talking about CW, we've been been talking about CW, we've been talking about um the components and how talking about um the components and how talking about um the components and how we wanted to use them. Another thing, we wanted to use them. Another thing, we wanted to use them. Another thing, another important consideration was another important consideration was another important consideration was obviously the data set. we decided to obviously the data set. we decided to obviously the data set. we decided to restrict ourselves to the past four restrict ourselves to the past four restrict ourselves to the past four years of data just because it was easier years of data just because it was easier years of data just because it was easier to manage let's say with respect to um to manage let's say with respect to um to manage let's say with respect to um you know fairly similar um ways of you know fairly similar um ways of you know fairly similar um ways of handling it right like one of the key uh handling it right like one of the key uh handling it right like one of the key uh points one of the key takeaways that points one of the key takeaways that points one of the key takeaways that we're trying to say is that uh you have we're trying to say is that uh you have we're trying to say is that uh you have to consider not just bias inherent in to consider not just bias inherent in to consider not just bias inherent in the data obviously but you have to the data obviously but you have to the data obviously but you have to consider the bias in the context that consider the bias in the context that consider the bias in the context that creates the data so that's why we had creates the data so that's why we had creates the data so that's why we had considerations like for example um not considerations like for example um not considerations like for example um not all CWE IDs that we had assigned to all CWE IDs that we had assigned to all CWE IDs that we had assigned to vulnerabilities were within the 699 and vulnerabilities were within the 699 and vulnerabilities were within the 699 and the 1194 views, we tried to restrict the 1194 views, we tried to restrict the 1194 views, we tried to restrict ourselves to like the software ourselves to like the software ourselves to like the software development, the hardware development development, the hardware development development, the hardware development view. And of course, then there's view. And of course, then there's view. And of course, then there's considerations about like what to do considerations about like what to do considerations about like what to do with chaining or with oring. Um, with chaining or with oring. Um, with chaining or with oring. Um, similarly, in terms of the skewing, we similarly, in terms of the skewing, we similarly, in terms of the skewing, we had an over representation of kernel had an over representation of kernel had an over representation of kernel flaws, right? Because as we know, flaws, right? Because as we know, flaws, right? Because as we know, kernel.org has published numerous kernel.org has published numerous kernel.org has published numerous amounts of of flaws over the past uh amounts of of flaws over the past uh amounts of of flaws over the past uh year and a half. And that leads to over year and a half. And that leads to over year and a half. And that leads to over representation. In particular, if we representation. In particular, if we representation. In particular, if we consider the fact that by default uh the consider the fact that by default uh the consider the fact that by default uh the way that we handle vulnerabilities is uh way that we handle vulnerabilities is uh way that we handle vulnerabilities is uh they come in with a 5.5 until they get they come in with a 5.5 until they get they come in with a 5.5 until they get analyzed and once they get analyzed then analyzed and once they get analyzed then analyzed and once they get analyzed then the score ch changes. But if we have the score ch changes. But if we have the score ch changes. But if we have like a lot of lows and moderates or just like a lot of lows and moderates or just like a lot of lows and moderates or just flaws that we're not able to get to flaws that we're not able to get to flaws that we're not able to get to analyze in time that can lead to a analyze in time that can lead to a analyze in time that can lead to a skewing of the data. So essentially what skewing of the data. So essentially what skewing of the data. So essentially what we took from what we started with was we took from what we started with was we took from what we started with was those 14,000 flaws roughly from those those 14,000 flaws roughly from those those 14,000 flaws roughly from those four years of data and we reduced it four years of data and we reduced it four years of data and we reduced it down to 7,415 flaws which was what we down to 7,415 flaws which was what we down to 7,415 flaws which was what we actually used to perform the clustering actually used to perform the clustering actually used to perform the clustering and what we you and what we you and what we you know attempted to um kind of uh make know attempted to um kind of uh make know attempted to um kind of uh make sure was consistent in terms of um the sure was consistent in terms of um the sure was consistent in terms of um the kind of data. So making sure that they kind of data. So making sure that they kind of data. So making sure that they were all within this for example all were all within this for example all were all within this for example all within the 699 view or the 1194 view. So within the 699 view or the 1194 view. So within the 699 view or the 1194 view. So in terms of clustering uh when we look in terms of clustering uh when we look in terms of clustering uh when we look at components it worked kind of the way at components it worked kind of the way at components it worked kind of the way we wanted it to right the objective was we wanted it to right the objective was we wanted it to right the objective was not necessarily to have an inherent not necessarily to have an inherent not necessarily to have an inherent order as in uh from left to right order as in uh from left to right order as in uh from left to right demonstrates something in terms of demonstrates something in terms of demonstrates something in terms of impact as being more important but impact as being more important but impact as being more important but rather the prevalence of a specific rather the prevalence of a specific rather the prevalence of a specific product or a specific component in the product or a specific component in the product or a specific component in the vulnerability data set. Since you know vulnerability data set. Since you know vulnerability data set. Since you know kernel publishes a lot more flaws, we kernel publishes a lot more flaws, we kernel publishes a lot more flaws, we have a lot more representation of kernel have a lot more representation of kernel have a lot more representation of kernel and that's what we ended up with um when and that's what we ended up with um when and that's what we ended up with um when it got put assigned essentially into the it got put assigned essentially into the it got put assigned essentially into the bucket at index one. So that's why you bucket at index one. So that's why you bucket at index one. So that's why you see this like big swarm of of data or of see this like big swarm of of data or of see this like big swarm of of data or of data points on the left hand side of the data points on the left hand side of the data points on the left hand side of the component axis. component axis. component axis. Um as you go right you can see that it Um as you go right you can see that it Um as you go right you can see that it it peters out. That's more so just the it peters out. That's more so just the it peters out. That's more so just the fact that you know there might be a fact that you know there might be a fact that you know there might be a product that only ever showed up once in product that only ever showed up once in product that only ever showed up once in those four years worth of data. So it those four years worth of data. So it those four years worth of data. So it only gets you know one point. If we look only gets you know one point. If we look only gets you know one point. If we look at CWE the um the spacing is a little at CWE the um the spacing is a little at CWE the um the spacing is a little bit more difficult. It's not as obvious bit more difficult. It's not as obvious bit more difficult. It's not as obvious visually what it can tell you. Um partly visually what it can tell you. Um partly visually what it can tell you. Um partly that's because you know the 699 and the that's because you know the 699 and the that's because you know the 699 and the 1194 views we did use uh depth first 1194 views we did use uh depth first 1194 views we did use uh depth first search in terms of how we mapped the search in terms of how we mapped the search in terms of how we mapped the nodes but there's overlap between just nodes but there's overlap between just nodes but there's overlap between just ids right so there are going to be ids ids right so there are going to be ids ids right so there are going to be ids for example in the 1194 view that might for example in the 1194 view that might for example in the 1194 view that might be in the 300 range just like there are be in the 300 range just like there are be in the 300 range just like there are some from the 699 view the big thing some from the 699 view the big thing some from the 699 view the big thing with the gaps here that you can say is with the gaps here that you can say is with the gaps here that you can say is that there are specific parts where no that there are specific parts where no that there are specific parts where no red hat products are impacted by those red hat products are impacted by those red hat products are impacted by those specific weaknesses but the CWE access specific weaknesses but the CWE access specific weaknesses but the CWE access in itself in itself in itself Once we show when we're going to Once we show when we're going to Once we show when we're going to describe it a little bit later on um describe it a little bit later on um describe it a little bit later on um it's less visual but it does um help it's less visual but it does um help it's less visual but it does um help explain how some of the clustering explain how some of the clustering explain how some of the clustering uh happened let's say if we look at CVSS uh happened let's say if we look at CVSS uh happened let's say if we look at CVSS right we spent a lot of time explaining right we spent a lot of time explaining right we spent a lot of time explaining the modulo system it worked the way we the modulo system it worked the way we the modulo system it worked the way we wanted it to work essentially um we were wanted it to work essentially um we were wanted it to work essentially um we were grouping flaws by similarity not just uh grouping flaws by similarity not just uh grouping flaws by similarity not just uh inherently the score itself which is why inherently the score itself which is why inherently the score itself which is why you can see this banding effect you can see this banding effect you can see this banding effect obviously part of the banding effect is obviously part of the banding effect is obviously part of the banding effect is like Keith mentioned at the beginning like Keith mentioned at the beginning like Keith mentioned at the beginning there are certain score ranges that are there are certain score ranges that are there are certain score ranges that are just unreachable. And so that's going to just unreachable. And so that's going to just unreachable. And so that's going to be consistent throughout. The other be consistent throughout. The other be consistent throughout. The other thing that you can note is that there is thing that you can note is that there is thing that you can note is that there is for example, so let me just quickly for example, so let me just quickly for example, so let me just quickly explain the coloring. Uh green is low, explain the coloring. Uh green is low, explain the coloring. Uh green is low, blue is moderate, yellow is important, blue is moderate, yellow is important, blue is moderate, yellow is important, red is critical. So you can see that red is critical. So you can see that red is critical. So you can see that there's a consistent banding uh of there's a consistent banding uh of there's a consistent banding uh of primarily moderates, right? Which is primarily moderates, right? Which is primarily moderates, right? Which is mostly what we end up seeing. Um that mostly what we end up seeing. Um that mostly what we end up seeing. Um that goes all the way through. What we're goes all the way through. What we're goes all the way through. What we're going to see in a minute with the band going to see in a minute with the band going to see in a minute with the band analysis is that um the actual CIA analysis is that um the actual CIA analysis is that um the actual CIA impact is what changes. The reason that impact is what changes. The reason that impact is what changes. The reason that we see moderates that even end up at we see moderates that even end up at we see moderates that even end up at that high range right at that the top of that high range right at that the top of that high range right at that the top of what could be the most severe CBSS what could be the most severe CBSS what could be the most severe CBSS impacts is because this is where the impacts is because this is where the impacts is because this is where the other let's say components of the CBSS other let's say components of the CBSS other let's say components of the CBSS vector come into play. If CIA is you vector come into play. If CIA is you vector come into play. If CIA is you know the the main impact factor what can know the the main impact factor what can know the the main impact factor what can change something from being moderate or change something from being moderate or change something from being moderate or important or critical or low could be important or critical or low could be important or critical or low could be all the other factors right the attack all the other factors right the attack all the other factors right the attack vector the privileges required the vector the privileges required the vector the privileges required the complexity things like that so looking complexity things like that so looking complexity things like that so looking at the first band obviously I apologize at the first band obviously I apologize at the first band obviously I apologize for the names uh we're not exactly for the names uh we're not exactly for the names uh we're not exactly creative um but we called it DOSville creative um but we called it DOSville creative um but we called it DOSville essentially the idea here was that based essentially the idea here was that based essentially the idea here was that based off of a very simple analysis of what off of a very simple analysis of what off of a very simple analysis of what was the most prevalent CIA a um values was the most prevalent CIA a um values was the most prevalent CIA a um values for those vulnerabilities in that for those vulnerabilities in that for those vulnerabilities in that cluster and the corresponding let's say cluster and the corresponding let's say cluster and the corresponding let's say CW and CVSS ranges we saw that primarily CW and CVSS ranges we saw that primarily CW and CVSS ranges we saw that primarily it was DOSS like behavior so you know it was DOSS like behavior so you know it was DOSS like behavior so you know only availability is impacted if we look only availability is impacted if we look only availability is impacted if we look at band two configuration bill so at band two configuration bill so at band two configuration bill so similarly we saw primarily an impact similarly we saw primarily an impact similarly we saw primarily an impact being on the confidentiality uh value of being on the confidentiality uh value of being on the confidentiality uh value of CIA however it's low right so that tells CIA however it's low right so that tells CIA however it's low right so that tells us that okay you're compromising us that okay you're compromising us that okay you're compromising something but it's probably not very something but it's probably not very something but it's probably not very important uh information. Keep that in important uh information. Keep that in important uh information. Keep that in mind when we get to band four. In band mind when we get to band four. In band mind when we get to band four. In band three, this is kind of the mixed bag, three, this is kind of the mixed bag, three, this is kind of the mixed bag, right? It's in the middle of roughly, right? It's in the middle of roughly, right? It's in the middle of roughly, you know, the least severe to the most you know, the least severe to the most you know, the least severe to the most severe CBS scores. So, it makes sense severe CBS scores. So, it makes sense severe CBS scores. So, it makes sense that here's kind of that range where that here's kind of that range where that here's kind of that range where it's difficult to define a specific it's difficult to define a specific it's difficult to define a specific trend. This is kind of where you find trend. This is kind of where you find trend. This is kind of where you find those, okay, low impact on uh those, okay, low impact on uh those, okay, low impact on uh confidentiality and integrity. That confidentiality and integrity. That confidentiality and integrity. That could be a lot of things, right? There's could be a lot of things, right? There's could be a lot of things, right? There's not a a specific thing, but that makes not a a specific thing, but that makes not a a specific thing, but that makes sense, right? We're in the middle of the sense, right? We're in the middle of the sense, right? We're in the middle of the road. Band four was interesting because road. Band four was interesting because road. Band four was interesting because similar to uh band two now we have the similar to uh band two now we have the similar to uh band two now we have the same sort of thing. We called it piville same sort of thing. We called it piville same sort of thing. We called it piville because now the confidentiality um because now the confidentiality um because now the confidentiality um impact is high. So this is where we're impact is high. So this is where we're impact is high. So this is where we're getting to the kinds of vulnerabilities getting to the kinds of vulnerabilities getting to the kinds of vulnerabilities that are you know are impacting that are you know are impacting that are you know are impacting confidentiality and it's sensitive confidentiality and it's sensitive confidentiality and it's sensitive information that is being information that is being information that is being compromised. Band five data manipulation compromised. Band five data manipulation compromised. Band five data manipulation bill again very creative name. The idea bill again very creative name. The idea bill again very creative name. The idea here is we're starting to see you know here is we're starting to see you know here is we're starting to see you know the the more severe kinds of flaws. So, the the more severe kinds of flaws. So, the the more severe kinds of flaws. So, CIA, CI are high in terms of impact, CIA, CI are high in terms of impact, CIA, CI are high in terms of impact, that's, you know, in line with things that's, you know, in line with things that's, you know, in line with things getting more severe. And if we look at getting more severe. And if we look at getting more severe. And if we look at band six, um, worst case, right? This is band six, um, worst case, right? This is band six, um, worst case, right? This is everything's high. Um, everything is as everything's high. Um, everything is as everything's high. Um, everything is as bad as it could possibly bad as it could possibly bad as it could possibly be. The key takeaways though from those be. The key takeaways though from those be. The key takeaways though from those sorts of banding things actually come in sorts of banding things actually come in sorts of banding things actually come in when we look at the when we look at the when we look at the C.WE for each of the uh, bands. So for C.WE for each of the uh, bands. So for C.WE for each of the uh, bands. So for example in that low range what we called example in that low range what we called example in that low range what we called dosville the most common CWE that we dosville the most common CWE that we dosville the most common CWE that we found was 401. Now 401 is defined as found was 401. Now 401 is defined as found was 401. Now 401 is defined as missing uh rebase of memory after missing uh rebase of memory after missing uh rebase of memory after effective lifetime. Right? So that's the effective lifetime. Right? So that's the effective lifetime. Right? So that's the sorts of vulnerabilities or weaknesses sorts of vulnerabilities or weaknesses sorts of vulnerabilities or weaknesses that can lead to vulnerabilities that that can lead to vulnerabilities that that can lead to vulnerabilities that lead to memory exhaustion. So the the lead to memory exhaustion. So the the lead to memory exhaustion. So the the typical things that could lead to a typical things that could lead to a typical things that could lead to a denial of service over time. Similarly denial of service over time. Similarly denial of service over time. Similarly in that 2000 to 2500 range the primarily in that 2000 to 2500 range the primarily in that 2000 to 2500 range the primarily the what we call data manipulation bill. the what we call data manipulation bill. the what we call data manipulation bill. The primary thing that we saw there was The primary thing that we saw there was The primary thing that we saw there was improper handling of extra values. That improper handling of extra values. That improper handling of extra values. That kind of uh weakness ties into things kind of uh weakness ties into things kind of uh weakness ties into things like buffer overflows, ties into like like buffer overflows, ties into like like buffer overflows, ties into like out of bounds reads, writes, the things out of bounds reads, writes, the things out of bounds reads, writes, the things that can get you to remote code that can get you to remote code that can get you to remote code execution that can get you to execution that can get you to execution that can get you to um rce things like well yeah remote code um rce things like well yeah remote code um rce things like well yeah remote code execution you know writing over memory execution you know writing over memory execution you know writing over memory essentially things that compromise CI in essentially things that compromise CI in essentially things that compromise CI in a significant manner. a significant manner. a significant manner. So, so far what we've done is we've kind So, so far what we've done is we've kind So, so far what we've done is we've kind of explained the approach in encoding of explained the approach in encoding of explained the approach in encoding the data which was the primary thing and the data which was the primary thing and the data which was the primary thing and we showed some initial clustering. we showed some initial clustering. we showed some initial clustering. There's obviously a lot more that can be There's obviously a lot more that can be There's obviously a lot more that can be done done done um with taking this research further um with taking this research further um with taking this research further which we have the intention to do and which we have the intention to do and which we have the intention to do and I'm going to turn it over to Keith for I'm going to turn it over to Keith for I'm going to turn it over to Keith for the first two points. the first two points. the first two points. Uh yeah. So, so some of the first things Uh yeah. So, so some of the first things Uh yeah. So, so some of the first things now that we have this space where we can now that we have this space where we can now that we have this space where we can plot all of our vulnerabilities uh both plot all of our vulnerabilities uh both plot all of our vulnerabilities uh both historically and as we analyze them, we historically and as we analyze them, we historically and as we analyze them, we can ask some questions like given all of can ask some questions like given all of can ask some questions like given all of the metadata for this flaw, is anything the metadata for this flaw, is anything the metadata for this flaw, is anything about it unusual? Um how how similar is about it unusual? Um how how similar is about it unusual? Um how how similar is this flaw to its neighbors in that this flaw to its neighbors in that this flaw to its neighbors in that threedimensional space? threedimensional space? threedimensional space? Uh and our hope is that we'll be able to Uh and our hope is that we'll be able to Uh and our hope is that we'll be able to use that to identify either flaws that use that to identify either flaws that use that to identify either flaws that we maybe have not analyzed correctly in we maybe have not analyzed correctly in we maybe have not analyzed correctly in the moment or flaws that uh were the moment or flaws that uh were the moment or flaws that uh were analyzed in the past that require that analyzed in the past that require that analyzed in the past that require that warrant some more closer investigation warrant some more closer investigation warrant some more closer investigation while at the same time we don't want while at the same time we don't want while at the same time we don't want every flaw to become um too similar to every flaw to become um too similar to every flaw to become um too similar to all of its neighbors because we then we all of its neighbors because we then we all of its neighbors because we then we end up losing the unique qualities of end up losing the unique qualities of end up losing the unique qualities of each vulnerability and we end up each vulnerability and we end up each vulnerability and we end up regressing to a mean where every flaw is regressing to a mean where every flaw is regressing to a mean where every flaw is just the same thing. That's what we want just the same thing. That's what we want just the same thing. That's what we want to avoid. Um because sometimes flaws are to avoid. Um because sometimes flaws are to avoid. Um because sometimes flaws are actually outliers. Sometimes flaws are actually outliers. Sometimes flaws are actually outliers. Sometimes flaws are unlike flaws that we've seen before. But unlike flaws that we've seen before. But unlike flaws that we've seen before. But at least if we can look and we can at least if we can look and we can at least if we can look and we can validate that and validate that and validate that and say with certainty that we understand say with certainty that we understand say with certainty that we understand why it's different, that is of benefit why it's different, that is of benefit why it's different, that is of benefit to us. Yep. And um taking that further to us. Yep. And um taking that further to us. Yep. And um taking that further um one of the nice things that would um one of the nice things that would um one of the nice things that would would be useful for analysts, right? would be useful for analysts, right? would be useful for analysts, right? Because all of this comes back to how Because all of this comes back to how Because all of this comes back to how are you analyzing vulnerabilities are you analyzing vulnerabilities are you analyzing vulnerabilities especially with a high volume and a lack especially with a high volume and a lack especially with a high volume and a lack let's say you're you're constrained on let's say you're you're constrained on let's say you're you're constrained on resources right so what would be helpful resources right so what would be helpful resources right so what would be helpful is if while an analyst in our case at is if while an analyst in our case at is if while an analyst in our case at Red Hat is working on uh analyzing a Red Hat is working on uh analyzing a Red Hat is working on uh analyzing a flaw and they're messing let's say with flaw and they're messing let's say with flaw and they're messing let's say with the metadata values like CVSS CWE and the metadata values like CVSS CWE and the metadata values like CVSS CWE and they have the the existing component they have the the existing component they have the the existing component list geoloccating within that cluster list geoloccating within that cluster list geoloccating within that cluster space where based off of those values a space where based off of those values a space where based off of those values a flaw is starting to, you know, what flaw is starting to, you know, what flaw is starting to, you know, what neighborhood it's it's showing up in, neighborhood it's it's showing up in, neighborhood it's it's showing up in, what band. That's where we start what band. That's where we start what band. That's where we start thinking about presenting the analyst thinking about presenting the analyst thinking about presenting the analyst with similar vulnerabilities. You know, with similar vulnerabilities. You know, with similar vulnerabilities. You know, doing something like a distance function doing something like a distance function doing something like a distance function to find the four nearest neighbors. Not to find the four nearest neighbors. Not to find the four nearest neighbors. Not so much to automate the process of so much to automate the process of so much to automate the process of analysis, but to kind of assist to say, analysis, but to kind of assist to say, analysis, but to kind of assist to say, look, you're in Dosville, right? You're look, you're in Dosville, right? You're look, you're in Dosville, right? You're you're in a low impact area. The CIA you're in a low impact area. The CIA you're in a low impact area. The CIA value is none none low, right? value is none none low, right? value is none none low, right? So, keep that in mind while you're So, keep that in mind while you're So, keep that in mind while you're analyzing this flaw. It could be analyzing this flaw. It could be analyzing this flaw. It could be something that is within that something that is within that something that is within that neighborhood that has similar neighborhood that has similar neighborhood that has similar characteristics to flaws that you've characteristics to flaws that you've characteristics to flaws that you've already analyzed. That's one thing that already analyzed. That's one thing that already analyzed. That's one thing that that we're working on. Obviously, the that we're working on. Obviously, the that we're working on. Obviously, the other one is improving our methodology. other one is improving our methodology. other one is improving our methodology. I think that's kind of part for the I think that's kind of part for the I think that's kind of part for the course, right? I mean, there's always course, right? I mean, there's always course, right? I mean, there's always better uh search techniques and data better uh search techniques and data better uh search techniques and data structures that we can use. We can think structures that we can use. We can think structures that we can use. We can think about how we handle chaining better. We about how we handle chaining better. We about how we handle chaining better. We can think about how, you know, we could can think about how, you know, we could can think about how, you know, we could rethink, you know, how we're how we're rethink, you know, how we're how we're rethink, you know, how we're how we're querying uh our data set, things like querying uh our data set, things like querying uh our data set, things like that. Speaking to the point of uh that. Speaking to the point of uh that. Speaking to the point of uh outlier, we wanted to kind of end on outlier, we wanted to kind of end on outlier, we wanted to kind of end on this one because we had this particular this one because we had this particular this one because we had this particular critical in the second band here in the critical in the second band here in the critical in the second band here in the 500 to,000 range which was the only 500 to,000 range which was the only 500 to,000 range which was the only critical there and we kind of went to critical there and we kind of went to critical there and we kind of went to look at it. We was like, hm, maybe this look at it. We was like, hm, maybe this look at it. We was like, hm, maybe this is one of those cases where something is one of those cases where something is one of those cases where something was mislabeled. Looking at the was mislabeled. Looking at the was mislabeled. Looking at the vulnerability, which happens to be this vulnerability, which happens to be this vulnerability, which happens to be this CB CB CB 20244896, which by the way, we weren't 20244896, which by the way, we weren't 20244896, which by the way, we weren't impacted. So that's good. Um uh it's impacted. So that's good. Um uh it's impacted. So that's good. Um uh it's kind of a unique case where it's one of kind of a unique case where it's one of kind of a unique case where it's one of those rare cases where you have a triad those rare cases where you have a triad those rare cases where you have a triad that's non high, right? There's no that's non high, right? There's no that's non high, right? There's no confidentially confidentiality impact, confidentially confidentiality impact, confidentially confidentiality impact, but you do have a high integrity and but you do have a high integrity and but you do have a high integrity and availability impact. In this case, it availability impact. In this case, it availability impact. In this case, it happens to line up. It it is correct happens to line up. It it is correct happens to line up. It it is correct because it's one of those situations because it's one of those situations because it's one of those situations where you could be with libby parsing where you could be with libby parsing where you could be with libby parsing some sort of user config, right? you some sort of user config, right? you some sort of user config, right? you you're you're vulnerable to this you're you're vulnerable to this you're you're vulnerable to this external entity which could allow for external entity which could allow for external entity which could allow for you know some sort of like remote code you know some sort of like remote code you know some sort of like remote code execution or it could lead to some sort execution or it could lead to some sort execution or it could lead to some sort of DOSs right because you're pulling in of DOSs right because you're pulling in of DOSs right because you're pulling in unverified uh external entities but at unverified uh external entities but at unverified uh external entities but at the same time you're parsing a user the same time you're parsing a user the same time you're parsing a user config file so there's no conf config file so there's no conf config file so there's no conf confidentiality there being compromised confidentiality there being compromised confidentiality there being compromised so this was just an example of like so this was just an example of like so this was just an example of like verifying that you know actually yes it verifying that you know actually yes it verifying that you know actually yes it is correct where it's found so you know is correct where it's found so you know is correct where it's found so you know anomalies sometimes are anomalies but anomalies sometimes are anomalies but anomalies sometimes are anomalies but there's a lot more that we can can think there's a lot more that we can can think there's a lot more that we can can think about uh doing which we we intend to do about uh doing which we we intend to do about uh doing which we we intend to do uh moving forward So, um, Keith, any uh moving forward So, um, Keith, any uh moving forward So, um, Keith, any final words or, uh, should we sign off? final words or, uh, should we sign off? final words or, uh, should we sign off? No, I think, um, I think we're at our No, I think, um, I think we're at our No, I think, um, I think we're at our time. So, thank you for if you I will time. So, thank you for if you I will time. So, thank you for if you I will say if you have any questions, feel free say if you have any questions, feel free say if you have any questions, feel free to contact us offline and we we would be to contact us offline and we we would be to contact us offline and we we would be happy to talk about this because we're happy to talk about this because we're happy to talk about this because we're going to continue with this research as going to continue with this research as going to continue with this research as Alex said. But, thank you for attending.
