Kind: captions Language: en Okay, thank you all for joining us. Um, Okay, thank you all for joining us. Um, Okay, thank you all for joining us. Um, I know it's the it's the end of the day, I know it's the it's the end of the day, I know it's the it's the end of the day, so we'll try and keep it uh so we'll try and keep it uh so we'll try and keep it uh entertaining insurance. Okay. Um, so so entertaining insurance. Okay. Um, so so entertaining insurance. Okay. Um, so so basically what you see on the screen is basically what you see on the screen is basically what you see on the screen is the ecosystem the ecosystem the ecosystem um that we've developed uh to kind of um that we've developed uh to kind of um that we've developed uh to kind of connect the dots, right? And the idea is connect the dots, right? And the idea is connect the dots, right? And the idea is a cohesive strategy a cohesive strategy a cohesive strategy uh bringing in multiple uh disciplines uh bringing in multiple uh disciplines uh bringing in multiple uh disciplines so that we we have a a very cohesive um so that we we have a a very cohesive um so that we we have a a very cohesive um security strategy. Right? Uh so the way security strategy. Right? Uh so the way security strategy. Right? Uh so the way it works and and we'll get into details. it works and and we'll get into details. it works and and we'll get into details. So this is just an overview as we go So this is just an overview as we go So this is just an overview as we go along. Uh each of us will break down our along. Uh each of us will break down our along. Uh each of us will break down our areas of expertise and kind of go areas of expertise and kind of go areas of expertise and kind of go through them. Uh but we want to kind of through them. Uh but we want to kind of through them. Uh but we want to kind of paint the picture for you and how it paint the picture for you and how it paint the picture for you and how it works. Um the ultimate goal works. Um the ultimate goal works. Um the ultimate goal here is to provide a here is to provide a here is to provide a um trustworthy code to our customers, um trustworthy code to our customers, um trustworthy code to our customers, right? And that's that's what we're right? And that's that's what we're right? And that's that's what we're going for here. Uh so we bring in uh going for here. Uh so we bring in uh going for here. Uh so we bring in uh different disciplines, different different disciplines, different different disciplines, different uh programs and and collect that uh programs and and collect that uh programs and and collect that information and then uh on the back end information and then uh on the back end information and then uh on the back end use it in different ways. use it in different ways. use it in different ways. Uh so the idea is is that you have the Uh so the idea is is that you have the Uh so the idea is is that you have the BUS they're creating the the product BUS they're creating the the product BUS they're creating the the product they're doing the coding they go through they're doing the coding they go through they're doing the coding they go through their build pipeline they create an their build pipeline they create an their build pipeline they create an inventory so you'll hear me talk a inventory so you'll hear me talk a inventory so you'll hear me talk a couple uh as I talk about DMP and and couple uh as I talk about DMP and and couple uh as I talk about DMP and and maybe as as Cassie talks about PERT maybe as as Cassie talks about PERT maybe as as Cassie talks about PERT we'll talk about inventory we'll talk we'll talk about inventory we'll talk we'll talk about inventory we'll talk about ESPOM um what I want you all to about ESPOM um what I want you all to about ESPOM um what I want you all to understand understand understand uh inventory is really how we look at it uh inventory is really how we look at it uh inventory is really how we look at it so inventory is the intake. Um when we so inventory is the intake. Um when we so inventory is the intake. Um when we when we talk about dependency inventory when we talk about dependency inventory when we talk about dependency inventory and dependency management, inventory is and dependency management, inventory is and dependency management, inventory is that intake, right? So uh product teams that intake, right? So uh product teams that intake, right? So uh product teams are going through their build, they're are going through their build, they're are going through their build, they're putting together an inventory of putting together an inventory of putting together an inventory of components. Those components are both um components. Those components are both um components. Those components are both um third party and third party and third party and internal. Uh so the third party could be internal. Uh so the third party could be internal. Uh so the third party could be a supplier or it could be open source, a supplier or it could be open source, a supplier or it could be open source, right? Um, so we we'll talk about right? Um, so we we'll talk about right? Um, so we we'll talk about inventory going into dependency inventory going into dependency inventory going into dependency management and then we'll talk about an management and then we'll talk about an management and then we'll talk about an SBOM coming out. Let's be clear, they're SBOM coming out. Let's be clear, they're SBOM coming out. Let's be clear, they're sbombs, right? They're all sbombs, sbombs, right? They're all sbombs, sbombs, right? They're all sbombs, right? We're using we are using um SPDX. right? We're using we are using um SPDX. right? We're using we are using um SPDX. Right now we're using 2.3 both on the Right now we're using 2.3 both on the Right now we're using 2.3 both on the intake and the export. Um, but we intake and the export. Um, but we intake and the export. Um, but we separate, like I said, we'll talk about separate, like I said, we'll talk about separate, like I said, we'll talk about inventory on the front end, espec you you all know what I'm talking espec you you all know what I'm talking espec you you all know what I'm talking about. about. about. Um with that we take information from Um with that we take information from Um with that we take information from the BUS not only the the component the BUS not only the the component the BUS not only the the component uh inventory but there's a program going uh inventory but there's a program going uh inventory but there's a program going on within the BU's uh or actually it's on within the BU's uh or actually it's on within the BU's uh or actually it's it's within SRO but working with the BUS it's within SRO but working with the BUS it's within SRO but working with the BUS uh for open-source software um uh for open-source software um uh for open-source software um assurance and so as part of that they've assurance and so as part of that they've assurance and so as part of that they've developed a uh open-source developed a uh open-source developed a uh open-source trustworthiness score that we're using trustworthiness score that we're using trustworthiness score that we're using and so criteria has been put together. and so criteria has been put together. and so criteria has been put together. Uh the way it will work is that there is Uh the way it will work is that there is Uh the way it will work is that there is a a a um trusted repository. So you can see um trusted repository. So you can see um trusted repository. So you can see that so um developers will no longer be that so um developers will no longer be that so um developers will no longer be able to just go out and grab any open able to just go out and grab any open able to just go out and grab any open source. They'll have to go through the source. They'll have to go through the source. They'll have to go through the trusted repository as part of that trusted repository as part of that trusted repository as part of that process of going from a I need to use process of going from a I need to use process of going from a I need to use this to you're allowed to use this. um this to you're allowed to use this. um this to you're allowed to use this. um there'll be some review of it and and there'll be some review of it and and there'll be some review of it and and you know make sure that it adheres to you know make sure that it adheres to you know make sure that it adheres to everything. There'll also be a score everything. There'll also be a score everything. There'll also be a score attached to it. So the idea of the score attached to it. So the idea of the score attached to it. So the idea of the score I believe at this point is to simply I believe at this point is to simply I believe at this point is to simply give guidance. Um it may become more of give guidance. Um it may become more of give guidance. Um it may become more of a gate uh you know a gateway for for a gate uh you know a gateway for for a gate uh you know a gateway for for developers to use it. But I think at developers to use it. But I think at developers to use it. But I think at this point it's it's just merely this point it's it's just merely this point it's it's just merely guidance. Um with that said a couple of guidance. Um with that said a couple of guidance. Um with that said a couple of things. So on the on the TPRM side or things. So on the on the TPRM side or things. So on the on the TPRM side or the procurement side, we're we're the procurement side, we're we're the procurement side, we're we're working with TPRM, uh we're trying to uh working with TPRM, uh we're trying to uh working with TPRM, uh we're trying to uh get information out of our systems there get information out of our systems there get information out of our systems there um so that we can standardize uh um so that we can standardize uh um so that we can standardize uh suppliers. So we're going to look at suppliers. So we're going to look at suppliers. So we're going to look at suppliers to start with. We're going to suppliers to start with. We're going to suppliers to start with. We're going to standardize that information. All of standardize that information. All of standardize that information. All of that goes into the DMP or the deposit uh that goes into the DMP or the deposit uh that goes into the DMP or the deposit uh the dependency the dependency the dependency inventory. Once we have all of this in inventory. Once we have all of this in inventory. Once we have all of this in there and again on the TPRM side, we're there and again on the TPRM side, we're there and again on the TPRM side, we're going to have a a supplier going to have a a supplier going to have a a supplier trustworthiness score as well. Um again, trustworthiness score as well. Um again, trustworthiness score as well. Um again, uh it'll help us down the line and and uh it'll help us down the line and and uh it'll help us down the line and and as both Julia and Cassie start to talk as both Julia and Cassie start to talk as both Julia and Cassie start to talk about their details, you'll start to see about their details, you'll start to see about their details, you'll start to see where it all kind of um comes together. where it all kind of um comes together. where it all kind of um comes together. Uh but then you know uh once Uh but then you know uh once Uh but then you know uh once everything's in in the inventory everything's in in the inventory everything's in in the inventory repository and I'm going to say this um repository and I'm going to say this um repository and I'm going to say this um everybody talks about esbombs right everybody talks about esbombs right everybody talks about esbombs right sbombs sbombs but if you don't have the sbombs sbombs but if you don't have the sbombs sbombs but if you don't have the inventory and you don't have the inventory and you don't have the inventory and you don't have the inventory in a quality format and and inventory in a quality format and and inventory in a quality format and and you know what you're doing we build you know what you're doing we build you know what you're doing we build rappers around that whole process we do rappers around that whole process we do rappers around that whole process we do have I'll be honest we have an sea tool have I'll be honest we have an sea tool have I'll be honest we have an sea tool that is backending us on that process that is backending us on that process that is backending us on that process but we've built tools around it so that but we've built tools around it so that but we've built tools around it so that we can do checks as we're importing that we can do checks as we're importing that we can do checks as we're importing that if something doesn't meet our quality if something doesn't meet our quality if something doesn't meet our quality standards, we kick it back to the BUS standards, we kick it back to the BUS standards, we kick it back to the BUS and they have to update it before it'll and they have to update it before it'll and they have to update it before it'll come into us. Uh, one of the other come into us. Uh, one of the other come into us. Uh, one of the other things is that as part of our controls, things is that as part of our controls, things is that as part of our controls, they are required to register that they are required to register that they are required to register that inventory in there so that we know inventory in there so that we know inventory in there so that we know exactly what's going out the door. exactly what's going out the door. exactly what's going out the door. Again, when I talk about quality, it is Again, when I talk about quality, it is Again, when I talk about quality, it is not content so much as it is maybe not content so much as it is maybe not content so much as it is maybe format and making sure that certain format and making sure that certain format and making sure that certain fields are adhered to things like that. fields are adhered to things like that. fields are adhered to things like that. We we have no idea what goes into their We we have no idea what goes into their We we have no idea what goes into their product. They do. They're responsible product. They do. They're responsible product. They do. They're responsible for that. But we're going to check to for that. But we're going to check to for that. But we're going to check to make sure that they they do certain make sure that they they do certain make sure that they they do certain things. So on the supplier side, we're things. So on the supplier side, we're things. So on the supplier side, we're going to make sure that they're using a going to make sure that they're using a going to make sure that they're using a standardized naming for the suppliers so standardized naming for the suppliers so standardized naming for the suppliers so that we can go through and look at, you that we can go through and look at, you that we can go through and look at, you know, you have Dell, DELMC, the, you know, you have Dell, DELMC, the, you know, you have Dell, DELMC, the, you know, the Dell, Dell Technology, know, the Dell, Dell Technology, know, the Dell, Dell Technology, whatever it is. Um, we're going to try whatever it is. Um, we're going to try whatever it is. Um, we're going to try to standardize that so that we can look to standardize that so that we can look to standardize that so that we can look across, uh, our inventories to be able across, uh, our inventories to be able across, uh, our inventories to be able to see what suppliers, what BUs are to see what suppliers, what BUs are to see what suppliers, what BUs are using, what suppliers. uh it'll help one using, what suppliers. uh it'll help one using, what suppliers. uh it'll help one in the trustworthiness of that supplier in the trustworthiness of that supplier in the trustworthiness of that supplier and make sure that we're doing the right and make sure that we're doing the right and make sure that we're doing the right things for our customers, two things for our customers, two things for our customers, two negotiations, you know, those types of negotiations, you know, those types of negotiations, you know, those types of things. Uh as we get to the dependency things. Uh as we get to the dependency things. Uh as we get to the dependency management, we're going to bring those management, we're going to bring those management, we're going to bring those supplier sbombs in, things like that. supplier sbombs in, things like that. supplier sbombs in, things like that. So, it'll help with that. So, it'll help with that. So, it'll help with that. Um everything in there feeds out, right? Um everything in there feeds out, right? Um everything in there feeds out, right? So, so we talked about esbomb and that So, so we talked about esbomb and that So, so we talked about esbomb and that goes out to the customers. There's a goes out to the customers. There's a goes out to the customers. There's a whole program around esbombs. I think whole program around esbombs. I think whole program around esbombs. I think Adid's been here a couple of times to Adid's been here a couple of times to Adid's been here a couple of times to talk about it. talk about it. talk about it. Um, we're also going to do met um Um, we're also going to do met um Um, we're also going to do met um metrics on all of this, right? So, a lot metrics on all of this, right? So, a lot metrics on all of this, right? So, a lot of this, a lot of the information that of this, a lot of the information that of this, a lot of the information that we have is going to be driven through we have is going to be driven through we have is going to be driven through metrics, dashboards. It'll help with metrics, dashboards. It'll help with metrics, dashboards. It'll help with remediation. It'll help with um remediation. It'll help with um remediation. It'll help with um guidance. It will help with, you know, guidance. It will help with, you know, guidance. It will help with, you know, where do we have to change processes or where do we have to change processes or where do we have to change processes or educate people in what they're doing. educate people in what they're doing. educate people in what they're doing. And then finally, you know, the the PERT And then finally, you know, the the PERT And then finally, you know, the the PERT side of things, right? So outputting uh side of things, right? So outputting uh side of things, right? So outputting uh vulnerability reports and and then um vulnerability reports and and then um vulnerability reports and and then um you know being able to apply VEX to you know being able to apply VEX to you know being able to apply VEX to those and being able to be those and being able to be those and being able to be um ahead of our customers, right? So we um ahead of our customers, right? So we um ahead of our customers, right? So we know what we have. We know the know what we have. We know the know what we have. We know the vulnerabilities that are associated with vulnerabilities that are associated with vulnerabilities that are associated with them. We know how these impact our them. We know how these impact our them. We know how these impact our products. Spent a lot of time on that. products. Spent a lot of time on that. products. Spent a lot of time on that. I'm sorry. Um so here's where I live. Uh I'm sorry. Um so here's where I live. Uh I'm sorry. Um so here's where I live. Uh dependency management. So this came dependency management. So this came dependency management. So this came about we we started as I said there's an about we we started as I said there's an about we we started as I said there's an SEA tool underneath this uh we started SEA tool underneath this uh we started SEA tool underneath this uh we started with SEA we were talking about you know with SEA we were talking about you know with SEA we were talking about you know finding out open source right and and finding out open source right and and finding out open source right and and using that when log forj came using that when log forj came using that when log forj came around we said oh we can use this tool around we said oh we can use this tool around we said oh we can use this tool to figure out who's impacted and then we to figure out who's impacted and then we to figure out who's impacted and then we said oh we can look at inventories said oh we can look at inventories said oh we can look at inventories across the board and then the EO came across the board and then the EO came across the board and then the EO came out and we were like okay now we're out and we were like okay now we're out and we were like okay now we're going to know everything right we're going to know everything right we're going to know everything right we're going to you know as a part of the the going to you know as a part of the the going to you know as a part of the the executive order 140 028 not that I have executive order 140 028 not that I have executive order 140 028 not that I have that memorized but um as a part of that that memorized but um as a part of that that memorized but um as a part of that we had to make sure that we understood we had to make sure that we understood we had to make sure that we understood all components going in um so that's all components going in um so that's all components going in um so that's where dependency management platform where dependency management platform where dependency management platform really came out of so we put these really came out of so we put these really came out of so we put these inventories in they will have as I said inventories in they will have as I said inventories in they will have as I said all all all components now again what goes in the components now again what goes in the components now again what goes in the inventory doesn't necessarily go out to inventory doesn't necessarily go out to inventory doesn't necessarily go out to the SBA um there are things there are the SBA um there are things there are the SBA um there are things there are reasons to not disclose components like reasons to not disclose components like reasons to not disclose components like under NDA or an internal name that would under NDA or an internal name that would under NDA or an internal name that would not necessarily have any meaning to an not necessarily have any meaning to an not necessarily have any meaning to an external user, right? Um, so we, you external user, right? Um, so we, you external user, right? Um, so we, you know, the the in again I can't stress know, the the in again I can't stress know, the the in again I can't stress enough how I talk about the inventory. enough how I talk about the inventory. enough how I talk about the inventory. The inventory, if you have everything The inventory, if you have everything The inventory, if you have everything that you want in that inventory, then that you want in that inventory, then that you want in that inventory, then the rest of these feed out pretty the rest of these feed out pretty the rest of these feed out pretty easily, right? Um, so, you know, again, easily, right? Um, so, you know, again, easily, right? Um, so, you know, again, we're putting in the supplier um we're putting in the supplier um we're putting in the supplier um trustworthiness. We're putting in the trustworthiness. We're putting in the trustworthiness. We're putting in the OSS trustworthiness. Once everything's OSS trustworthiness. Once everything's OSS trustworthiness. Once everything's in there, we have the in there, we have the in there, we have the component. For the most part, anything component. For the most part, anything component. For the most part, anything that's open source are our and and we're that's open source are our and and we're that's open source are our and and we're working on this. There are no nobody working on this. There are no nobody working on this. There are no nobody here knows that there's a problem here knows that there's a problem here knows that there's a problem sometimes mapping open source to Yeah, I sometimes mapping open source to Yeah, I sometimes mapping open source to Yeah, I know, right? Surprise. I know. Um so, so know, right? Surprise. I know. Um so, so know, right? Surprise. I know. Um so, so we are working on we keep we keep trying we are working on we keep we keep trying we are working on we keep we keep trying to mature that process, right? We work to mature that process, right? We work to mature that process, right? We work with RSCA vendor. We work internally to with RSCA vendor. We work internally to with RSCA vendor. We work internally to create processes. I talked about create processes. I talked about create processes. I talked about standardizing things. You know what I standardizing things. You know what I standardizing things. You know what I envision is that a lot of this will be envision is that a lot of this will be envision is that a lot of this will be more standardized with the artifactory more standardized with the artifactory more standardized with the artifactory repository. Everything coming out of repository. Everything coming out of repository. Everything coming out of there will know exactly what it is. That there will know exactly what it is. That there will know exactly what it is. That repository will have all the metadata we repository will have all the metadata we repository will have all the metadata we need. That metadata gets to us, right? need. That metadata gets to us, right? need. That metadata gets to us, right? Same thing on the on the vendor on the Same thing on the on the vendor on the Same thing on the on the vendor on the supplier side, right? Uh TPRM will supplier side, right? Uh TPRM will supplier side, right? Uh TPRM will provide us the information in a very provide us the information in a very provide us the information in a very standardized format. We can use that. I standardized format. We can use that. I standardized format. We can use that. I think it'll make at the end of the day, think it'll make at the end of the day, think it'll make at the end of the day, it'll make the the process a lot easier. it'll make the the process a lot easier. it'll make the the process a lot easier. Um, but once we have that all in there, Um, but once we have that all in there, Um, but once we have that all in there, we we are looking and we haven't done it we we are looking and we haven't done it we we are looking and we haven't done it yet. We're looking to also get our yet. We're looking to also get our yet. We're looking to also get our supplier sbombs in there. So, if we can supplier sbombs in there. So, if we can supplier sbombs in there. So, if we can monitor our own, you know, again, think monitor our own, you know, again, think monitor our own, you know, again, think of what I what I said, inventory is an of what I what I said, inventory is an of what I what I said, inventory is an SBOT, right? If we can do our own SBOT, right? If we can do our own SBOT, right? If we can do our own inventory into this process, we can do inventory into this process, we can do inventory into this process, we can do our supplier sbombs into this process, our supplier sbombs into this process, our supplier sbombs into this process, right? So, we can we can look at those, right? So, we can we can look at those, right? So, we can we can look at those, we can look at their open source, we can we can look at their open source, we can we can look at their open source, we can monitor them, we can get ahead of our monitor them, we can get ahead of our monitor them, we can get ahead of our customers. Again, this is all about, you customers. Again, this is all about, you customers. Again, this is all about, you know, being able to tell our customers, know, being able to tell our customers, know, being able to tell our customers, "Yeah, we know what's going on. We know "Yeah, we know what's going on. We know "Yeah, we know what's going on. We know what's in our product, right?" Um, but what's in our product, right?" Um, but what's in our product, right?" Um, but that that that said, we have to apply the VEX, right? said, we have to apply the VEX, right? said, we have to apply the VEX, right? Because we don't want to be we and and Because we don't want to be we and and Because we don't want to be we and and this goes not just for our supplier this goes not just for our supplier this goes not just for our supplier sbombs, but also for our internal sbombs, but also for our internal sbombs, but also for our internal sbombs, right? We're going to want to sbombs, right? We're going to want to sbombs, right? We're going to want to understand understand understand um the vulnerabilities, right? So just um the vulnerabilities, right? So just um the vulnerabilities, right? So just because we get this in there, we have because we get this in there, we have because we get this in there, we have all these vulnerabilities, you know, we all these vulnerabilities, you know, we all these vulnerabilities, you know, we don't we don't necessarily as part of don't we don't necessarily as part of don't we don't necessarily as part of DMP understand what the product teams DMP understand what the product teams DMP understand what the product teams are doing with those vulnerabilities or are doing with those vulnerabilities or are doing with those vulnerabilities or the the suppliers for that matter. We the the suppliers for that matter. We the the suppliers for that matter. We have to we have to be able to know that. have to we have to be able to know that. have to we have to be able to know that. Once we have that, we're opening Once we have that, we're opening Once we have that, we're opening automatically opening um vulnerability automatically opening um vulnerability automatically opening um vulnerability response uh reports. And so the idea is response uh reports. And so the idea is response uh reports. And so the idea is that we're going to automate this that we're going to automate this that we're going to automate this process where as soon as a a newly process where as soon as a a newly process where as soon as a a newly identified vulnerability identified vulnerability identified vulnerability exists, we open a report. It goes to the exists, we open a report. It goes to the exists, we open a report. It goes to the product teams. We understand their product teams. We understand their product teams. We understand their entire inventory. And not only do we entire inventory. And not only do we entire inventory. And not only do we understand their inventory, but we understand their inventory, but we understand their inventory, but we understand different parts of that understand different parts of that understand different parts of that inventory and how they stitch together. inventory and how they stitch together. inventory and how they stitch together. So you may have a supplier. We're going So you may have a supplier. We're going So you may have a supplier. We're going to know that supplier. We're going to to know that supplier. We're going to to know that supplier. We're going to know where they, you know, where their know where they, you know, where their know where they, you know, where their um inventory sits, how it impacts that um inventory sits, how it impacts that um inventory sits, how it impacts that that product. we're going to know um that product. we're going to know um that product. we're going to know um internal components, right? So whether internal components, right? So whether internal components, right? So whether they're publicly known internal they're publicly known internal they're publicly known internal components or shared components, we're components or shared components, we're components or shared components, we're going to understand all those mappings going to understand all those mappings going to understand all those mappings and be able to um provide BUS with and be able to um provide BUS with and be able to um provide BUS with better information to make their process better information to make their process better information to make their process um a lot easier. Uh so as part of the um um a lot easier. Uh so as part of the um um a lot easier. Uh so as part of the um vulnerability response uh process, vulnerability response uh process, vulnerability response uh process, security advisers come out of that, security advisers come out of that, security advisers come out of that, right? We're automating that. We're right? We're automating that. We're right? We're automating that. We're working on the automation of our working on the automation of our working on the automation of our security advisor advisories and as well security advisor advisories and as well security advisor advisories and as well as um VEX in some form and um again this as um VEX in some form and um again this as um VEX in some form and um again this is to provide if we're going to provide is to provide if we're going to provide is to provide if we're going to provide an esbomb and be an esbomb and be an esbomb and be transparent our customers are going to transparent our customers are going to transparent our customers are going to do the same thing most likely they're do the same thing most likely they're do the same thing most likely they're going to bring it into their going to bring it into their going to bring it into their vulnerability management system whatever vulnerability management system whatever vulnerability management system whatever they're going to start out you know they're going to start out you know they're going to start out you know pinging us so I I see this vulnerability pinging us so I I see this vulnerability pinging us so I I see this vulnerability where are you with it so the VEX you where are you with it so the VEX you where are you with it so the VEX you know will handle that um one thing I'm know will handle that um one thing I'm know will handle that um one thing I'm just going to state for the just going to state for the just going to state for the Um, and this is going to cause this Um, and this is going to cause this Um, and this is going to cause this might cause some angst on people's part, might cause some angst on people's part, might cause some angst on people's part, but to me, an ESBOM, when you talk about but to me, an ESBOM, when you talk about but to me, an ESBOM, when you talk about an SBOM, it is a very static document. an SBOM, it is a very static document. an SBOM, it is a very static document. It is the content of the components that It is the content of the components that It is the content of the components that went out the door with that release. went out the door with that release. went out the door with that release. VEX, on the other hand, is more is is a VEX, on the other hand, is more is is a VEX, on the other hand, is more is is a dynamic, right? So, it's a point in time dynamic, right? So, it's a point in time dynamic, right? So, it's a point in time at this minute when I'm asking you for at this minute when I'm asking you for at this minute when I'm asking you for this document, what exists? So, I'm of this document, what exists? So, I'm of this document, what exists? So, I'm of the mindset that two should be separate the mindset that two should be separate the mindset that two should be separate in a pot. Um, but I know that that isn't in a pot. Um, but I know that that isn't in a pot. Um, but I know that that isn't everybody's mindset. Um, and then everybody's mindset. Um, and then everybody's mindset. Um, and then finally, like I said, um, metrics and finally, like I said, um, metrics and finally, like I said, um, metrics and and when, uh, Cassie comes up and talks and when, uh, Cassie comes up and talks and when, uh, Cassie comes up and talks about her pot, she'll talk about how about her pot, she'll talk about how about her pot, she'll talk about how she's using that metric, how how she'll she's using that metric, how how she'll she's using that metric, how how she'll use those metrics in her program. Thank use those metrics in her program. Thank use those metrics in her program. Thank you. Okay, so we talked a little bit you. Okay, so we talked a little bit you. Okay, so we talked a little bit about OSS trustworthiness. I'm not going about OSS trustworthiness. I'm not going about OSS trustworthiness. I'm not going to drain the slide, but the the idea to drain the slide, but the the idea to drain the slide, but the the idea here, I think I did that well on the here, I think I did that well on the here, I think I did that well on the other slide. Um so the idea here is other slide. Um so the idea here is other slide. Um so the idea here is really about you know helping you know really about you know helping you know really about you know helping you know this is all about shifting left right this is all about shifting left right this is all about shifting left right helping product teams make better helping product teams make better helping product teams make better choices by having certain criteria and choices by having certain criteria and choices by having certain criteria and you know these are generally the you know these are generally the you know these are generally the criteria we're looking at so that we can criteria we're looking at so that we can criteria we're looking at so that we can inform we can inform them and give them inform we can inform them and give them inform we can inform them and give them guidance on making better choices guidance on making better choices guidance on making better choices upfront. Um what ends up happening you upfront. Um what ends up happening you upfront. Um what ends up happening you know one of the things I I talked about know one of the things I I talked about know one of the things I I talked about is we have this bill pipeline. Well that is we have this bill pipeline. Well that is we have this bill pipeline. Well that bill pipeline is constantly evolving bill pipeline is constantly evolving bill pipeline is constantly evolving right that's prega and it's being right that's prega and it's being right that's prega and it's being changed. What we want to do is introduce changed. What we want to do is introduce changed. What we want to do is introduce this you know shift left introduce it this you know shift left introduce it this you know shift left introduce it into that process so that as they're into that process so that as they're into that process so that as they're building they're making whatever changes building they're making whatever changes building they're making whatever changes they want because as soon as it goes to they want because as soon as it goes to they want because as soon as it goes to DMP that's GA that is a static um it's DMP that's GA that is a static um it's DMP that's GA that is a static um it's been released it's not going to be been released it's not going to be been released it's not going to be developed anymore. I think, you know, we developed anymore. I think, you know, we developed anymore. I think, you know, we can we can monitor that. We can score can we can monitor that. We can score can we can monitor that. We can score trustworthiness on that and we can help trustworthiness on that and we can help trustworthiness on that and we can help to make better processes, help to to make better processes, help to to make better processes, help to educate, but we also want to, like I educate, but we also want to, like I educate, but we also want to, like I said, shift left. By the time it gets said, shift left. By the time it gets said, shift left. By the time it gets there, it's a fix at that point, right? there, it's a fix at that point, right? there, it's a fix at that point, right? There's there's nothing they can do. I There's there's nothing they can do. I There's there's nothing they can do. I mean, you know, without putting out mean, you know, without putting out mean, you know, without putting out another another another release. Thank you. Um so to sum it up release. Thank you. Um so to sum it up release. Thank you. Um so to sum it up for dependency management this is kind for dependency management this is kind for dependency management this is kind of the places that that we effect um you of the places that that we effect um you of the places that that we effect um you know we got the regulatory we talk about know we got the regulatory we talk about know we got the regulatory we talk about the EO we talk about CRA the the EO we talk about CRA the the EO we talk about CRA the trustworthiness for OSS and the supplier trustworthiness for OSS and the supplier trustworthiness for OSS and the supplier trustworthiness right helping teams to trustworthiness right helping teams to trustworthiness right helping teams to make better choices understanding the make better choices understanding the make better choices understanding the types uh the quality of the components types uh the quality of the components types uh the quality of the components that are being used whether they're that are being used whether they're that are being used whether they're commercial or OSS um you know as I said commercial or OSS um you know as I said commercial or OSS um you know as I said the inventory is there being monitored the inventory is there being monitored the inventory is there being monitored So it's awareness of vulnerabilities So it's awareness of vulnerabilities So it's awareness of vulnerabilities um you know providing transparency to um you know providing transparency to um you know providing transparency to our customers um so so making sure that our customers um so so making sure that our customers um so so making sure that they understand what we're doing the they understand what we're doing the they understand what we're doing the processes we're doing what you know what processes we're doing what you know what processes we're doing what you know what the the automation of the remediation uh the the automation of the remediation uh the the automation of the remediation uh or I'm sorry the the um security or I'm sorry the the um security or I'm sorry the the um security advisories things like that the VEX um advisories things like that the VEX um advisories things like that the VEX um and then finally providing them uh and then finally providing them uh and then finally providing them uh transparency and and you know hopefully transparency and and you know hopefully transparency and and you know hopefully gaining their trust um through the uh uh gaining their trust um through the uh uh gaining their trust um through the uh uh dist distribution of dist distribution of dist distribution of esbombs. I think that's it for me. So esbombs. I think that's it for me. So esbombs. I think that's it for me. So I'm going to hand it over to you. Thanks I'm going to hand it over to you. Thanks I'm going to hand it over to you. Thanks Trisha. So as Trisha alluded to um in Trisha. So as Trisha alluded to um in Trisha. So as Trisha alluded to um in today's interconnected world, managing today's interconnected world, managing today's interconnected world, managing risks uh from external suppliers and risks uh from external suppliers and risks uh from external suppliers and partners is crucial for maintaining partners is crucial for maintaining partners is crucial for maintaining robust product security. Uh as well robust product security. Uh as well robust product security. Uh as well effective thirdparty risk management effective thirdparty risk management effective thirdparty risk management practices are essential uh to support practices are essential uh to support practices are essential uh to support regulatory compliance. uh thirdparty regulatory compliance. uh thirdparty regulatory compliance. uh thirdparty suppliers and partners can introduce suppliers and partners can introduce suppliers and partners can introduce vulnerabilities into the ecosystem when vulnerabilities into the ecosystem when vulnerabilities into the ecosystem when our products incorporate or consume our products incorporate or consume our products incorporate or consume their components. So to safeguard their components. So to safeguard their components. So to safeguard against these potential threats, vendors against these potential threats, vendors against these potential threats, vendors within the ecosystem must conduct due within the ecosystem must conduct due within the ecosystem must conduct due diligence in vetting the maturity of the diligence in vetting the maturity of the diligence in vetting the maturity of the component suppliers vulnerability component suppliers vulnerability component suppliers vulnerability remediation and disclosure activities. remediation and disclosure activities. remediation and disclosure activities. Regular risk assessments and continuous Regular risk assessments and continuous Regular risk assessments and continuous monitoring are vital to identify and monitoring are vital to identify and monitoring are vital to identify and mitigate these vulnerabilities. So we mitigate these vulnerabilities. So we mitigate these vulnerabilities. So we intend to hold our suppliers and intend to hold our suppliers and intend to hold our suppliers and partners to the same rigorous standards partners to the same rigorous standards partners to the same rigorous standards that we hold ourselves to uh so that we that we hold ourselves to uh so that we that we hold ourselves to uh so that we can ensure adher ensure adherence to can ensure adher ensure adherence to can ensure adher ensure adherence to those higher security standards uh and those higher security standards uh and those higher security standards uh and thereby protect the overall ecosystem. thereby protect the overall ecosystem. thereby protect the overall ecosystem. Excellent. Excellent. Excellent. So Trisha mentioned supplier So Trisha mentioned supplier So Trisha mentioned supplier trustworthiness. So these next couple trustworthiness. So these next couple trustworthiness. So these next couple slides will dig into the pieces that slides will dig into the pieces that slides will dig into the pieces that will pull all that will pull all that will pull all that together. together. together. Um so let's let's take a look at some of Um so let's let's take a look at some of Um so let's let's take a look at some of the processes um that we envision uh to the processes um that we envision uh to the processes um that we envision uh to help vet the suppliers. help vet the suppliers. help vet the suppliers. To ensure that our suppliers meet our To ensure that our suppliers meet our To ensure that our suppliers meet our stringent security standards, we'll stringent security standards, we'll stringent security standards, we'll follow a comprehensive onboarding follow a comprehensive onboarding follow a comprehensive onboarding process. This workflow chart outlines process. This workflow chart outlines process. This workflow chart outlines the key high-level steps the key high-level steps the key high-level steps uh involved in onboarding a supplier uh involved in onboarding a supplier uh involved in onboarding a supplier before we even integrate the components before we even integrate the components before we even integrate the components into our products. The process begins into our products. The process begins into our products. The process begins when our product team identifies the when our product team identifies the when our product team identifies the need to onboard a supplier in order to need to onboard a supplier in order to need to onboard a supplier in order to incorporate that component into their incorporate that component into their incorporate that component into their product. product. product. Next, the supplier completes an inherent Next, the supplier completes an inherent Next, the supplier completes an inherent risk risk risk assessment. This assessment covers assessment. This assessment covers assessment. This assessment covers various aspects. It may include various aspects. It may include various aspects. It may include security, privacy, geopolitical risks security, privacy, geopolitical risks security, privacy, geopolitical risks among others. Uh but it helps us to among others. Uh but it helps us to among others. Uh but it helps us to understand that baseline risk that is understand that baseline risk that is understand that baseline risk that is associated with the supplier. associated with the supplier. associated with the supplier. For product security, the inherent risk For product security, the inherent risk For product security, the inherent risk assessment will trigger a security assessment will trigger a security assessment will trigger a security enhanced due diligence questionnaire. enhanced due diligence questionnaire. enhanced due diligence questionnaire. And this questionnaire will evaluate the And this questionnaire will evaluate the And this questionnaire will evaluate the supplier security posture and supplier security posture and supplier security posture and practices. And it's also aligned with practices. And it's also aligned with practices. And it's also aligned with the NIS cyber security framework and our the NIS cyber security framework and our the NIS cyber security framework and our own internal SDL control catalog. And own internal SDL control catalog. And own internal SDL control catalog. And this ensures that the supplier's this ensures that the supplier's this ensures that the supplier's security measures are robust, security measures are robust, security measures are robust, comprehensive, and aligned with our own comprehensive, and aligned with our own comprehensive, and aligned with our own practices and expectations. Our risk subject matter expectations. Our risk subject matter expectations. Our risk subject matter experts will then review the supplers's experts will then review the supplers's experts will then review the supplers's responses and provide a risk rating to responses and provide a risk rating to responses and provide a risk rating to help us gauge the supplers's overall help us gauge the supplers's overall help us gauge the supplers's overall risk level. And it also informs the risk level. And it also informs the risk level. And it also informs the business for their decision-making business for their decision-making business for their decision-making processes whether or not they want to processes whether or not they want to processes whether or not they want to continue and move forward with the continue and move forward with the continue and move forward with the supplier. If any issues or gaps in the supplier. If any issues or gaps in the supplier. If any issues or gaps in the supplers's practices are supplers's practices are supplers's practices are identified, corrective action plans are identified, corrective action plans are identified, corrective action plans are developed and in some cases they may developed and in some cases they may developed and in some cases they may also be incorporated into the terms and also be incorporated into the terms and also be incorporated into the terms and conditions of that conditions of that conditions of that contract. Alternatively, the business contract. Alternatively, the business contract. Alternatively, the business may also choose to accept the risk. may also choose to accept the risk. may also choose to accept the risk. Finally, we'll set up continuous Finally, we'll set up continuous Finally, we'll set up continuous monitoring based on the supplers's risk monitoring based on the supplers's risk monitoring based on the supplers's risk score. And then this will ensure that score. And then this will ensure that score. And then this will ensure that any emerging risks are identified and any emerging risks are identified and any emerging risks are identified and address to maintain the integrity and address to maintain the integrity and address to maintain the integrity and security of the product. By following security of the product. By following security of the product. By following this onboarding process, we can ensure this onboarding process, we can ensure this onboarding process, we can ensure that our suppliers adhere to those that our suppliers adhere to those that our suppliers adhere to those highest security standards and protect highest security standards and protect highest security standards and protect our product ecosystem and ultimately our our product ecosystem and ultimately our our product ecosystem and ultimately our customers. That is the end goal. So if customers. That is the end goal. So if customers. That is the end goal. So if we go to the next slide, we have vetted we go to the next slide, we have vetted we go to the next slide, we have vetted and onboarded the and onboarded the and onboarded the supplier. So now let's explore how we supplier. So now let's explore how we supplier. So now let's explore how we can ensure can ensure can ensure accountability and continuous monitoring accountability and continuous monitoring accountability and continuous monitoring post post post contract. Once a supplier is onboarded, contract. Once a supplier is onboarded, contract. Once a supplier is onboarded, maintaining accountability and maintaining accountability and maintaining accountability and monitoring their performance and and monitoring their performance and and monitoring their performance and and adherence to the security requirements adherence to the security requirements adherence to the security requirements agreed upon in the contract is essential agreed upon in the contract is essential agreed upon in the contract is essential to maintain those higher standards of to maintain those higher standards of to maintain those higher standards of product security while protecting our product security while protecting our product security while protecting our ecosystem. So this workflow chart ecosystem. So this workflow chart ecosystem. So this workflow chart outlines some of the steps to address outlines some of the steps to address outlines some of the steps to address issues and ensure suppliers adhere to issues and ensure suppliers adhere to issues and ensure suppliers adhere to those security standards. The process those security standards. The process those security standards. The process gets kicked off by the product team when gets kicked off by the product team when gets kicked off by the product team when an issue arises with a security fix. We an issue arises with a security fix. We an issue arises with a security fix. We rely on the supplier to provide that fix rely on the supplier to provide that fix rely on the supplier to provide that fix for the component that we're consuming for the component that we're consuming for the component that we're consuming from them. But sometimes for for various from them. But sometimes for for various from them. But sometimes for for various reasons, they may not deliver the reasons, they may not deliver the reasons, they may not deliver the necessary fix. In those necessary fix. In those necessary fix. In those cases, for level one escalations, the cases, for level one escalations, the cases, for level one escalations, the product team directly contacts the product team directly contacts the product team directly contacts the supplier to address the issue. Delays in supplier to address the issue. Delays in supplier to address the issue. Delays in resolving these issues can lead to resolving these issues can lead to resolving these issues can lead to increased vulnerability exposure which increased vulnerability exposure which increased vulnerability exposure which has the potential to result in breaches has the potential to result in breaches has the potential to result in breaches and compromise uh customer trust. So to and compromise uh customer trust. So to and compromise uh customer trust. So to minimize delays minimize delays minimize delays um we we want to make sure we're driving um we we want to make sure we're driving um we we want to make sure we're driving towards a swift towards a swift towards a swift resolution. If the level one escalation resolution. If the level one escalation resolution. If the level one escalation is is is unsuccessful, the product team can unsuccessful, the product team can unsuccessful, the product team can escalate the issue to the PERT. The PERT escalate the issue to the PERT. The PERT escalate the issue to the PERT. The PERT will attempt a PERT top escalation where will attempt a PERT top escalation where will attempt a PERT top escalation where they'll engage with the suppliers they'll engage with the suppliers they'll engage with the suppliers security team to address the security team to address the security team to address the issue. If the level two escalation is issue. If the level two escalation is issue. If the level two escalation is also unsuccessful, the product team can also unsuccessful, the product team can also unsuccessful, the product team can then escalate the issue to the TPRM then escalate the issue to the TPRM then escalate the issue to the TPRM program, third party risk management program, third party risk management program, third party risk management program. program. program. This step involves coordinated efforts This step involves coordinated efforts This step involves coordinated efforts across the product team, the PERT team, across the product team, the PERT team, across the product team, the PERT team, and the TPRM team. So together, these and the TPRM team. So together, these and the TPRM team. So together, these teams will come together. They'll create teams will come together. They'll create teams will come together. They'll create a vulnerability data report or the a vulnerability data report or the a vulnerability data report or the product team's vice president. product team's vice president. product team's vice president. The report may include details such as The report may include details such as The report may include details such as the agreed upon terms and conditions the agreed upon terms and conditions the agreed upon terms and conditions within the contract, the supplers's risk within the contract, the supplers's risk within the contract, the supplers's risk profile, the specific vulnerability profile, the specific vulnerability profile, the specific vulnerability remediation issue that triggered the remediation issue that triggered the remediation issue that triggered the escalation, and any historical evidence escalation, and any historical evidence escalation, and any historical evidence of previous issues with the of previous issues with the of previous issues with the supplier. The product team will then supplier. The product team will then supplier. The product team will then escalate the issue to their VP, escalate the issue to their VP, escalate the issue to their VP, providing them with the vulnerability providing them with the vulnerability providing them with the vulnerability data report. data report. data report. um for a um for a um for a VPtoVP conversation with the supplier. VPtoVP conversation with the supplier. VPtoVP conversation with the supplier. The VP will communicate the results from The VP will communicate the results from The VP will communicate the results from the engagement detailing the supplier's the engagement detailing the supplier's the engagement detailing the supplier's response and any agreed upon response and any agreed upon response and any agreed upon actions. Depending on the outcome of the actions. Depending on the outcome of the actions. Depending on the outcome of the engagement, the supplier will either engagement, the supplier will either engagement, the supplier will either adhere to the terms and conditions uh adhere to the terms and conditions uh adhere to the terms and conditions uh and provide the necessary effects or and provide the necessary effects or and provide the necessary effects or other actions for resolution may take other actions for resolution may take other actions for resolution may take place and be considered. In some cases, place and be considered. In some cases, place and be considered. In some cases, um, this may include terminating the um, this may include terminating the um, this may include terminating the partnership, but by following this partnership, but by following this partnership, but by following this process, we can ensure that our process, we can ensure that our process, we can ensure that our suppliers remain compliant with our suppliers remain compliant with our suppliers remain compliant with our security standards and address any security standards and address any security standards and address any issues promptly slide. So, we've discussed the slide. So, we've discussed the slide. So, we've discussed the pre-contract phase. We've discussed the pre-contract phase. We've discussed the pre-contract phase. We've discussed the postcontract process. Now let's explore postcontract process. Now let's explore postcontract process. Now let's explore how to leverage the data coming from how to leverage the data coming from how to leverage the data coming from these processes and how we integrate it these processes and how we integrate it these processes and how we integrate it back into the back into the back into the pie. Establishing supplier product pie. Establishing supplier product pie. Establishing supplier product remediation effectiveness key remediation effectiveness key remediation effectiveness key performance indicators uh monitors and performance indicators uh monitors and performance indicators uh monitors and evaluate supplier responsiveness to evaluate supplier responsiveness to evaluate supplier responsiveness to product security issues. When product security issues. When product security issues. When vulnerabilities arise that depend on an vulnerabilities arise that depend on an vulnerabilities arise that depend on an external supplier. We can track several external supplier. We can track several external supplier. We can track several key metrics. key metrics. key metrics. These may include responsiveness to These may include responsiveness to These may include responsiveness to security issues uh by measuring how long security issues uh by measuring how long security issues uh by measuring how long it takes our suppliers to provide a it takes our suppliers to provide a it takes our suppliers to provide a security fix for the dependency from the security fix for the dependency from the security fix for the dependency from the initial contact initial contact initial contact date. Um another one is overall effect date. Um another one is overall effect date. Um another one is overall effect an overall effectiveness percentage. So an overall effectiveness percentage. So an overall effectiveness percentage. So this goes back into the supplier this goes back into the supplier this goes back into the supplier trustworthiness score. This metric trustworthiness score. This metric trustworthiness score. This metric evaluates the overall effectiveness of evaluates the overall effectiveness of evaluates the overall effectiveness of each supplier. um in addressing the each supplier. um in addressing the each supplier. um in addressing the security security security vulnerabilities. Um and finally um vulnerabilities. Um and finally um vulnerabilities. Um and finally um contractual and risk assessment data. So contractual and risk assessment data. So contractual and risk assessment data. So we'll consider whether or not we have a we'll consider whether or not we have a we'll consider whether or not we have a signed contract with a supplier and the signed contract with a supplier and the signed contract with a supplier and the risk rating from the pre-contract risk rating from the pre-contract risk rating from the pre-contract vetting process. And by tracking these vetting process. And by tracking these vetting process. And by tracking these KPIs, we can ensure that our suppliers KPIs, we can ensure that our suppliers KPIs, we can ensure that our suppliers are meeting our product security are meeting our product security are meeting our product security expectations. expectations. expectations. This data which Cassie will go to in This data which Cassie will go to in This data which Cassie will go to in just just a minute uh further uh this just just a minute uh further uh this just just a minute uh further uh this data is crucial for our PERT to data is crucial for our PERT to data is crucial for our PERT to continuously monitor and enhance the continuously monitor and enhance the continuously monitor and enhance the product remediation processes for our product remediation processes for our product remediation processes for our dependencies thereby fostering and and dependencies thereby fostering and and dependencies thereby fostering and and improving the overall vulnerability improving the overall vulnerability improving the overall vulnerability management management management ecosystem. Next ecosystem. Next ecosystem. Next slide. One of the most significant slide. One of the most significant slide. One of the most significant outcomes of effective thirdparty risk outcomes of effective thirdparty risk outcomes of effective thirdparty risk management is increased customer trust. management is increased customer trust. management is increased customer trust. TPRM is a vital component of any product TPRM is a vital component of any product TPRM is a vital component of any product security strategy. By assessing and security strategy. By assessing and security strategy. By assessing and mitigating risks from external suppliers mitigating risks from external suppliers mitigating risks from external suppliers and partners, we can maintain higher and partners, we can maintain higher and partners, we can maintain higher standards of standards of standards of security. Encouraging supplier security. Encouraging supplier security. Encouraging supplier accountability is also crucial. By accountability is also crucial. By accountability is also crucial. By holding thirdparty suppliers to those holding thirdparty suppliers to those holding thirdparty suppliers to those higher security standards, we foster a higher security standards, we foster a higher security standards, we foster a culture of accountability and continuous culture of accountability and continuous culture of accountability and continuous improvement within the product security improvement within the product security improvement within the product security ecosystem. And this approach not only ecosystem. And this approach not only ecosystem. And this approach not only enhances our overall security posture enhances our overall security posture enhances our overall security posture but also ensures that our suppliers are but also ensures that our suppliers are but also ensures that our suppliers are committed to maintaining these committed to maintaining these committed to maintaining these standards. Ensuring that components come standards. Ensuring that components come standards. Ensuring that components come from ensuring that components from from ensuring that components from from ensuring that components from suppliers meet our rigorous security suppliers meet our rigorous security suppliers meet our rigorous security standards is essential for reducing the standards is essential for reducing the standards is essential for reducing the risk of vulnerabilities in our products risk of vulnerabilities in our products risk of vulnerabilities in our products and helps us deliver secure products to and helps us deliver secure products to and helps us deliver secure products to our customers thereby reinforcing their our customers thereby reinforcing their our customers thereby reinforcing their trust in our brand. Ultimately, our trust in our brand. Ultimately, our trust in our brand. Ultimately, our commitment to rigorous TPRM practices commitment to rigorous TPRM practices commitment to rigorous TPRM practices fosters greater confidence among our fosters greater confidence among our fosters greater confidence among our customers. I'll hand it over to customers. I'll hand it over to customers. I'll hand it over to Cassie. All right. Uh, thanks Julia. Um, Cassie. All right. Uh, thanks Julia. Um, Cassie. All right. Uh, thanks Julia. Um, so I'm going to be talking a little bit so I'm going to be talking a little bit so I'm going to be talking a little bit about how as the product security about how as the product security about how as the product security incident response team, we're going to incident response team, we're going to incident response team, we're going to be using some of the outputs of the the be using some of the outputs of the the be using some of the outputs of the the the DMP and TPRM in order to feed it the DMP and TPRM in order to feed it the DMP and TPRM in order to feed it back into our PERT operations. Um, so back into our PERT operations. Um, so back into our PERT operations. Um, so for the folks that maybe haven't gotten for the folks that maybe haven't gotten for the folks that maybe haven't gotten the the wonderful experience of working the the wonderful experience of working the the wonderful experience of working in a product security incident response in a product security incident response in a product security incident response team before, um, essentially what my team before, um, essentially what my team before, um, essentially what my team does is we take in any team does is we take in any team does is we take in any vulnerability reports for any Dell vulnerability reports for any Dell vulnerability reports for any Dell product. It flows through our team. product. It flows through our team. product. It flows through our team. Whether that's found internally, whether Whether that's found internally, whether Whether that's found internally, whether it's found by a security researcher, it's found by a security researcher, it's found by a security researcher, found by by root cause analysis, whether found by by root cause analysis, whether found by by root cause analysis, whether it's a scan, it all is going to flow it's a scan, it all is going to flow it's a scan, it all is going to flow through uh the Dell PERT. Um, and what through uh the Dell PERT. Um, and what through uh the Dell PERT. Um, and what we're really going to be able to do with we're really going to be able to do with we're really going to be able to do with these outputs is start to expand. I these outputs is start to expand. I these outputs is start to expand. I think when we think of traditional PERT, think when we think of traditional PERT, think when we think of traditional PERT, it's really just driving those it's really just driving those it's really just driving those remediations, getting things over to remediations, getting things over to remediations, getting things over to product teams. We're we're we're the product teams. We're we're we're the product teams. We're we're we're the hounders. We're going to come bother you hounders. We're going to come bother you hounders. We're going to come bother you and we're going to ask for our fixes. and we're going to ask for our fixes. and we're going to ask for our fixes. Um, but we're really going to start Um, but we're really going to start Um, but we're really going to start becoming the ultimate consumers, right? becoming the ultimate consumers, right? becoming the ultimate consumers, right? So, when we look at the outputs from So, when we look at the outputs from So, when we look at the outputs from TPRM and from DMP, we're going to be TPRM and from DMP, we're going to be TPRM and from DMP, we're going to be taking in the product software taking in the product software taking in the product software inventories. Uh, we're going to be inventories. Uh, we're going to be inventories. Uh, we're going to be having those vulnerability uh findings having those vulnerability uh findings having those vulnerability uh findings from software composition analysis. from software composition analysis. from software composition analysis. We're going to be able to use the We're going to be able to use the We're going to be able to use the supplier uh security requirement supplier uh security requirement supplier uh security requirement agreements, the supplier sbombs and of agreements, the supplier sbombs and of agreements, the supplier sbombs and of course from our suppliers or advisories course from our suppliers or advisories course from our suppliers or advisories and their VEX statements as and their VEX statements as and their VEX statements as well. So to show a little bit about how well. So to show a little bit about how well. So to show a little bit about how uh we're going to be using these uh we're going to be using these uh we're going to be using these collaterals to help with the PERT collaterals to help with the PERT collaterals to help with the PERT operations, I've mapped this a bit to operations, I've mapped this a bit to operations, I've mapped this a bit to you know our traditional kind of PERT you know our traditional kind of PERT you know our traditional kind of PERT framework. Um so usually in the PERT framework. Um so usually in the PERT framework. Um so usually in the PERT side we kind of bucketize things. You side we kind of bucketize things. You side we kind of bucketize things. You know we discover an issue we we know we discover an issue we we know we discover an issue we we determine whether or not we're impacted determine whether or not we're impacted determine whether or not we're impacted by that issue and triage and analysis. by that issue and triage and analysis. by that issue and triage and analysis. if it's a real issue, we fix it. And of if it's a real issue, we fix it. And of if it's a real issue, we fix it. And of course, once we fix it, we're going to course, once we fix it, we're going to course, once we fix it, we're going to tell you about it so you can uh reduce tell you about it so you can uh reduce tell you about it so you can uh reduce the risk in your own environment. So, the risk in your own environment. So, the risk in your own environment. So, I've kind of split this up across three I've kind of split this up across three I've kind of split this up across three different pillars here. Um so, the first different pillars here. Um so, the first different pillars here. Um so, the first the first line here is talking a bit of the first line here is talking a bit of the first line here is talking a bit of how we're using that open source how we're using that open source how we're using that open source software trustworthiness um in the PERT. software trustworthiness um in the PERT. software trustworthiness um in the PERT. Um so, we're going to have that Um so, we're going to have that Um so, we're going to have that dependency inventory that Trisha is dependency inventory that Trisha is dependency inventory that Trisha is working on alongside the SEA uh results. working on alongside the SEA uh results. working on alongside the SEA uh results. And this is going to allow us to quickly And this is going to allow us to quickly And this is going to allow us to quickly identify vulnerabilities in open source identify vulnerabilities in open source identify vulnerabilities in open source software dependencies. And in the past, software dependencies. And in the past, software dependencies. And in the past, kind of like Trisha was saying where we kind of like Trisha was saying where we kind of like Trisha was saying where we might need to, you know, open up a might need to, you know, open up a might need to, you know, open up a ticket with every every product team to ticket with every every product team to ticket with every every product team to determine if they're affected by determine if they're affected by determine if they're affected by something, we'll now be able to use the something, we'll now be able to use the something, we'll now be able to use the the SEA results to automatically open the SEA results to automatically open the SEA results to automatically open those tickets for the product teams that those tickets for the product teams that those tickets for the product teams that might be affected so that they can do a might be affected so that they can do a might be affected so that they can do a review. Then on the remediation side, review. Then on the remediation side, review. Then on the remediation side, right, now that we have our trusted open right, now that we have our trusted open right, now that we have our trusted open source or at least ones that we think source or at least ones that we think source or at least ones that we think are trustworthy, the product team has a are trustworthy, the product team has a are trustworthy, the product team has a a decision to make. They can either a decision to make. They can either a decision to make. They can either patch it, fork it, replace it, and patch it, fork it, replace it, and patch it, fork it, replace it, and that's of course going to drive us to that's of course going to drive us to that's of course going to drive us to that disclosure pillar. that disclosure pillar. that disclosure pillar. The next one on here is looking a little The next one on here is looking a little The next one on here is looking a little bit more at the the TPRM program. So, bit more at the the TPRM program. So, bit more at the the TPRM program. So, how are we working with our suppliers? how are we working with our suppliers? how are we working with our suppliers? Um, so once we have those supplier Um, so once we have those supplier Um, so once we have those supplier esbombs in the discovery phase, that's esbombs in the discovery phase, that's esbombs in the discovery phase, that's really going to help us map the supplier really going to help us map the supplier really going to help us map the supplier dependency to whatever they're calling dependency to whatever they're calling dependency to whatever they're calling that component back to the product so that component back to the product so that component back to the product so that we know when that supplier lets us that we know when that supplier lets us that we know when that supplier lets us know either through their VEX statements know either through their VEX statements know either through their VEX statements or through an advisory that they're or through an advisory that they're or through an advisory that they're affected by something, we know which affected by something, we know which affected by something, we know which product teams need to go in and take a product teams need to go in and take a product teams need to go in and take a look at it. And then we're also going to look at it. And then we're also going to look at it. And then we're also going to be able to use that to have visibility be able to use that to have visibility be able to use that to have visibility into the supplier software allowing us into the supplier software allowing us into the supplier software allowing us to do assessment beyond just that to do assessment beyond just that to do assessment beyond just that initial initial initial impact. And then of course remediation. impact. And then of course remediation. impact. And then of course remediation. The supplier sbombs help us identify The supplier sbombs help us identify The supplier sbombs help us identify what are the affected dependencies so we what are the affected dependencies so we what are the affected dependencies so we know which ones to know which ones to know which ones to update. On the last line here looking a update. On the last line here looking a update. On the last line here looking a bit more at the suppliers. Um using some bit more at the suppliers. Um using some bit more at the suppliers. Um using some of those supplier risk ratings that that of those supplier risk ratings that that of those supplier risk ratings that that uh TPRM and Julia is going to be putting uh TPRM and Julia is going to be putting uh TPRM and Julia is going to be putting together. Uh we're going to know which together. Uh we're going to know which together. Uh we're going to know which suppliers we need to keep a closer eye suppliers we need to keep a closer eye suppliers we need to keep a closer eye on. you know, are there things that on. you know, are there things that on. you know, are there things that we're finding out about that they maybe we're finding out about that they maybe we're finding out about that they maybe didn't put in their advisory or maybe didn't put in their advisory or maybe didn't put in their advisory or maybe they don't have vex statements yet and they don't have vex statements yet and they don't have vex statements yet and we need to we need to follow those we need to we need to follow those we need to we need to follow those suppliers a bit more closely. Maybe it's suppliers a bit more closely. Maybe it's suppliers a bit more closely. Maybe it's a trusted supplier and we know, you a trusted supplier and we know, you a trusted supplier and we know, you know, what's in their ve statement and know, what's in their ve statement and know, what's in their ve statement and what's coming out in their advisories. what's coming out in their advisories. what's coming out in their advisories. We can trust that and we can quickly We can trust that and we can quickly We can trust that and we can quickly push those off for the product team for push those off for the product team for push those off for the product team for review. Those security supplier review. Those security supplier review. Those security supplier agreements that that Julia was talking agreements that that Julia was talking agreements that that Julia was talking about along well with that escalation about along well with that escalation about along well with that escalation plans really helps put PERT in a where plans really helps put PERT in a where plans really helps put PERT in a where we're not just we're not just hounding, we're not just we're not just hounding, we're not just we're not just hounding, we're not just bothering people the we're not just bothering people the we're not just bothering people the product teams can now come to us and product teams can now come to us and product teams can now come to us and say, "Hey, I'm having an issue. You want say, "Hey, I'm having an issue. You want say, "Hey, I'm having an issue. You want me to fix this? I need the fix for my me to fix this? I need the fix for my me to fix this? I need the fix for my supplier first. And having those uh supplier first. And having those uh supplier first. And having those uh agreements make sure that we have agreements make sure that we have agreements make sure that we have something to stand on when we go to the something to stand on when we go to the something to stand on when we go to the supplier and said, "Hey, you're going to supplier and said, "Hey, you're going to supplier and said, "Hey, you're going to you said you were going to do this. You you said you were going to do this. You you said you were going to do this. You know, we're asking that you do it now, know, we're asking that you do it now, know, we're asking that you do it now, please." please." please." Um and then of course on the remediation Um and then of course on the remediation Um and then of course on the remediation side, those uh supplier security side, those uh supplier security side, those uh supplier security agreements also have the SLAs's. So, you agreements also have the SLAs's. So, you agreements also have the SLAs's. So, you know, what what did you agree to as a know, what what did you agree to as a know, what what did you agree to as a supplier to give us the fixes so that supplier to give us the fixes so that supplier to give us the fixes so that Dell can then give those fixes to our Dell can then give those fixes to our Dell can then give those fixes to our customers. So, again, that really goes customers. So, again, that really goes customers. So, again, that really goes back into that supplier accountability back into that supplier accountability back into that supplier accountability piece. So we're driving for those piece. So we're driving for those piece. So we're driving for those remediations and of course that's going remediations and of course that's going remediations and of course that's going to bring us all of these lead back to to bring us all of these lead back to to bring us all of these lead back to disclosure. Um so once we have that disclosure. Um so once we have that disclosure. Um so once we have that remedy we're going to be able to publish remedy we're going to be able to publish remedy we're going to be able to publish advisories. Our our goal is to do that advisories. Our our goal is to do that advisories. Our our goal is to do that via an API where customers can just pull via an API where customers can just pull via an API where customers can just pull down our our advisories pull in our vex down our our advisories pull in our vex down our our advisories pull in our vex statements and they can very quickly and statements and they can very quickly and statements and they can very quickly and as they mature in a more automated way as they mature in a more automated way as they mature in a more automated way say yes I'm affected no I'm not affected say yes I'm affected no I'm not affected say yes I'm affected no I'm not affected and hopefully get to the point where you and hopefully get to the point where you and hopefully get to the point where you know with with all the collateral priing know with with all the collateral priing know with with all the collateral priing they don't even have to call us anymore they don't even have to call us anymore they don't even have to call us anymore to say am I affected by this to say am I affected by this to say am I affected by this vulnerability. they'll have the vex vulnerability. they'll have the vex vulnerability. they'll have the vex statement and they'll just know and statement and they'll just know and statement and they'll just know and they'll they'll go to lunch whatever they'll they'll go to lunch whatever they'll they'll go to lunch whatever they like to do they can call to say they like to do they can call to say they like to do they can call to say hello um and then the updated inventory hello um and then the updated inventory hello um and then the updated inventory right so making sure that our that um right so making sure that our that um right so making sure that our that um our customerf facing sbombs and supplier our customerf facing sbombs and supplier our customerf facing sbombs and supplier sbombs once something's remediated we sbombs once something's remediated we sbombs once something's remediated we have that new sbomb to reflect what the have that new sbomb to reflect what the have that new sbomb to reflect what the changes changes changes were oh and there's there we are oh we were oh and there's there we are oh we were oh and there's there we are oh we got the vulnerabilities and of course again this vulnerabilities and of course again this vulnerabilities and of course again this all goes back to customer trust you know all goes back to customer trust you know all goes back to customer trust you know we we we're all very passionate about we we we're all very passionate about we we we're all very passionate about security but we really do it so we can security but we really do it so we can security but we really do it so we can protect protect our customers. Um, so protect protect our customers. Um, so protect protect our customers. Um, so what this is going to allow the PERT to what this is going to allow the PERT to what this is going to allow the PERT to do is help the business get to faster do is help the business get to faster do is help the business get to faster and more effective vulnerability and more effective vulnerability and more effective vulnerability response. By leveraging this collateral, response. By leveraging this collateral, response. By leveraging this collateral, um, and using these security requirement um, and using these security requirement um, and using these security requirement agreements, we can quickly identify, agreements, we can quickly identify, agreements, we can quickly identify, assess, and drive alongside the business assess, and drive alongside the business assess, and drive alongside the business to provide fixes to customers more to provide fixes to customers more to provide fixes to customers more quickly. And this increased customer quickly. And this increased customer quickly. And this increased customer transparency and trust. Um, customers transparency and trust. Um, customers transparency and trust. Um, customers really benefit from these machine really benefit from these machine really benefit from these machine readable advisories and from SEAF and readable advisories and from SEAF and readable advisories and from SEAF and VEX. You know, customers that I know VEX. You know, customers that I know VEX. You know, customers that I know Crow is joking, but they don't want to Crow is joking, but they don't want to Crow is joking, but they don't want to call us. they they want to focus on call us. they they want to focus on call us. they they want to focus on their on their job and make sure they're their on their job and make sure they're their on their job and make sure they're getting things moving. And of course, getting things moving. And of course, getting things moving. And of course, stronger security and compliance stronger security and compliance stronger security and compliance assurance. Um, you know, we're doing all assurance. Um, you know, we're doing all assurance. Um, you know, we're doing all of these things because it's the right of these things because it's the right of these things because it's the right thing to do, but it also helps us meet thing to do, but it also helps us meet thing to do, but it also helps us meet those compliance requirements. It's a those compliance requirements. It's a those compliance requirements. It's a win for win for win for everybody. So, with that, we're going to everybody. So, with that, we're going to everybody. So, with that, we're going to transition over into Q&amp;A. Oh yes I do. As a matter of fact um so Oh yes I do. As a matter of fact um so Oh yes I do. As a matter of fact um so TPRM we focused a lot on TPRM we focused a lot on TPRM we focused a lot on supplier and um you know one of the supplier and um you know one of the supplier and um you know one of the things with open source we talk at the things with open source we talk at the things with open source we talk at the component level. Um is there a plan to component level. Um is there a plan to component level. Um is there a plan to get to that level and understand get to that level and understand get to that level and understand trustworthiness at that level component trustworthiness at that level component trustworthiness at that level component version type version type version type Yes, that's the ultimate goal, but we Yes, that's the ultimate goal, but we Yes, that's the ultimate goal, but we have to put the other pieces in place to have to put the other pieces in place to have to put the other pieces in place to get there. So, that's that's what we're get there. So, that's that's what we're get there. So, that's that's what we're doing with this, but we envision getting doing with this, but we envision getting doing with this, but we envision getting to that component level. Should I ask it for you? I'm afraid to Should I ask it for you? I'm afraid to Should I ask it for you? I'm afraid to I could get you up here. Well, I'm gonna I could get you up here. Well, I'm gonna I could get you up here. Well, I'm gonna I'm gonna ask my Discord question first I'm gonna ask my Discord question first I'm gonna ask my Discord question first then. Um, so it's a two-parter. Uh, how then. Um, so it's a two-parter. Uh, how then. Um, so it's a two-parter. Uh, how is Dell working around the static nature is Dell working around the static nature is Dell working around the static nature of the data and sbombs or stated of the data and sbombs or stated of the data and sbombs or stated differently? Is this an effective source differently? Is this an effective source differently? Is this an effective source of information for PERT if the data is of information for PERT if the data is of information for PERT if the data is not always fully up to date? Yeah. Yeah. So Trisha was talking about Yeah. Yeah. So Trisha was talking about Yeah. Yeah. So Trisha was talking about how Aspom was kind of a it's a it's a how Aspom was kind of a it's a it's a how Aspom was kind of a it's a it's a place in time, but it's also important place in time, but it's also important place in time, but it's also important to under know like she was saying, we to under know like she was saying, we to under know like she was saying, we also have access to that inventory, but also have access to that inventory, but also have access to that inventory, but when we're thinking about what customers when we're thinking about what customers when we're thinking about what customers have in their environment, they're going have in their environment, they're going have in their environment, they're going to have what we released, right? So even to have what we released, right? So even to have what we released, right? So even though the SBAM is static, unless if though the SBAM is static, unless if though the SBAM is static, unless if they're on that particular version and they're on that particular version and they're on that particular version and we have the SBA and inventory for that we have the SBA and inventory for that we have the SBA and inventory for that version, the static nature of it is version, the static nature of it is version, the static nature of it is correct, right? But we're updating those correct, right? But we're updating those correct, right? But we're updating those vex statements so that as those vex statements so that as those vex statements so that as those components get new vulnerabilities which components get new vulnerabilities which components get new vulnerabilities which we know is happening all the time, we we know is happening all the time, we we know is happening all the time, we can provide dynamic responses with our can provide dynamic responses with our can provide dynamic responses with our advisories and vex statements. advisories and vex statements. advisories and vex statements. So when I talk about registering So when I talk about registering So when I talk about registering inventory, every product that Dell inventory, every product that Dell inventory, every product that Dell creates for every release, we'll be creates for every release, we'll be creates for every release, we'll be registering their inventory and creating registering their inventory and creating registering their inventory and creating an SBO. So, as a customer updates their an SBO. So, as a customer updates their an SBO. So, as a customer updates their their um software, they go pull a new their um software, they go pull a new their um software, they go pull a new they'll have access to a a corresponding they'll have access to a a corresponding they'll have access to a a corresponding um sbomb to that. I have to finish writing my note or I'll I have to finish writing my note or I'll I have to finish writing my note or I'll forgot what you said. All right. And then uh this guy we know All right. And then uh this guy we know All right. And then uh this guy we know as Cro had this question. Uh Dell's as Cro had this question. Uh Dell's as Cro had this question. Uh Dell's plans to address the CRA's ask the plans to address the CRA's ask the plans to address the CRA's ask the manufacturer supply fixes backup stream. manufacturer supply fixes backup stream. manufacturer supply fixes backup stream. Uh does this inventorying process help Uh does this inventorying process help Uh does this inventorying process help enable that request? Yes. Okay. That one didn't go as planned. Okay. That one didn't go as planned. Okay. That one didn't go as planned. That's all I have. Um just Oh, you want That's all I have. Um just Oh, you want That's all I have. Um just Oh, you want me to ask part two of that? It wasn't me to ask part two of that? It wasn't me to ask part two of that? It wasn't part two. It's a separate question. The one about feelings trustworthiness score for OSS. How does trustworthiness score for OSS. How does trustworthiness score for OSS. How does Dell plan to address critical OSS Dell plan to address critical OSS Dell plan to address critical OSS components that don't meet your minimal components that don't meet your minimal components that don't meet your minimal acceptable bar for risk appetite? Sure. Okay. Um, how does Dell plan to Sure. Okay. Um, how does Dell plan to Sure. Okay. Um, how does Dell plan to address critical OSS components that address critical OSS components that address critical OSS components that don't meet your minimum acceptable bar don't meet your minimum acceptable bar don't meet your minimum acceptable bar for risk appetite? Um, so we talked about the uh trusted Um, so we talked about the uh trusted Um, so we talked about the uh trusted repository, right? Um, that's going to repository, right? Um, that's going to repository, right? Um, that's going to be a BEu function and they're going to be a BEu function and they're going to be a BEu function and they're going to have those gates and control those gates have those gates and control those gates have those gates and control those gates of what risk is acceptable and is not. of what risk is acceptable and is not. of what risk is acceptable and is not. if it gets through to the SCA um there if it gets through to the SCA um there if it gets through to the SCA um there are in the build process there are are in the build process there are are in the build process there are actual gateways there as well so based actual gateways there as well so based actual gateways there as well so based on um vulnerabilities critical high on um vulnerabilities critical high on um vulnerabilities critical high whatever um I I I apologize there's some whatever um I I I apologize there's some whatever um I I I apologize there's some there's some work still going on there there's some work still going on there there's some work still going on there so I think originally it was critical so I think originally it was critical so I think originally it was critical high that they're thinking they may high that they're thinking they may high that they're thinking they may adjust that um it will fail the bill adjust that um it will fail the bill adjust that um it will fail the bill it'll actually fail the bill and go back it'll actually fail the bill and go back it'll actually fail the bill and go back and they have to do something but I and they have to do something but I and they have to do something but I think the end state if we talk about it think the end state if we talk about it think the end state if we talk about it is really that everything's in is really that everything's in is really that everything's in um trusted repository and is being um trusted repository and is being um trusted repository and is being assessed before they're ever pulling it assessed before they're ever pulling it assessed before they're ever pulling it out of there. out of there. out of there. Yeah. And I think a good distinction to Yeah. And I think a good distinction to Yeah. And I think a good distinction to make too on the OS trustworthiness, it's make too on the OS trustworthiness, it's make too on the OS trustworthiness, it's to help the developers make good to help the developers make good to help the developers make good decisions while developing, not decisions while developing, not decisions while developing, not necessarily setting the threshold for necessarily setting the threshold for necessarily setting the threshold for the things we're going to remediate. So the things we're going to remediate. So the things we're going to remediate. So if it's a vulnerability, we're going to if it's a vulnerability, we're going to if it's a vulnerability, we're going to strive to remediate it. Um that that strive to remediate it. Um that that strive to remediate it. Um that that opensource software trustworthiness is opensource software trustworthiness is opensource software trustworthiness is really to help them make the good really to help them make the good really to help them make the good decisions. So we're hopefully either decisions. So we're hopefully either decisions. So we're hopefully either seeing less vulnerabilities or, you seeing less vulnerabilities or, you seeing less vulnerabilities or, you know, using open source with maintainers know, using open source with maintainers know, using open source with maintainers that we know are trying their best to to that we know are trying their best to to that we know are trying their best to to keep things updated. Lisa, do you have a Lisa, do you have a Lisa, do you have a question? Eventually, we plan to provide a product Eventually, we plan to provide a product Eventually, we plan to provide a product 360 view to our 360 view to our 360 view to our executives. So, this executives. So, this executives. So, this dashboard will look at each product from dashboard will look at each product from dashboard will look at each product from the product level and we'll be able to the product level and we'll be able to the product level and we'll be able to see any and all metrics, risks, see any and all metrics, risks, see any and all metrics, risks, compliance for that product all compliance for that product all compliance for that product all consolidated together. consolidated together. consolidated together. the trustworthiness scores that we the trustworthiness scores that we the trustworthiness scores that we talked about will feed into this along talked about will feed into this along talked about will feed into this along with any other any other with any other any other with any other any other metrics. Did I cover it? Okay. All metrics. Did I cover it? Okay. All metrics. Did I cover it? Okay. All right. And then uh since we've got time, right. And then uh since we've got time, right. And then uh since we've got time, I'll ask one more question from Discord. I'll ask one more question from Discord. I'll ask one more question from Discord. This is from Josh A. Uh do you require This is from Josh A. Uh do you require This is from Josh A. Uh do you require sbombs leverage source-based SCA or do sbombs leverage source-based SCA or do sbombs leverage source-based SCA or do you accept binary? you accept binary? you accept binary? So um this is way off in the future. So So um this is way off in the future. So So um this is way off in the future. So right now we are doing source based um right now we are doing source based um right now we are doing source based um inventories. Uh the eventuality my plan inventories. Uh the eventuality my plan inventories. Uh the eventuality my plan longterm is to try to get to a point longterm is to try to get to a point longterm is to try to get to a point where we're we're correlating that where we're we're correlating that where we're we're correlating that source inventory against the binary source inventory against the binary source inventory against the binary inventory or the the inventory produced inventory or the the inventory produced inventory or the the inventory produced as a binary scan. um so that we can we as a binary scan. um so that we can we as a binary scan. um so that we can we can again if you go back to what I said can again if you go back to what I said can again if you go back to what I said earlier we check for quality based on earlier we check for quality based on earlier we check for quality based on the document and what the fields that the document and what the fields that the document and what the fields that are included and things like that but we are included and things like that but we are included and things like that but we can't check to make sure everything's can't check to make sure everything's can't check to make sure everything's there right we we we can't check comp at there right we we we can't check comp at there right we we we can't check comp at the component level what we're hoping is the component level what we're hoping is the component level what we're hoping is or you know what our goal is or you know what our goal is or you know what our goal is it and it's it's a while out it's it and it's it's a while out it's it and it's it's a while out it's probably at least a three-year plan for probably at least a three-year plan for probably at least a three-year plan for me is to look at the binary compare that me is to look at the binary compare that me is to look at the binary compare that to what's being produced for the to what's being produced for the to what's being produced for the inventory and be able to find inventory and be able to find inventory and be able to find differences and have it addressed. Does differences and have it addressed. Does differences and have it addressed. Does that answer the question? I think it that answer the question? I think it that answer the question? I think it does. does. does. All right. Any more questions in the in All right. Any more questions in the in All right. Any more questions in the in the room? the room? the room? All right, Steve, take us away. Right. All right, Steve, take us away. Right. All right, Steve, take us away. Right. Thanks. Let's a big round of applause Thanks. Let's a big round of applause Thanks. Let's a big round of applause for Julia, Cassie, and and Patricia.
