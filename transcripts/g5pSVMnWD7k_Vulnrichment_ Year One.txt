So before we do jump into Vul Richmond, So before we do jump into Vul Richmond, So before we do jump into Vul Richmond, I'm going to be that person that wants I'm going to be that person that wants I'm going to be that person that wants to contextualize it uh with a little bit to contextualize it uh with a little bit to contextualize it uh with a little bit of like a SISA framing. I promise you I of like a SISA framing. I promise you I of like a SISA framing. I promise you I will not show you an org chart. I will not show you an org chart. I will not show you an org chart. I promise you I will not try to talk to promise you I will not try to talk to promise you I will not try to talk to you about how my organization is you about how my organization is you about how my organization is structured. Um I know we we don't love structured. Um I know we we don't love structured. Um I know we we don't love it when people do that and I'm not going it when people do that and I'm not going it when people do that and I'm not going to um I'm not going to fall into that to um I'm not going to fall into that to um I'm not going to fall into that trap. I'm going to endeavor to tell you trap. I'm going to endeavor to tell you trap. I'm going to endeavor to tell you something interesting about the history something interesting about the history something interesting about the history history of SISA. So as you can see here history of SISA. So as you can see here history of SISA. So as you can see here um in CISA within the cyber security um in CISA within the cyber security um in CISA within the cyber security division and inside of the vulnerability division and inside of the vulnerability division and inside of the vulnerability management subdivision specifically our management subdivision specifically our management subdivision specifically our mission is to reduce the prevalence and mission is to reduce the prevalence and mission is to reduce the prevalence and impact of vulnerabilities across the impact of vulnerabilities across the impact of vulnerabilities across the federal enterprise. If you consume any federal enterprise. If you consume any federal enterprise. If you consume any of CIS's products you will see that um of CIS's products you will see that um of CIS's products you will see that um federal civilian executive branch or FB federal civilian executive branch or FB federal civilian executive branch or FB moniker used quite often. But actually, moniker used quite often. But actually, moniker used quite often. But actually, we don't just care about the FB. We also we don't just care about the FB. We also we don't just care about the FB. We also care about state, local, tribal, and care about state, local, tribal, and care about state, local, tribal, and territorial or SLT governments. And territorial or SLT governments. And territorial or SLT governments. And actually, we don't just care about FB actually, we don't just care about FB actually, we don't just care about FB and SLT. We also care about critical and SLT. We also care about critical and SLT. We also care about critical infrastructure. And I'm sure that many infrastructure. And I'm sure that many infrastructure. And I'm sure that many of you in the audience, I can't see a of you in the audience, I can't see a of you in the audience, I can't see a single one of you. I only see art, which single one of you. I only see art, which single one of you. I only see art, which is exciting. Um, I feel like I'm talking is exciting. Um, I feel like I'm talking is exciting. Um, I feel like I'm talking to art. I'm sure many of you in the to art. I'm sure many of you in the to art. I'm sure many of you in the audience know that when we say critical audience know that when we say critical audience know that when we say critical infrastructure that covers a di diverse infrastructure that covers a di diverse infrastructure that covers a di diverse array of public and private sector array of public and private sector array of public and private sector partners. So we care about FEB SLT partners. So we care about FEB SLT partners. So we care about FEB SLT critical infrastructure partners both critical infrastructure partners both critical infrastructure partners both public and private sector. And when you public and private sector. And when you public and private sector. And when you get right down to it, a lot of our get right down to it, a lot of our get right down to it, a lot of our messaging also ends up um influencing messaging also ends up um influencing messaging also ends up um influencing and being important to even and being important to even and being important to even organizations that fall outside of those organizations that fall outside of those organizations that fall outside of those three spheres. So once you've covered three spheres. So once you've covered three spheres. So once you've covered all of those entities, what's left over? all of those entities, what's left over? all of those entities, what's left over? Well, I don't really know. Um, last year Well, I don't really know. Um, last year Well, I don't really know. Um, last year we had I had a couple of staff give a we had I had a couple of staff give a we had I had a couple of staff give a really good uh talk on the known really good uh talk on the known really good uh talk on the known exploited vulnerabilities catalog and exploited vulnerabilities catalog and exploited vulnerabilities catalog and they were talking exactly about this they were talking exactly about this they were talking exactly about this slide and saying like what exactly is in slide and saying like what exactly is in slide and saying like what exactly is in cis's purview and I think they finally cis's purview and I think they finally cis's purview and I think they finally got down to saying like I might not care got down to saying like I might not care got down to saying like I might not care about your um Wi-Fi connected toothbrush about your um Wi-Fi connected toothbrush about your um Wi-Fi connected toothbrush and just so happens that the other and just so happens that the other and just so happens that the other analyst in the room was a former dentist analyst in the room was a former dentist analyst in the room was a former dentist and she said I care about your and she said I care about your and she said I care about your toothbrush. So we may even care about toothbrush. So we may even care about toothbrush. So we may even care about your toothbrushes. Um, my version of your toothbrushes. Um, my version of your toothbrushes. Um, my version of that is we might not care about your that is we might not care about your that is we might not care about your internet connected uh dishwashers, but internet connected uh dishwashers, but internet connected uh dishwashers, but fun piece of trivia, SISA did actually fun piece of trivia, SISA did actually fun piece of trivia, SISA did actually do disclosure on internet connected do disclosure on internet connected do disclosure on internet connected industrial dishwashers like 10 years industrial dishwashers like 10 years industrial dishwashers like 10 years ago. So, I don't know. We care about a ago. So, I don't know. We care about a ago. So, I don't know. We care about a lot of things. Our mission can seem very lot of things. Our mission can seem very lot of things. Our mission can seem very big, but over the course of, you know, big, but over the course of, you know, big, but over the course of, you know, 10 or 15 years, we've really honed in on 10 or 15 years, we've really honed in on 10 or 15 years, we've really honed in on ways to sort of execute on that mission. ways to sort of execute on that mission. ways to sort of execute on that mission. So what we try to do is we use all the So what we try to do is we use all the So what we try to do is we use all the levers that we have available to us levers that we have available to us levers that we have available to us including um our authorities to address including um our authorities to address including um our authorities to address the current state of things, the current the current state of things, the current the current state of things, the current operational state of things, but also to operational state of things, but also to operational state of things, but also to kind of evolve towards a world where kind of evolve towards a world where kind of evolve towards a world where that technology is secure by design and that technology is secure by design and that technology is secure by design and default. So our responsibilities can default. So our responsibilities can default. So our responsibilities can sometimes feel like everything sometimes feel like everything sometimes feel like everything everywhere all at once, but we have a everywhere all at once, but we have a everywhere all at once, but we have a lot of different ways that we execute lot of different ways that we execute lot of different ways that we execute them. Thank you for going to the next them. Thank you for going to the next them. Thank you for going to the next slide. I'll stay on this slide now. Um, slide. I'll stay on this slide now. Um, slide. I'll stay on this slide now. Um, all right. So, we're going to talk a all right. So, we're going to talk a all right. So, we're going to talk a little bit about how we do that work little bit about how we do that work little bit about how we do that work specifically in like an operational specifically in like an operational specifically in like an operational capacity because that's really what my capacity because that's really what my capacity because that's really what my team does. Um, in support of that huge team does. Um, in support of that huge team does. Um, in support of that huge risk reduction mission, we do and have risk reduction mission, we do and have risk reduction mission, we do and have done for many years different kinds of done for many years different kinds of done for many years different kinds of vulnerability analysis. I used to have a vulnerability analysis. I used to have a vulnerability analysis. I used to have a talking point that said CISA in one form talking point that said CISA in one form talking point that said CISA in one form or another has done coordinated or another has done coordinated or another has done coordinated vulnerability disclosure for a decade, vulnerability disclosure for a decade, vulnerability disclosure for a decade, but actually I've been with SISA for but actually I've been with SISA for but actually I've been with SISA for nearly five years and so my talking nearly five years and so my talking nearly five years and so my talking point is out of date and I think we've point is out of date and I think we've point is out of date and I think we've almost been doing it 15 years. Um, I almost been doing it 15 years. Um, I almost been doing it 15 years. Um, I think our CIS's first official CVD think our CIS's first official CVD think our CIS's first official CVD advisory was like the 2010 2012 time advisory was like the 2010 2012 time advisory was like the 2010 2012 time frame, something like that. So, I think frame, something like that. So, I think frame, something like that. So, I think that's excellent. We've accumulated a that's excellent. We've accumulated a that's excellent. We've accumulated a lot of expertise on our staff and spread lot of expertise on our staff and spread lot of expertise on our staff and spread out across all of the partners that we out across all of the partners that we out across all of the partners that we work with. Um, what's really exciting work with. Um, what's really exciting work with. Um, what's really exciting about it is that we can explore new ways about it is that we can explore new ways about it is that we can explore new ways of kind of doing things. We can really of kind of doing things. We can really of kind of doing things. We can really take that historical context and take that historical context and take that historical context and everything that we've learned over the everything that we've learned over the everything that we've learned over the years and hone in on where we can add years and hone in on where we can add years and hone in on where we can add the most um value. the most um value. the most um value. So we do analysis analysis in support of So we do analysis analysis in support of So we do analysis analysis in support of our coordinated vulnerability disclosure our coordinated vulnerability disclosure our coordinated vulnerability disclosure process which I mentioned before and I process which I mentioned before and I process which I mentioned before and I have these screenshots up here so that have these screenshots up here so that have these screenshots up here so that you don't have to look at either my you don't have to look at either my you don't have to look at either my large face or my bullet points. You have large face or my bullet points. You have large face or my bullet points. You have something exciting to look at but we do something exciting to look at but we do something exciting to look at but we do analysis in support of CVD we have for analysis in support of CVD we have for analysis in support of CVD we have for many years but there's also other things many years but there's also other things many years but there's also other things that we're doing analysis for. Um, you that we're doing analysis for. Um, you that we're doing analysis for. Um, you may or may not understand or know this, may or may not understand or know this, may or may not understand or know this, but SISA uh uses the stakeholder but SISA uh uses the stakeholder but SISA uh uses the stakeholder specific vulnerability categorization or specific vulnerability categorization or specific vulnerability categorization or SSVC framework to score every new CVE um SSVC framework to score every new CVE um SSVC framework to score every new CVE um to prioritize essentially SISA's to prioritize essentially SISA's to prioritize essentially SISA's response to vulnerabilities across the response to vulnerabilities across the response to vulnerabilities across the federal civilian executive branch federal civilian executive branch federal civilian executive branch agencies. that scoring process requires agencies. that scoring process requires agencies. that scoring process requires um a lot of analysis and expertise um a lot of analysis and expertise um a lot of analysis and expertise behind the scenes that maybe um you know behind the scenes that maybe um you know behind the scenes that maybe um you know we are tracking and collecting and have we are tracking and collecting and have we are tracking and collecting and have been for several years. Uh we also have been for several years. Uh we also have been for several years. Uh we also have the known exploited vulnerabilities or the known exploited vulnerabilities or the known exploited vulnerabilities or Kev catalog the beloved um you know used Kev catalog the beloved um you know used Kev catalog the beloved um you know used by many Kev catalog uh to which of by many Kev catalog uh to which of by many Kev catalog uh to which of course the federal civilian executive course the federal civilian executive course the federal civilian executive branch agencies are held accountable branch agencies are held accountable branch agencies are held accountable through the binding operational through the binding operational through the binding operational directive or baud 2201 and then we're directive or baud 2201 and then we're directive or baud 2201 and then we're trying other things like providing our trying other things like providing our trying other things like providing our vulnerability advisories in a machine vulnerability advisories in a machine vulnerability advisories in a machine readable format called the common readable format called the common readable format called the common security advisory framework or CESAF security advisory framework or CESAF security advisory framework or CESAF framework which we've been doing since framework which we've been doing since framework which we've been doing since about about about 2022. Um so we even before sort of 2022. Um so we even before sort of 2022. Um so we even before sort of conceptualizing vulnerrichment we had conceptualizing vulnerrichment we had conceptualizing vulnerrichment we had this maybe goal or ethos of taking all this maybe goal or ethos of taking all this maybe goal or ethos of taking all this stuff all this analysis that we've this stuff all this analysis that we've this stuff all this analysis that we've been producing to execute that been producing to execute that been producing to execute that operational um mission to execute our operational um mission to execute our operational um mission to execute our role as an operational lead for role as an operational lead for role as an operational lead for vulnerability response. taking all that vulnerability response. taking all that vulnerability response. taking all that information, putting it together, and information, putting it together, and information, putting it together, and basically democratizing it as a public basically democratizing it as a public basically democratizing it as a public service, providing as much of it as we service, providing as much of it as we service, providing as much of it as we could that isn't like privileged could that isn't like privileged could that isn't like privileged information to the public in some kind information to the public in some kind information to the public in some kind of easily consumable format um for you of easily consumable format um for you of easily consumable format um for you all to benefit with. Do with as you all to benefit with. Do with as you all to benefit with. Do with as you please essentially. So that kind of sets please essentially. So that kind of sets please essentially. So that kind of sets the stage for vulnerrichment. And I the stage for vulnerrichment. And I the stage for vulnerrichment. And I I thank you for indulging my history I thank you for indulging my history I thank you for indulging my history lesson. I know that's not always the lesson. I know that's not always the lesson. I know that's not always the most fun, but I do think it's important most fun, but I do think it's important most fun, but I do think it's important to contextualize the the slides that to contextualize the the slides that to contextualize the the slides that we'll go over later. And Art, of course, we'll go over later. And Art, of course, we'll go over later. And Art, of course, is going to do our deep dive, but I'll is going to do our deep dive, but I'll is going to do our deep dive, but I'll start here with our vulnerrichment start here with our vulnerrichment start here with our vulnerrichment design goals. I covered some of these design goals. I covered some of these design goals. I covered some of these already, but I like how this is mapped already, but I like how this is mapped already, but I like how this is mapped out because you can kind of see how we out because you can kind of see how we out because you can kind of see how we did put thought and planning into did put thought and planning into did put thought and planning into essentially making sure that we really essentially making sure that we really essentially making sure that we really stayed true to those original design stayed true to those original design stayed true to those original design goals. So, first and foremost, providing goals. So, first and foremost, providing goals. So, first and foremost, providing useful data for vulnerability useful data for vulnerability useful data for vulnerability management. We're doing all of this management. We're doing all of this management. We're doing all of this right behind the scenes already. And and right behind the scenes already. And and right behind the scenes already. And and last year and and actually in the fall last year and and actually in the fall last year and and actually in the fall in the fall of the previous year, we had in the fall of the previous year, we had in the fall of the previous year, we had begun to think about how we could begun to think about how we could begun to think about how we could provide that useful data that we're provide that useful data that we're provide that useful data that we're already producing and maybe holding already producing and maybe holding already producing and maybe holding internally to the public. Um, we did not internally to the public. Um, we did not internally to the public. Um, we did not want to reinvent the wheel. We did not want to reinvent the wheel. We did not want to reinvent the wheel. We did not want to create something big and want to create something big and want to create something big and expensive and clunky that was difficult expensive and clunky that was difficult expensive and clunky that was difficult to fix when it was going off the rails. to fix when it was going off the rails. to fix when it was going off the rails. We wanted to to leverage those existing We wanted to to leverage those existing We wanted to to leverage those existing capabilities. So essentially the idea capabilities. So essentially the idea capabilities. So essentially the idea was to take that CISA vulnerability was to take that CISA vulnerability was to take that CISA vulnerability triage and anal analysis that we were triage and anal analysis that we were triage and anal analysis that we were doing internally as part of our doing internally as part of our doing internally as part of our operational response role, feed it into operational response role, feed it into operational response role, feed it into the CVE ecosystem with essentially what the CVE ecosystem with essentially what the CVE ecosystem with essentially what was already under production, the CVE was already under production, the CVE was already under production, the CVE program's authorized data publisher or program's authorized data publisher or program's authorized data publisher or ADP capability. Um, I believe those, ADP capability. Um, I believe those, ADP capability. Um, I believe those, well, I don't have a good timeline. Art well, I don't have a good timeline. Art well, I don't have a good timeline. Art might, but I believe those talks were might, but I believe those talks were might, but I believe those talks were happening for a couple of years before happening for a couple of years before happening for a couple of years before we even really said, "Okay, let's let's we even really said, "Okay, let's let's we even really said, "Okay, let's let's do this thing." Um, it was really do this thing." Um, it was really do this thing." Um, it was really important to us to stay transparent. important to us to stay transparent. important to us to stay transparent. You're going to hear transparency and You're going to hear transparency and You're going to hear transparency and transparent and references to our public transparent and references to our public transparent and references to our public um, you know, our public uh, dis dispute um, you know, our public uh, dis dispute um, you know, our public uh, dis dispute resolution process um, all throughout resolution process um, all throughout resolution process um, all throughout this this presentation because that is this this presentation because that is this this presentation because that is truly very important to the team behind truly very important to the team behind truly very important to the team behind full enrichment. um in order to sort of full enrichment. um in order to sort of full enrichment. um in order to sort of maintain that transparency um in maintain that transparency um in maintain that transparency um in implementation, we've used a public implementation, we've used a public implementation, we've used a public repository. Our documentation is public. repository. Our documentation is public. repository. Our documentation is public. We resolve issues and have change We resolve issues and have change We resolve issues and have change requests all done publicly through um requests all done publicly through um requests all done publicly through um that repository. And then finally, I'll that repository. And then finally, I'll that repository. And then finally, I'll talk a little bit about accuracy. We talk a little bit about accuracy. We talk a little bit about accuracy. We will talk a little bit about accuracy as will talk a little bit about accuracy as will talk a little bit about accuracy as we go through the slides. Um we go through the slides. Um we go through the slides. Um essentially, this isn't an audit essentially, this isn't an audit essentially, this isn't an audit capability. It was never intended to be capability. It was never intended to be capability. It was never intended to be an audit capability. Um we don't want to an audit capability. Um we don't want to an audit capability. Um we don't want to overwrite what the CNA says. We're overwrite what the CNA says. We're overwrite what the CNA says. We're filling in gaps. If there are gaps, we filling in gaps. If there are gaps, we filling in gaps. If there are gaps, we fill them in. if the CNA comes back and fill them in. if the CNA comes back and fill them in. if the CNA comes back and would like to change them, it is very would like to change them, it is very would like to change them, it is very easy to make a change request. Um, and easy to make a change request. Um, and easy to make a change request. Um, and we've been super responsive to those, we've been super responsive to those, we've been super responsive to those, which Art will show you in a few which Art will show you in a few which Art will show you in a few minutes. So, before I move on, I'm going minutes. So, before I move on, I'm going minutes. So, before I move on, I'm going to pass it to you, Art, and you can to pass it to you, Art, and you can to pass it to you, Art, and you can stick to this slide, or you can move on stick to this slide, or you can move on stick to this slide, or you can move on to the next slide if you want to. No, to the next slide if you want to. No, to the next slide if you want to. No, thanks, Lindsay. I'm going to just say a thanks, Lindsay. I'm going to just say a thanks, Lindsay. I'm going to just say a a bit about accuracy. Um, some people a bit about accuracy. Um, some people a bit about accuracy. Um, some people involved in volrichment involved in volrichment involved in volrichment um have a just can't let it let an um have a just can't let it let an um have a just can't let it let an argument go. So, if someone wants to argument go. So, if someone wants to argument go. So, if someone wants to argue about CVSS, as I'll show later, argue about CVSS, as I'll show later, argue about CVSS, as I'll show later, I'll I'll take debate and I will I will I'll I'll take debate and I will I will I'll I'll take debate and I will I will argue with you. Um, we had a lot we had argue with you. Um, we had a lot we had argue with you. Um, we had a lot we had guidance though. We had a policy uh very guidance though. We had a policy uh very guidance though. We had a policy uh very well thought out that was simply stop. well thought out that was simply stop. well thought out that was simply stop. No, don't don't argue. We're not going No, don't don't argue. We're not going No, don't don't argue. We're not going to have an accuracy fight. We're not to have an accuracy fight. We're not to have an accuracy fight. We're not going to have an audit fight. The CNA going to have an audit fight. The CNA going to have an audit fight. The CNA says X. That's what goes in. VR says X. That's what goes in. VR says X. That's what goes in. VR enrichment steps aside. The CNA provided enrichment steps aside. The CNA provided enrichment steps aside. The CNA provided information and and that's the answer. information and and that's the answer. information and and that's the answer. um engaging in these CVSS and CWE and um engaging in these CVSS and CWE and um engaging in these CVSS and CWE and CPE fights is kind of a waste of almost CPE fights is kind of a waste of almost CPE fights is kind of a waste of almost everyone's time after a certain point everyone's time after a certain point everyone's time after a certain point and that certain point is like 4 seconds and that certain point is like 4 seconds and that certain point is like 4 seconds into it. So um we'll have an example at into it. So um we'll have an example at into it. So um we'll have an example at the end but the end but the end but just the the choice it's it's not we're just the the choice it's it's not we're just the the choice it's it's not we're trying not to be accurate. It's simply trying not to be accurate. It's simply trying not to be accurate. It's simply that we're not going to engage in that we're not going to engage in that we're not going to engage in perfection at this level of work. It's perfection at this level of work. It's perfection at this level of work. It's it's not actually helpful to everyone it's not actually helpful to everyone it's not actually helpful to everyone downstream. Um this has been covered a downstream. Um this has been covered a downstream. Um this has been covered a little bit but you know this is where little bit but you know this is where little bit but you know this is where stuff comes from. SISA is the originator stuff comes from. SISA is the originator stuff comes from. SISA is the originator of SSVC and Kev information, right? That of SSVC and Kev information, right? That of SSVC and Kev information, right? That is internal SISA work that happens. SISA is internal SISA work that happens. SISA is internal SISA work that happens. SISA produces those results and SISA is produces those results and SISA is produces those results and SISA is publishing almost all of it. So that's publishing almost all of it. So that's publishing almost all of it. So that's where that comes from. CVSS and C.WE. where that comes from. CVSS and C.WE. where that comes from. CVSS and C.WE. SISA provides through von enrichment if SISA provides through von enrichment if SISA provides through von enrichment if the CNA did not provide it. And I'm not the CNA did not provide it. And I'm not the CNA did not provide it. And I'm not sure we're perfect on it, but if the CNA sure we're perfect on it, but if the CNA sure we're perfect on it, but if the CNA provides it later, uh, VR enrichment provides it later, uh, VR enrichment provides it later, uh, VR enrichment will back theirs out. Um, additional will back theirs out. Um, additional will back theirs out. Um, additional references. These are just the URLs. references. These are just the URLs. references. These are just the URLs. Uh CNA provides those venrichment Uh CNA provides those venrichment Uh CNA provides those venrichment provides them sometimes a little bit provides them sometimes a little bit provides them sometimes a little bit more now than than we did at the more now than than we did at the more now than than we did at the beginning. Um it's that thing, you know, beginning. Um it's that thing, you know, beginning. Um it's that thing, you know, you've got a I've got my cut buffer is you've got a I've got my cut buffer is you've got a I've got my cut buffer is full of a of a great URL that's obvious full of a of a great URL that's obvious full of a of a great URL that's obvious and one click away from putting in there and one click away from putting in there and one click away from putting in there and helping people. We we stick it in and helping people. We we stick it in and helping people. We we stick it in these days, right? Um CPE, we'll talk these days, right? Um CPE, we'll talk these days, right? Um CPE, we'll talk about a bit more. Um C some few CNAs about a bit more. Um C some few CNAs about a bit more. Um C some few CNAs provide CPE. Von Richmond provided CPE provide CPE. Von Richmond provided CPE provide CPE. Von Richmond provided CPE for eight, nine, 10 months and we for eight, nine, 10 months and we for eight, nine, 10 months and we stopped and we'll discuss that in a stopped and we'll discuss that in a stopped and we'll discuss that in a moment. Um, and the NVD is doing it as moment. Um, and the NVD is doing it as moment. Um, and the NVD is doing it as the NVD sort of always has and continues the NVD sort of always has and continues the NVD sort of always has and continues to. So any CPE is no longer coming from to. So any CPE is no longer coming from to. So any CPE is no longer coming from von Richmond. It's from the CNA directly von Richmond. It's from the CNA directly von Richmond. It's from the CNA directly or uh or NVD. Um, I mentioned the or uh or NVD. Um, I mentioned the or uh or NVD. Um, I mentioned the process is public. There's a lovely process is public. There's a lovely process is public. There's a lovely mermaid chart. I'm very proud of myself. mermaid chart. I'm very proud of myself. mermaid chart. I'm very proud of myself. I switched from graph viz to mermaid. I switched from graph viz to mermaid. I switched from graph viz to mermaid. I'm an internet genius, right? Uh so I'm an internet genius, right? Uh so I'm an internet genius, right? Uh so this is the process. There's nothing this is the process. There's nothing this is the process. There's nothing exciting. SSVC happens. If it's on the exciting. SSVC happens. If it's on the exciting. SSVC happens. If it's on the KEV gets the flag, we inherit the flag. KEV gets the flag, we inherit the flag. KEV gets the flag, we inherit the flag. Um and if CVSS, CWE are missing or a Um and if CVSS, CWE are missing or a Um and if CVSS, CWE are missing or a good reference is missing, it gets good reference is missing, it gets good reference is missing, it gets added. Um of note, the publication is is added. Um of note, the publication is is added. Um of note, the publication is is twofold. This goes back into the CVE twofold. This goes back into the CVE twofold. This goes back into the CVE ecosystem. So there's an a CISA ecosystem. So there's an a CISA ecosystem. So there's an a CISA venrichment ADP container added to and venrichment ADP container added to and venrichment ADP container added to and updated in a CVE record in the official updated in a CVE record in the official updated in a CVE record in the official CVE corpus. Uh there's also a GitHub CVE corpus. Uh there's also a GitHub CVE corpus. Uh there's also a GitHub repo for venrichment, not the CVE repo, repo for venrichment, not the CVE repo, repo for venrichment, not the CVE repo, but uh a separate van enrichment um repo but uh a separate van enrichment um repo but uh a separate van enrichment um repo for the GitHub, sorry, for the for the GitHub, sorry, for the for the GitHub, sorry, for the venrichment venrichment venrichment information. Um here's some numbers, information. Um here's some numbers, information. Um here's some numbers, very basic chart, but this is simply very basic chart, but this is simply very basic chart, but this is simply right up and to the right over time. Um right up and to the right over time. Um right up and to the right over time. Um very briefly, the blue line is just very briefly, the blue line is just very briefly, the blue line is just published published published CVEes. Uh orange is venrichment CVEes. Uh orange is venrichment CVEes. Uh orange is venrichment triaging. And you'll notice in the triaging. And you'll notice in the triaging. And you'll notice in the beginning we had a we had a backlog to beginning we had a we had a backlog to beginning we had a we had a backlog to overcome and that eventually happened. overcome and that eventually happened. overcome and that eventually happened. Um, green is va enrichment enrichment. Um, green is va enrichment enrichment. Um, green is va enrichment enrichment. So, triage is we got the record in, we So, triage is we got the record in, we So, triage is we got the record in, we SSVCed it, we took a look at it. Um, if SSVCed it, we took a look at it. Um, if SSVCed it, we took a look at it. Um, if it already had the enrichment things in it already had the enrichment things in it already had the enrichment things in there, CBSS, CWE enrichment is done. If there, CBSS, CWE enrichment is done. If there, CBSS, CWE enrichment is done. If it didn't have them, we had to add them. it didn't have them, we had to add them. it didn't have them, we had to add them. So, very roughly the green and the So, very roughly the green and the So, very roughly the green and the dotted red line, which is did the CNA dotted red line, which is did the CNA dotted red line, which is did the CNA provide the information, roughly add up provide the information, roughly add up provide the information, roughly add up to the to the orange. Um, of note, those to the to the orange. Um, of note, those to the to the orange. Um, of note, those green and red dotted lines cross, and I green and red dotted lines cross, and I green and red dotted lines cross, and I didn't do enough real analysis to know didn't do enough real analysis to know didn't do enough real analysis to know if this is true, but I'm going to say it if this is true, but I'm going to say it if this is true, but I'm going to say it anyway. Um, that is about the time that anyway. Um, that is about the time that anyway. Um, that is about the time that the CVE program uh un not didn't the CVE program uh un not didn't the CVE program uh un not didn't require, it wasn't a rules change or a require, it wasn't a rules change or a require, it wasn't a rules change or a requirement, but started to really requirement, but started to really requirement, but started to really advocate a lot more strongly for, hey, advocate a lot more strongly for, hey, advocate a lot more strongly for, hey, CNAs, would you please provide this CNAs, would you please provide this CNAs, would you please provide this information from the source as you're information from the source as you're information from the source as you're creating your CVE records? So, it's creating your CVE records? So, it's creating your CVE records? So, it's possible that that that line crossing possible that that that line crossing possible that that that line crossing there is the effect of uh that marketing there is the effect of uh that marketing there is the effect of uh that marketing campaign to uh add more to your CVE campaign to uh add more to your CVE campaign to uh add more to your CVE record. Uh no, the question is does the the CVE Uh no, the question is does the the CVE Uh no, the question is does the the CVE services require CVS and CWE? They do services require CVS and CWE? They do services require CVS and CWE? They do not. You can if you're if you're a CNA, You can if you're if you're a CNA, You can if you're if you're a CNA, sorry, the question is, does the MITER sorry, the question is, does the MITER sorry, the question is, does the MITER website support uh CVSS and CWE? Um, if website support uh CVSS and CWE? Um, if website support uh CVSS and CWE? Um, if you're a CNA working through the CVE you're a CNA working through the CVE you're a CNA working through the CVE services, yes, you can. Yeah, if you are using the web form and Yeah, if you are using the web form and Yeah, if you are using the web form and you're not a CNA, um, the MITER CNA LR you're not a CNA, um, the MITER CNA LR you're not a CNA, um, the MITER CNA LR decides what to do. I've seen a couple decides what to do. I've seen a couple decides what to do. I've seen a couple of times recently they've they've added of times recently they've they've added of times recently they've they've added CVSS in CW, but it's not very CVSS in CW, but it's not very CVSS in CW, but it's not very common. Anybody in Yes, Chris. Is that common. Anybody in Yes, Chris. Is that common. Anybody in Yes, Chris. Is that what I said is correct? Confirming with what I said is correct? Confirming with what I said is correct? Confirming with somebody who knows for real. So, um somebody who knows for real. So, um somebody who knows for real. So, um yeah. yeah. yeah. Okay. Uh transparency, transparency, Okay. Uh transparency, transparency, Okay. Uh transparency, transparency, transparency. Lindsay mentioned it. I'm transparency. Lindsay mentioned it. I'm transparency.

All of our there. All of our there. All of our enrichment is there. Um so and you can enrichment is there. Um so and you can enrichment is there. Um so and you can you can and people have issued PR you you can and people have issued PR you you can and people have issued PR you know send us PRs and and pull requests know send us PRs and and pull requests know send us PRs and and pull requests and uh issues and we deal with them and and uh issues and we deal with them and and uh issues and we deal with them and if you're if you can figure out that you if you're if you can figure out that you if you're if you can figure out that you know it wasn't the stuff we did but the know it wasn't the stuff we did but the know it wasn't the stuff we did but the stuff the CNA did you got to talk to the stuff the CNA did you got to talk to the stuff the CNA did you got to talk to the upstream but um we do what we can here. upstream but um we do what we can here. upstream but um we do what we can here. Um so at the moment we have two open Um so at the moment we have two open Um so at the moment we have two open issues which I should have closed right issues which I should have closed right issues which I should have closed right before so I could have gotten a zero. before so I could have gotten a zero. before so I could have gotten a zero. They're just sitting open. They're not They're just sitting open. They're not They're just sitting open. They're not they're not material. They're important they're not material. They're important they're not material. They're important issues, but they're not anything that's issues, but they're not anything that's issues, but they're not anything that's going to get fixed soon. So, they're going to get fixed soon. So, they're going to get fixed soon. So, they're sort of OBBE. Um, all pull requests are sort of OBBE. Um, all pull requests are sort of OBBE. Um, all pull requests are closed. Pull requests don't sort of closed. Pull requests don't sort of closed. Pull requests don't sort of exactly work because the upstream data exactly work because the upstream data exactly work because the upstream data source is somewhere else entirely, but source is somewhere else entirely, but source is somewhere else entirely, but we try to click accept to give people we try to click accept to give people we try to click accept to give people their GitHub internet points and then their GitHub internet points and then their GitHub internet points and then make sure the changes are synced on the make sure the changes are synced on the make sure the changes are synced on the back end.

Um, days open was six and a half and uh you may not have known this but and uh you may not have known this but and uh you may not have known this but from the GitHub API you can pull part of from the GitHub API you can pull part of from the GitHub API you can pull part of the JSON you get back is did you have or the JSON you get back is did you have or the JSON you get back is did you have or win a CVSs argument is in there and uh win a CVSs argument is in there and uh win a CVSs argument is in there and uh we are 0 for 0 for two I think. So um we are 0 for 0 for two I think. So um we are 0 for 0 for two I think. So um that's a great great feature GitHub has. that's a great great feature GitHub has. that's a great great feature GitHub has. I didn't know they had that. Um, we I didn't know they had that. Um, we I didn't know they had that. Um, we tried to uh properly label all of the tried to uh properly label all of the tried to uh properly label all of the PRs and issues and we weren't perfect, PRs and issues and we weren't perfect, PRs and issues and we weren't perfect, but we did a pretty good job. So, this but we did a pretty good job. So, this but we did a pretty good job. So, this is the, you know, the tag cloud and is the, you know, the tag cloud and is the, you know, the tag cloud and there's some numbers about the things we there's some numbers about the things we there's some numbers about the things we got in there. Um, you know, you'll see got in there. Um, you know, you'll see got in there. Um, you know, you'll see CPE is pretty big. Um, bug is basically CPE is pretty big.

Please correct it. Gets with the data. Please correct it. Gets with the data. Please correct it. Gets the bug label. Um this is the the bug label. Um this is the the bug label. Um this is the distribution of of the uh labels we distribution of of the uh labels we distribution of of the uh labels we picked and um how many roughly we picked and um how many roughly we picked and um how many roughly we got. Um so year one we've learned some got. Um so year one we've learned some got. Um so year one we've learned some stuff. It turns out we did pay attention stuff. It turns out we did pay attention stuff. It turns out we did pay attention and we learned some things. Um and this and we learned some things. Um and this and we learned some things. Um and this is where I sort of talked about why art is where I sort of talked about why art is where I sort of talked about why art should not argue CVSS with anyone but should not argue CVSS with anyone but should not argue CVSS with anyone but you know we got a got an issue in here. you know we got a got an issue in here. you know we got a got an issue in here. here might have been a PR and I believe here might have been a PR and I believe here might have been a PR and I believe this person um is the indep as as as this person um is the indep as as as this person um is the indep as as as written here is the independent review written here is the independent review written here is the independent review conducted of this CVE. I think this conducted of this CVE. I think this conducted of this CVE. I think this person may have been the researcher. I'm person may have been the researcher. I'm person may have been the researcher. I'm not positive. Um but they had a strong not positive. Um but they had a strong not positive. Um but they had a strong opinion and had done some work and were opinion and had done some work and were opinion and had done some work and were were very helpful and contributed. Um so were very helpful and contributed. Um so were very helpful and contributed. Um so you know this person suggested a you know this person suggested a you know this person suggested a different CVSs score and there's like 10 different CVSs score and there's like 10 different CVSs score and there's like 10 or 11 comments and I decided you know or 11 comments and I decided you know or 11 comments and I decided you know okay yes your score wins but you're okay yes your score wins but you're okay yes your score wins but you're still getting a paragraph from me. So, still getting a paragraph from me. So, still getting a paragraph from me. So, um, this allows me to feel better about um, this allows me to feel better about um, this allows me to feel better about my argument and not have to actually my argument and not have to actually my argument and not have to actually fight it. Um, but you know, if you're in fight it. Um, but you know, if you're in fight it. Um, but you know, if you're in if you're involved in CVSS, scoring if you're involved in CVSS, scoring if you're involved in CVSS, scoring libraries is tricky, right? Um, scoring libraries is tricky, right? Um, scoring libraries is tricky, right? Um, scoring cross-ey scripting can be weird. There's cross-ey scripting can be weird. There's cross-ey scripting can be weird. There's a lot of weird issues and that's just a lot of weird issues and that's just a lot of weird issues and that's just how it is. So, you can have a debate and how it is. So, you can have a debate and how it is. So, you can have a debate and no one can win and uh you shouldn't do no one can win and uh you shouldn't do no one can win and uh you shouldn't do too much of that. Um, we learned lessons too much of that. Um, we learned lessons too much of that. Um, we learned lessons about working with the community. Um, about working with the community. Um, about working with the community. Um, this is uh Mr. Badger. This is the curl this is uh Mr. Badger. This is the curl this is uh Mr. Badger. This is the curl the curl guy, Daniel. You can tell from the curl guy, Daniel. You can tell from the curl guy, Daniel. You can tell from his GitHub picture that he means his GitHub picture that he means his GitHub picture that he means business. He's got a great great great business. He's got a great great great business. He's got a great great great snarky smirk on. Um, so and and no snarky smirk on. Um, so and and no snarky smirk on. Um, so and and no offense, he's completely right. Um, Curl offense, he's completely right. Um, Curl offense, he's completely right. Um, Curl publishes stuff. Other people come along publishes stuff. Other people come along publishes stuff. Other people come along and publish CVSS and things and it's it and publish CVSS and things and it's it and publish CVSS and things and it's it looks weird and he's uh in my mind, you looks weird and he's uh in my mind, you looks weird and he's uh in my mind, you know, justifiably not pleased with how know, justifiably not pleased with how know, justifiably not pleased with how that happens. And that happened to us in that happens. And that happened to us in that happens. And that happened to us in von Richmond. So, um, something got von Richmond. So, um, something got von Richmond. So, um, something got published and it got vanriched. uh and published and it got vanriched. uh and published and it got vanriched. uh and he uh you know put in a PR or an issue he uh you know put in a PR or an issue he uh you know put in a PR or an issue and said I don't think so. Um, now the and said I don't think so. Um, now the and said I don't think so. Um, now the cool thing is this happened on a cool thing is this happened on a cool thing is this happened on a Sunday and we didn't we don't actually Sunday and we didn't we don't actually Sunday and we didn't we don't actually have 247 human staff manning a sock have 247 human staff manning a sock have 247 human staff manning a sock monitoring the GitHub repo for issues monitoring the GitHub repo for issues monitoring the GitHub repo for issues involve enrichment but something involve enrichment but something involve enrichment but something happened on Masttodon and one of our happened on Masttodon and one of our happened on Masttodon and one of our teams saw it and signaled me and I teams saw it and signaled me and I teams saw it and signaled me and I happened to be sitting down drinking happened to be sitting down drinking happened to be sitting down drinking coffee reading a book to kids or coffee reading a book to kids or coffee reading a book to kids or something and so I just like opened the something and so I just like opened the something and so I just like opened the laptop took a quick look saw Daniel and laptop took a quick look saw Daniel and laptop took a quick look saw Daniel and Curl spent 15 minutes and fixed it. um Curl spent 15 minutes and fixed it. um Curl spent 15 minutes and fixed it. um and he closed his comment hours later on and he closed his comment hours later on and he closed his comment hours later on a Sunday and said this is fixed and he a Sunday and said this is fixed and he a Sunday and said this is fixed and he pulled his pulled his PR out. So this is pulled his pulled his PR out. So this is pulled his pulled his PR out. So this is one example. You can go look at all the one example. You can go look at all the one example. You can go look at all the response times and we didn't always win response times and we didn't always win response times and we didn't always win but um you know someone had a problem but um you know someone had a problem but um you know someone had a problem and we fixed it in hours on a Sunday. and we fixed it in hours on a Sunday. and we fixed it in hours on a Sunday. That's it's a great That's it's a great That's it's a great example. Um CPE example. Um CPE example. Um CPE uh little bit longer story. So uh we did uh little bit longer story. So uh we did uh little bit longer story. So uh we did volagement from April to December of 24. volagement from April to December of 24. volagement from April to December of 24. Um, I like to look back and call it a Um, I like to look back and call it a Um, I like to look back and call it a committed sincere committed sincere committed sincere experiment. Um, anybody can in this room experiment. Um, anybody can in this room experiment. Um, anybody can in this room can generate syntactically correct CPE. can generate syntactically correct CPE. can generate syntactically correct CPE. It's not all that tricky. You do have to It's not all that tricky. You do have to It's not all that tricky. You do have to wash the dash, the asterisk characters wash the dash, the asterisk characters wash the dash, the asterisk characters trip you up. Um, but what is that trip you up. Um, but what is that trip you up. Um, but what is that syntactically correct? Is it semant? syntactically correct? Is it semant? syntactically correct? Is it semant? Does it mean anything? Who's CPE? Whose Does it mean anything? Who's CPE? Whose Does it mean anything? Who's CPE? Whose name? Who owns the names? And by design, name? Who owns the names? And by design, name? Who owns the names? And by design, because of years ago, NVD owns a NVD because of years ago, NVD owns a NVD because of years ago, NVD owns a NVD dictionary of CPE. So if it's the right dictionary of CPE. So if it's the right dictionary of CPE. So if it's the right name or not, the question is what's your name or not, the question is what's your name or not, the question is what's your frame of reference? And if it's the NVD, frame of reference? And if it's the NVD, frame of reference? And if it's the NVD, it has to be in the dictionary, which it it has to be in the dictionary, which it it has to be in the dictionary, which it may or may not be. And that's a whole may or may not be. And that's a whole may or may not be. And that's a whole different problem than did I write the different problem than did I write the different problem than did I write the correct number of colons and the right correct number of colons and the right correct number of colons and the right capitalization and all those things. Um, capitalization and all those things. Um, capitalization and all those things. Um, so enrichment was, if necessary, was so enrichment was, if necessary, was so enrichment was, if necessary, was making up CPEs. We looked in the making up CPEs. We looked in the making up CPEs. We looked in the dictionary first. We looked in the NVD dictionary first. We looked in the NVD dictionary first. We looked in the NVD corpus for CPEs that were in CPE but not corpus for CPEs that were in CPE but not corpus for CPEs that were in CPE but not in the dictionary second. And last in the dictionary second. And last in the dictionary second. And last choice was make one up. Uh which means choice was make one up. Uh which means choice was make one up. Uh which means you have to maybe fix it later and it's you have to maybe fix it later and it's you have to maybe fix it later and it's a huge uh a huge mess. Um this a huge uh a huge mess. Um this a huge uh a huge mess. Um this distracted us from the core the core distracted us from the core the core distracted us from the core the core work we were trying to do. It took a lot work we were trying to do. It took a lot work we were trying to do. It took a lot of time and energy. I don't remember the of time and energy. I don't remember the of time and energy. I don't remember the exact math, but I think, you know, an exact math, but I think, you know, an exact math, but I think, you know, an average record time divided by people average record time divided by people average record time divided by people divided by minutes was like twothirds of divided by minutes was like twothirds of divided by minutes was like twothirds of it were on the CPE part because you had it were on the CPE part because you had it were on the CPE part because you had to go look up all this stuff, figure out to go look up all this stuff, figure out to go look up all this stuff, figure out the supplier, vendor, developer name. the supplier, vendor, developer name. the supplier, vendor, developer name. No, no, we don't do it that way anymore. No, no, we don't do it that way anymore. No, no, we don't do it that way anymore. We do it this way. You don't say GitHub, We do it this way. You don't say GitHub, We do it this way. You don't say GitHub, you say the person's name. Things change you say the person's name. Things change you say the person's name. Things change over time. Um, it's a over time. Um, it's a over time. Um, it's a mess. We did pay attention to who is mess. We did pay attention to who is mess. We did pay attention to who is using CPE downstream or not. My using CPE downstream or not. My using CPE downstream or not. My impression from the get-go was people impression from the get-go was people impression from the get-go was people use this. There's well structured use this. There's well structured use this. There's well structured information maybe of quality. Uh in the information maybe of quality. Uh in the information maybe of quality. Uh in the NVD version of it, you have the nice uh NVD version of it, you have the nice uh NVD version of it, you have the nice uh logic to have ranges and configurations logic to have ranges and configurations logic to have ranges and configurations and things. Um some feedback and some and things. Um some feedback and some and things. Um some feedback and some feedback that SISA conducted actually feedback that SISA conducted actually feedback that SISA conducted actually didn't really lead to a strong argument didn't really lead to a strong argument didn't really lead to a strong argument that people really really needed and that people really really needed and that people really really needed and wanted CPE. So I've really heard wanted CPE. So I've really heard wanted CPE. So I've really heard evidence of both arguments and I don't evidence of both arguments and I don't evidence of both arguments and I don't know which one is the is the winner know which one is the is the winner know which one is the is the winner overall. One more snafu here is at the overall. One more snafu here is at the overall. One more snafu here is at the time the CVE record format support for time the CVE record format support for time the CVE record format support for CPE was uh I don't know vestigial. It CPE was uh I don't know vestigial. It CPE was uh I don't know vestigial. It was just you could throw one in and it was just you could throw one in and it was just you could throw one in and it didn't didn't really help you with didn't didn't really help you with didn't didn't really help you with ranges and versions and stuff. That has ranges and versions and stuff. That has ranges and versions and stuff. That has since changed. The newer version of the since changed. The newer version of the since changed. The newer version of the of the schema and the record format does of the schema and the record format does of the schema and the record format does support uh CPE fully as if it came from support uh CPE fully as if it came from support uh CPE fully as if it came from uh the uh the uh the NVD. Um, and yes, you can get an NVD. Um, and yes, you can get an NVD. Um, and yes, you can get an argument about CPE also, and you'll also argument about CPE also, and you'll also argument about CPE also, and you'll also be probably wasting your time, but be probably wasting your time, but be probably wasting your time, but again, I feel better having written uh again, I feel better having written uh again, I feel better having written uh written something down, so it's on the written something down, so it's on the written something down, so it's on the record in GitHub somewhere. Um, but record in GitHub somewhere. Um, but record in GitHub somewhere. Um, but yeah, we try to try to find good sources yeah, we try to try to find good sources yeah, we try to try to find good sources first. Um, it was difficult and um, if first. Um, it was difficult and um, if first. Um, it was difficult and um, if anyone's not familiar with this problem anyone's not familiar with this problem anyone's not familiar with this problem at the bottom here, right, globally at the bottom here, right, globally at the bottom here, right, globally naming software is completely unsolved naming software is completely unsolved naming software is completely unsolved and it's holding us all back. Every talk and it's holding us all back. Every talk and it's holding us all back. Every talk this week is also probably dependent on this week is also probably dependent on this week is also probably dependent on not having solved global software not having solved global software not having solved global software identity. Okay, we're close. We're at identity. Okay, we're close. We're at identity. Okay, we're close. We're at five minutes. I saw the five-minute flag five minutes. I saw the five-minute flag five minutes. I saw the five-minute flag come up. Uh I'm going to uh ask the come up. Uh I'm going to uh ask the come up. Uh I'm going to uh ask the voice in the sky to back over here. voice in the sky to back over here. voice in the sky to back over here. All right, I will close it out. So to All right, I will close it out. So to All right, I will close it out. So to double tap something from the previous double tap something from the previous double tap something from the previous slide that Art said, I think it's really slide that Art said, I think it's really slide that Art said, I think it's really important. you know, we did make a important. you know, we did make a important. you know, we did make a decision after experimenting with for decision after experimenting with for decision after experimenting with for several months with CPE to really focus several months with CPE to really focus several months with CPE to really focus on our core competencies of technical on our core competencies of technical on our core competencies of technical vulnerability analysis um like in the vulnerability analysis um like in the vulnerability analysis um like in the context of that response and context of that response and context of that response and prioritization work and also to refocus prioritization work and also to refocus prioritization work and also to refocus on good coverage of emerging CVEes um so on good coverage of emerging CVEes um so on good coverage of emerging CVEes um so to kind of transition smoothly which I to kind of transition smoothly which I to kind of transition smoothly which I didn't do that was a little clunky sorry didn't do that was a little clunky sorry didn't do that was a little clunky sorry Art um to transition into this kind of Art um to transition into this kind of Art um to transition into this kind of next slide uh yes that is also Jack next slide uh yes that is also Jack next slide uh yes that is also Jack Black, but at this point he has Black, but at this point he has Black, but at this point he has discovered bow ties and fire, so we're discovered bow ties and fire, so we're discovered bow ties and fire, so we're doing a little better. Um, we learned a doing a little better. Um, we learned a doing a little better. Um, we learned a lot over that first year. That CPE, um, lot over that first year. That CPE, um, lot over that first year. That CPE, um, experimentation for us taught experimentation for us taught experimentation for us taught us several different sort of tactical us several different sort of tactical us several different sort of tactical things, but it also kind of reminded us things, but it also kind of reminded us things, but it also kind of reminded us that there will be unsolved problems that there will be unsolved problems that there will be unsolved problems with the vulnerability ecosystem that we with the vulnerability ecosystem that we with the vulnerability ecosystem that we may experiment with in vulnerrichment may experiment with in vulnerrichment may experiment with in vulnerrichment and not solve through vault enrichment. and not solve through vault enrichment. and not solve through vault enrichment. Um but I think that's okay. That Um but I think that's okay. That Um but I think that's okay. That hands-on experience manipulating data hands-on experience manipulating data hands-on experience manipulating data has taught us a lot of lessons has taught us a lot of lessons has taught us a lot of lessons operationally that we can then sort of operationally that we can then sort of operationally that we can then sort of feed into any um recommendations for feed into any um recommendations for feed into any um recommendations for determining approach to solving the determining approach to solving the determining approach to solving the problem. So I think I think that was problem. So I think I think that was problem. So I think I think that was actually a very valuable lesson that we actually a very valuable lesson that we actually a very valuable lesson that we learned and time well spent. Um, learned and time well spent. Um, learned and time well spent. Um, something else that I think that we can something else that I think that we can something else that I think that we can probably mostly agree on here is that uh probably mostly agree on here is that uh probably mostly agree on here is that uh nonauthoritative enrichment, in other nonauthoritative enrichment, in other nonauthoritative enrichment, in other words, enrichment that's conducted by a words, enrichment that's conducted by a words, enrichment that's conducted by a third party that's not the CNA or the third party that's not the CNA or the third party that's not the CNA or the vendor or some kind of like research vendor or some kind of like research vendor or some kind of like research expert, you know, assisting the vendor expert, you know, assisting the vendor expert, you know, assisting the vendor pushes the cost of enrichment up and the pushes the cost of enrichment up and the pushes the cost of enrichment up and the quality down. We continue as SISA and as quality down. We continue as SISA and as quality down. We continue as SISA and as a CVE program to push for that a CVE program to push for that a CVE program to push for that originating CNA or the manufacturer or originating CNA or the manufacturer or originating CNA or the manufacturer or the maintainer to provide that the maintainer to provide that the maintainer to provide that enrichment data, the CVSS and the CVE um enrichment data, the CVSS and the CVE um enrichment data, the CVSS and the CVE um at birth, so to speak, of the CVE at birth, so to speak, of the CVE at birth, so to speak, of the CVE record. And um last but not least, I'm record. And um last but not least, I'm record. And um last but not least, I'm going to reach back into my sort of going to reach back into my sort of going to reach back into my sort of former life as a high school teacher and former life as a high school teacher and former life as a high school teacher and tell you that it's a lot easier to tell you that it's a lot easier to tell you that it's a lot easier to defend your answer when you show your defend your answer when you show your defend your answer when you show your work. Um, we talked about this a little work. Um, we talked about this a little work. Um, we talked about this a little bit, but volrichment in lots of case in bit, but volrichment in lots of case in bit, but volrichment in lots of case in in lots of cases proved to be a good in lots of cases proved to be a good in lots of cases proved to be a good experiment ground. It's a good place for experiment ground. It's a good place for experiment ground. It's a good place for us to test something um in an us to test something um in an us to test something um in an environment where we could really do it environment where we could really do it environment where we could really do it at scale and see if it works. And when at scale and see if it works. And when at scale and see if it works. And when it doesn't, we can go back to our it doesn't, we can go back to our it doesn't, we can go back to our community and say, "Hey, we tried it and community and say, "Hey, we tried it and community and say, "Hey, we tried it and it didn't work." So, we don't recommend it didn't work." So, we don't recommend it didn't work." So, we don't recommend doing that or hey, we don't recommend doing that or hey, we don't recommend doing that or hey, we don't recommend that our organization do that. A great that our organization do that. A great that our organization do that. A great example of this is we have pretty good example of this is we have pretty good example of this is we have pretty good data that shows us that some of the, you data that shows us that some of the, you data that shows us that some of the, you know, highest, for example, CBSS scored know, highest, for example, CBSS scored know, highest, for example, CBSS scored vulnerabilities never ended up in our vulnerabilities never ended up in our vulnerabilities never ended up in our Kev. You know, this is just an easier Kev. You know, this is just an easier Kev. You know, this is just an easier way for us to sort of do that way for us to sort of do that way for us to sort of do that calculation. Next slide, please. All calculation. Next slide, please. All calculation. Next slide, please. All right. Going into the future, I'll wrap right. Going into the future, I'll wrap right. Going into the future, I'll wrap it up in 30 seconds so that we have two it up in 30 seconds so that we have two it up in 30 seconds so that we have two minutes of questions. We want to see minutes of questions. We want to see minutes of questions. We want to see continued community engagement. Um if continued community engagement. Um if continued community engagement. Um if you have questions about ven enrichment you have questions about ven enrichment you have questions about ven enrichment or comments about specifically or comments about specifically or comments about specifically vulenriched CVEes please feel free to um vulenriched CVEes please feel free to um vulenriched CVEes please feel free to um to do that in our public repository to do that in our public repository to do that in our public repository which is on GitHub. Um again which is on GitHub. Um again which is on GitHub. Um again doubletapping the fact that C S CISA doubletapping the fact that C S CISA doubletapping the fact that C S CISA VM's mission has always existed but now VM's mission has always existed but now VM's mission has always existed but now we would like to provide as much of that we would like to provide as much of that we would like to provide as much of that information as a public service um that information as a public service um that information as a public service um that we can and that's kind of the ethos of we can and that's kind of the ethos of we can and that's kind of the ethos of vulnerability management at SISA. And vulnerability management at SISA. And vulnerability management at SISA. And then finally that experimentation then finally that experimentation then finally that experimentation mindset um that's not going away. The mindset um that's not going away. The mindset um that's not going away. The team behind vulnerrichment believes very team behind vulnerrichment believes very team behind vulnerrichment believes very strongly in both the core tenants of strongly in both the core tenants of strongly in both the core tenants of transparency and also continuing to transparency and also continuing to transparency and also continuing to evolve and try new things. So what could evolve and try new things. So what could evolve and try new things. So what could be next? I don't know. Maybe we try a be next? I don't know. Maybe we try a be next? I don't know. Maybe we try a new software identifier, maybe we try new software identifier, maybe we try new software identifier, maybe we try references or something like that. But references or something like that. But references or something like that. But we will continue to experiment with full we will continue to experiment with full we will continue to experiment with full enrichment and hopefully have good data enrichment and hopefully have good data enrichment and hopefully have good data to back up um our decisions about how to to back up um our decisions about how to to back up um our decisions about how to move forward. So that's all I have. Art. move forward. So that's all I have. Art. move forward. So that's all I have. Art. Awesome. Last slide. I can no longer see Awesome. Last slide. I can no longer see Awesome. Last slide. I can no longer see the room. I just see the a black box, the room. I just see the a black box, the room. I just see the a black box, but if there are questions, hopefully but if there are questions, hopefully but if there are questions, hopefully Art can answer or ask them out loud. Art can answer or ask them out loud. Art can answer or ask them out loud. Interrupt in the room, it looks like. Interrupt in the room, it looks like. Interrupt in the room, it looks like. Okay. Okay. Okay. Yeah, we have just a couple of minutes. Yeah, we have just a couple of minutes. Yeah, we have just a couple of minutes. So, so let me just start this by saying So, so let me just start this by saying So, so let me just start this by saying there's nothing in here after this. And there's nothing in here after this. And there's nothing in here after this. And if you want to go go, but we're going to if you want to go go, but we're going to if you want to go go, but we're going to As long as Lindsay and and Art are As long as Lindsay and and Art are As long as Lindsay and and Art are good. Okay, we'll we'll take questions. good. Okay, we'll we'll take questions. good. Okay, we'll we'll take questions. There's definitely some questions in There's definitely some questions in There's definitely some questions in Discord, right? Or were they all Discord, right? Or were they all Discord, right? Or were they all answered? answered? answered? question in Discord, but since I have a question in Discord, but since I have a question in Discord, but since I have a the mic, I'm gonna ask my own question the mic, I'm gonna ask my own question the mic, I'm gonna ask my own question first. Um, sorry guys on Discord. Um, so first. Um, sorry guys on Discord. Um, so first. Um, sorry guys on Discord. Um, so I saw the change that you all have made I saw the change that you all have made I saw the change that you all have made with CPE. Um, now that you've kind of with CPE. Um, now that you've kind of with CPE. Um, now that you've kind of seen firsthand the challenges with CPE, seen firsthand the challenges with CPE, seen firsthand the challenges with CPE, do you think SIZA may revisit including do you think SIZA may revisit including do you think SIZA may revisit including that as part of the secure by design that as part of the secure by design that as part of the secure by design pledge? That's a great question. I think we're That's a great question. I think we're That's a great question. I think we're always sort of reconsidering what should always sort of reconsidering what should always sort of reconsidering what should and shouldn't be in the pledge. Um, and shouldn't be in the pledge. Um, and shouldn't be in the pledge. Um, yeah, great question. Uh jumping over to what was in the Uh jumping over to what was in the Uh jumping over to what was in the discord. Um when NVD and SIZA both discord. Um when NVD and SIZA both discord. Um when NVD and SIZA both provide vulnerrichment but have pretty provide vulnerrichment but have pretty provide vulnerrichment but have pretty different assessments of a different assessments of a different assessments of a vulnerability, is there any mechanism to vulnerability, is there any mechanism to vulnerability, is there any mechanism to synchronize with each other? What is the synchronize with each other? What is the synchronize with each other? What is the relationship between SIZA and NVD relationship between SIZA and NVD relationship between SIZA and NVD volrichment teams? Would you like me to I can take that. Would you like me to I can take that. Would you like me to I can take that. I'm sorry I can't see you, Art, so I I'm sorry I can't see you, Art, so I I'm sorry I can't see you, Art, so I don't know if you're like reaching for don't know if you're like reaching for don't know if you're like reaching for the mic or not. Uh I can say do you the mic or not. Uh I can say do you the mic or not. Uh I can say do you sorry I heard you I heard your voice. sorry I heard you I heard your voice. sorry I heard you I heard your voice. You go over. Okay. Thanks. Um yeah we You go over. Okay. Thanks. Um yeah we You go over. Okay. Thanks. Um yeah we have a good relationship with the NVT have a good relationship with the NVT have a good relationship with the NVT NVD team at NIST. I suspect if we had um NVD team at NIST. I suspect if we had um NVD team at NIST. I suspect if we had um serious disagreements on or serious disagreements on or serious disagreements on or disagreements in the data with the NVD disagreements in the data with the NVD disagreements in the data with the NVD team, we could get on a call and and team, we could get on a call and and team, we could get on a call and and have a conversation to understand their have a conversation to understand their have a conversation to understand their perspective. Um, I don't know that that perspective. Um, I don't know that that perspective. Um, I don't know that that has necessarily happened yet. Art, you has necessarily happened yet. Art, you has necessarily happened yet. Art, you could probably tell me that, but um, we could probably tell me that, but um, we could probably tell me that, but um, we continue to have a close working continue to have a close working continue to have a close working relationship with the NIST NVD team and relationship with the NIST NVD team and relationship with the NIST NVD team and meet with them regularly to to try to meet with them regularly to to try to meet with them regularly to to try to sort of just see what see what's on the sort of just see what see what's on the sort of just see what see what's on the horizon and and work together, continue horizon and and work together, continue horizon and and work together, continue working together across government. working together across government. working together across government. Yeah, there's no I can just on a Yeah, there's no I can just on a Yeah, there's no I can just on a slightly more tactical level, there's no slightly more tactical level, there's no slightly more tactical level, there's no official official like data related official official like data related official official like data related relationship. Um, we have we do some relationship. Um, we have we do some relationship. Um, we have we do some analysis and scripts and check for for analysis and scripts and check for for analysis and scripts and check for for things that are off and and try to things that are off and and try to things that are off and and try to resolve those, but it's not nothing resolve those, but it's not nothing resolve those, but it's not nothing automated at this point or a direct automated at this point or a direct automated at this point or a direct relationship that one, you know, relationship that one, you know, relationship that one, you know, overrides the other. Yep. Not a question, Art and other. Yep. Not a question, Art and other. Yep. Not a question, Art and Lindsay, but I just wanted to commend Lindsay, but I just wanted to commend Lindsay, but I just wanted to commend you on your responsiveness um for my you on your responsiveness um for my you on your responsiveness um for my feedback on C.WE.S. I was very feedback on C.WE.S. I was very feedback on C.WE.S. I was very pleasantly surprised when I was playing pleasantly surprised when I was playing pleasantly surprised when I was playing with LM and CWs, and you guys responded with LM and CWs, and you guys responded with LM and CWs, and you guys responded within 24 hours. I thought fantastic, within 24 hours. I thought fantastic, within 24 hours.
