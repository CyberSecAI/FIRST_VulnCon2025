Kind: captions Language: en Um, thank you for the introduction. I'm Um, thank you for the introduction. I'm Um, thank you for the introduction. I'm Benjamin Edwards. I'm a principal Benjamin Edwards. I'm a principal Benjamin Edwards. I'm a principal research scientist at Bitsite. I'm here research scientist at Bitsite. I'm here research scientist at Bitsite. I'm here with my colleague Sandra Vinberg uh as a with my colleague Sandra Vinberg uh as a with my colleague Sandra Vinberg uh as a manager in our product research uh manager in our product research uh manager in our product research uh organization. And today we're going to organization. And today we're going to organization. And today we're going to talk to you about vulnerability risk. talk to you about vulnerability risk. talk to you about vulnerability risk. Um, and in particular, we're going to Um, and in particular, we're going to Um, and in particular, we're going to talk about uh kind of expanding our idea talk about uh kind of expanding our idea talk about uh kind of expanding our idea of what vulnerability risk is. So, you of what vulnerability risk is. So, you of what vulnerability risk is. So, you may recognize the quote. Um, this is of may recognize the quote. Um, this is of may recognize the quote. Um, this is of course a play on the FDR quote. we have course a play on the FDR quote. we have course a play on the FDR quote. we have nothing to fear but fear itself. And in nothing to fear but fear itself. And in nothing to fear but fear itself. And in the same way, we want to expand the idea the same way, we want to expand the idea the same way, we want to expand the idea of risk in a way that says um to to give of risk in a way that says um to to give of risk in a way that says um to to give us a new vision forward for risk, a new us a new vision forward for risk, a new us a new vision forward for risk, a new progressive vision forward for risk. And progressive vision forward for risk. And progressive vision forward for risk. And the only thing that we have to risk is the only thing that we have to risk is the only thing that we have to risk is our preconceived notions, right? That's our preconceived notions, right? That's our preconceived notions, right? That's the only thing we're going to lose. Uh the only thing we're going to lose. Uh the only thing we're going to lose. Uh so let's talk about this. Um here is a so let's talk about this. Um here is a so let's talk about this. Um here is a question that I'm going to kick off with question that I'm going to kick off with question that I'm going to kick off with and I'm going to see some eyes roll or and I'm going to see some eyes roll or and I'm going to see some eyes roll or some chuckles. Uh but the idea is like some chuckles. Uh but the idea is like some chuckles. Uh but the idea is like what exactly is risk? Um, and since what exactly is risk? Um, and since what exactly is risk? Um, and since we're at Volcon, we're going to actually we're at Volcon, we're going to actually we're at Volcon, we're going to actually talk about what is vulnerability risk, talk about what is vulnerability risk, talk about what is vulnerability risk, right? So, let's specify a little bit. right? So, let's specify a little bit. right? So, let's specify a little bit. Um, if you'll forgive my crudess, um, Um, if you'll forgive my crudess, um, Um, if you'll forgive my crudess, um, here is a meme, which is of course how here is a meme, which is of course how here is a meme, which is of course how we all communicate these days with the we all communicate these days with the we all communicate these days with the internet. And this represents my journey internet. And this represents my journey internet. And this represents my journey on a as a risk vulnerability risk on a as a risk vulnerability risk on a as a risk vulnerability risk person. Um, we start out and I was like, person. Um, we start out and I was like, person. Um, we start out and I was like, you know what, risk is just loss times you know what, risk is just loss times you know what, risk is just loss times probability. That's all we need. Um, and probability. That's all we need. Um, and probability. That's all we need. Um, and then as I learned more about the field, then as I learned more about the field, then as I learned more about the field, I got to the point of like, no, we have I got to the point of like, no, we have I got to the point of like, no, we have all these frameworks. We have to all these frameworks. We have to all these frameworks. We have to organize the information correctly. We organize the information correctly. We organize the information correctly. We have to get these measurements correct. have to get these measurements correct. have to get these measurements correct. We have to be very precise about it. And We have to be very precise about it. And We have to be very precise about it. And as I've matured uh I've learned that as I've matured uh I've learned that as I've matured uh I've learned that like everything is uh relative and that like everything is uh relative and that like everything is uh relative and that we it is really poss probability of risk we it is really poss probability of risk we it is really poss probability of risk or possibility of risk. Uh but that is or possibility of risk. Uh but that is or possibility of risk. Uh but that is complicated but that's what it boils complicated but that's what it boils complicated but that's what it boils down to and so that's what we should down to and so that's what we should down to and so that's what we should measure in the end. Uh and of course measure in the end. Uh and of course measure in the end. Uh and of course I've won this argument by drawing the I've won this argument by drawing the I've won this argument by drawing the picture this way. That's how these work. picture this way. That's how these work. picture this way. That's how these work. Um so let's let's give a definition of Um so let's let's give a definition of Um so let's let's give a definition of vulnerability risk. It is the vulnerability risk. It is the vulnerability risk. It is the possibility of a loss due to the possibility of a loss due to the possibility of a loss due to the presence of a vulnerability on an asset presence of a vulnerability on an asset presence of a vulnerability on an asset that someone cares about. So, I'm using that someone cares about. So, I'm using that someone cares about. So, I'm using the word asset here deliberately. It's the word asset here deliberately. It's the word asset here deliberately. It's anything uh like a device, a web page, a anything uh like a device, a web page, a anything uh like a device, a web page, a service, anything that is is possibly in service, anything that is is possibly in service, anything that is is possibly in the digital world that can have a the digital world that can have a the digital world that can have a software vulnerability on it and that software vulnerability on it and that software vulnerability on it and that someone cares about. Uh this could be someone cares about. Uh this could be someone cares about. Uh this could be monetary loss, this could be service monetary loss, this could be service monetary loss, this could be service disruption, uh but some kind of loss. disruption, uh but some kind of loss. disruption, uh but some kind of loss. We're going to define these very We're going to define these very We're going to define these very generically. generically. generically. Um, I'm going to make one last edit here Um, I'm going to make one last edit here Um, I'm going to make one last edit here and I'm going to talk about instead of and I'm going to talk about instead of and I'm going to talk about instead of possibility, we're going to talk about possibility, we're going to talk about possibility, we're going to talk about probability of loss because I am of probability of loss because I am of probability of loss because I am of course a data scientist and I live in course a data scientist and I live in course a data scientist and I live in models and I want to be a slightly more models and I want to be a slightly more models and I want to be a slightly more precise in that definition and we're precise in that definition and we're precise in that definition and we're going to talk about probability of going to talk about probability of going to talk about probability of loss. So, uh the we've done all this loss. So, uh the we've done all this loss. So, uh the we've done all this introduction to say how can we measure introduction to say how can we measure introduction to say how can we measure it and this is what we really want to it and this is what we really want to it and this is what we really want to talk about today is all the ways that we talk about today is all the ways that we talk about today is all the ways that we can measure vulnerability risk uh using can measure vulnerability risk uh using can measure vulnerability risk uh using this definition. Uh so with that, I'm this definition. Uh so with that, I'm this definition. Uh so with that, I'm going to hand it off to Sander who's going to hand it off to Sander who's going to hand it off to Sander who's going to talk about how we think we going to talk about how we think we going to talk about how we think we measure those things. All right. So, uh Ben has kind of got us All right. So, uh Ben has kind of got us All right. So, uh Ben has kind of got us started here and and now what we're started here and and now what we're started here and and now what we're trying to do, right, is we're trying to trying to do, right, is we're trying to trying to do, right, is we're trying to move from these abstract concepts down move from these abstract concepts down move from these abstract concepts down into something that we can actually into something that we can actually into something that we can actually measure, right? So, let's decompose measure, right? So, let's decompose measure, right? So, let's decompose probability and loss a little bit. I probability and loss a little bit. I probability and loss a little bit. I realize it's a little elementary. realize it's a little elementary. realize it's a little elementary. Forgive me. We're we're getting Forgive me. We're we're getting Forgive me. We're we're getting somewhere, right? But so, we're talking somewhere, right? But so, we're talking somewhere, right? But so, we're talking about probability here. We're talking about probability here. We're talking about probability here. We're talking about the probability that a about the probability that a about the probability that a vulnerability is exploited by an vulnerability is exploited by an vulnerability is exploited by an attacker at an organization, right? attacker at an organization, right? attacker at an organization, right? Pretty basic. But there's a bunch of Pretty basic. But there's a bunch of Pretty basic. But there's a bunch of things, preconditions and and kind of things, preconditions and and kind of things, preconditions and and kind of contextual issues that go into this, contextual issues that go into this, contextual issues that go into this, right? So, we need an attacker to right? So, we need an attacker to right? So, we need an attacker to actually target that organization. We actually target that organization. We actually target that organization. We also need an attacker to be able to find also need an attacker to be able to find also need an attacker to be able to find a vulnerable asset with that CVE on it. a vulnerable asset with that CVE on it. a vulnerable asset with that CVE on it. Right? I want to briefly note that this Right? I want to briefly note that this Right? I want to briefly note that this can happen in either order. You can have can happen in either order. You can have can happen in either order. You can have an attacker decide to use a CVE and then an attacker decide to use a CVE and then an attacker decide to use a CVE and then they pick their target or they can pick they pick their target or they can pick they pick their target or they can pick their target and then they look at the their target and then they look at the their target and then they look at the CVS available to them on that target and CVS available to them on that target and CVS available to them on that target and then they go go after it. Either way, then they go go after it. Either way, then they go go after it. Either way, doesn't matter. Uh it is of course a doesn't matter. Uh it is of course a doesn't matter. Uh it is of course a precondition that the the vulnerability precondition that the the vulnerability precondition that the the vulnerability has to be open and and unrediated by the has to be open and and unrediated by the has to be open and and unrediated by the organization. There needs to be the organization. There needs to be the organization. There needs to be the existence of exploit code that the existence of exploit code that the existence of exploit code that the attacker has sufficient sophistication attacker has sufficient sophistication attacker has sufficient sophistication to actually run and the exploit code to actually run and the exploit code to actually run and the exploit code itself needs to be good enough and again itself needs to be good enough and again itself needs to be good enough and again the the attacker needs to have the the attacker needs to have the the attacker needs to have sufficient sophistication to do sufficient sophistication to do sufficient sophistication to do something with that successful exploit. something with that successful exploit. something with that successful exploit. uh because not a lot of exploits sort of uh because not a lot of exploits sort of uh because not a lot of exploits sort of produce what an attacker is trying to produce what an attacker is trying to produce what an attacker is trying to get just off a oneliner. So that's the get just off a oneliner. So that's the get just off a oneliner. So that's the probability side. Talking about the loss probability side. Talking about the loss probability side. Talking about the loss side, we have the losses that are side, we have the losses that are side, we have the losses that are immediately associated with the event immediately associated with the event immediately associated with the event itself. So we have the sort of the itself. So we have the sort of the itself. So we have the sort of the business value that is lost due to the business value that is lost due to the business value that is lost due to the downtime of that asset. We have any downtime of that asset. We have any downtime of that asset. We have any liability that we might incur as a liability that we might incur as a liability that we might incur as a result of the loss of the data on that result of the loss of the data on that result of the loss of the data on that asset. Um I think it's it's kind of asset. Um I think it's it's kind of asset. Um I think it's it's kind of obvious but important to say that for obvious but important to say that for obvious but important to say that for the most part the computers that we're the most part the computers that we're the most part the computers that we're talking about are valuable to the extent talking about are valuable to the extent talking about are valuable to the extent that they're connected to other that they're connected to other that they're connected to other computers, right? So there's also the computers, right? So there's also the computers, right? So there's also the losses associated with escalation losses associated with escalation losses associated with escalation privilege lateral movement onto privilege lateral movement onto privilege lateral movement onto different systems which sort of turns an different systems which sort of turns an different systems which sort of turns an exploitation into a whole different kind exploitation into a whole different kind exploitation into a whole different kind of event right there also the losses of event right there also the losses of event right there also the losses that show up after the fact. So we have that show up after the fact. So we have that show up after the fact. So we have the cost of investigation investigation the cost of investigation investigation the cost of investigation investigation the cost of recovery and the always the cost of recovery and the always the cost of recovery and the always difficult to quantify sort of difficult to quantify sort of difficult to quantify sort of reputational loss right. So there are reputational loss right. So there are reputational loss right. So there are frameworks that allow us to go from frameworks that allow us to go from frameworks that allow us to go from these abstract concepts to some more these abstract concepts to some more these abstract concepts to some more concrete measurements. Maybe the the the concrete measurements. Maybe the the the concrete measurements. Maybe the the the most robust arguably is is fair. Um and most robust arguably is is fair. Um and most robust arguably is is fair. Um and and fair has sort of come up with this and fair has sort of come up with this and fair has sort of come up with this hierarchy that helps us sort of plug hierarchy that helps us sort of plug hierarchy that helps us sort of plug different kinds of observations in and different kinds of observations in and different kinds of observations in and then boil that down into some sort of then boil that down into some sort of then boil that down into some sort of score so we can comp compare this score so we can comp compare this score so we can comp compare this vulnerability against the next vulnerability against the next vulnerability against the next vulnerability, right? Uh and and we vulnerability, right? Uh and and we vulnerability, right? Uh and and we should note that there are a lot of should note that there are a lot of should note that there are a lot of measurements or observations that are measurements or observations that are measurements or observations that are already kind of out there in the wild already kind of out there in the wild already kind of out there in the wild that most of us already understand that that most of us already understand that that most of us already understand that we can sort of plug in to fair in order we can sort of plug in to fair in order we can sort of plug in to fair in order to generate our scores. There are other to generate our scores. There are other to generate our scores. There are other frameworks as well, right? So there is frameworks as well, right? So there is frameworks as well, right? So there is octave um there is the the NIST CSF octave um there is the the NIST CSF octave um there is the the NIST CSF cyber security framework there uh the cyber security framework there uh the cyber security framework there uh the the MITER threat assessment and the MITER threat assessment and the MITER threat assessment and remediation analysis Tara there is ISO remediation analysis Tara there is ISO remediation analysis Tara there is ISO 31K with 27K1 31K with 27K1 31K with 27K1 um these are all frameworks that will um these are all frameworks that will um these are all frameworks that will help you if you have information figure help you if you have information figure help you if you have information figure out which vulnerability presents the out which vulnerability presents the out which vulnerability presents the greatest risk right but the thing is greatest risk right but the thing is greatest risk right but the thing is that they all require you to bring your that they all require you to bring your that they all require you to bring your own measurements right these are own measurements right these are own measurements right these are essentially organizational frameworks essentially organizational frameworks essentially organizational frameworks decision-m guidance frameworks and they decision-m guidance frameworks and they decision-m guidance frameworks and they need us to tell them what we know on a need us to tell them what we know on a need us to tell them what we know on a ground truth level about vaults. Right? ground truth level about vaults. Right? ground truth level about vaults. Right? So, at this point, I kind of want to So, at this point, I kind of want to So, at this point, I kind of want to pause on the risk concept and I want to pause on the risk concept and I want to pause on the risk concept and I want to show you guys a quote. This is actually show you guys a quote. This is actually show you guys a quote. This is actually a quote that uh that popped up. This was a quote that uh that popped up. This was a quote that uh that popped up. This was a discussion between me and some of my a discussion between me and some of my a discussion between me and some of my mentors and this is this came from a guy mentors and this is this came from a guy mentors and this is this came from a guy who literally is the reason I'm in this who literally is the reason I'm in this who literally is the reason I'm in this field. It's the reason I'm in front of field. It's the reason I'm in front of field. It's the reason I'm in front of you guys. He said this a couple months you guys. He said this a couple months you guys. He said this a couple months ago and he said, "There's so much noise ago and he said, "There's so much noise ago and he said, "There's so much noise around CUSS versus EPSS versus some around CUSS versus EPSS versus some around CUSS versus EPSS versus some random formula." So risk score goes up, random formula." So risk score goes up, random formula." So risk score goes up, risk score goes down on a particular risk score goes down on a particular risk score goes down on a particular vulnerability. These are how many angels vulnerability. These are how many angels vulnerability. These are how many angels can dance on the head of a pin style can dance on the head of a pin style can dance on the head of a pin style debates. Vulnerabilities are only debates. Vulnerabilities are only debates. Vulnerabilities are only meaningful in context and low, medium, meaningful in context and low, medium, meaningful in context and low, medium, high, who cares? I've seen pentesters high, who cares? I've seen pentesters high, who cares? I've seen pentesters and attacks stitch a bunch of low and attacks stitch a bunch of low and attacks stitch a bunch of low vulnerabilities together and pop a box. vulnerabilities together and pop a box. vulnerabilities together and pop a box. So that's what my mentor said and uh it So that's what my mentor said and uh it So that's what my mentor said and uh it it obviously stuck in my mind because I it obviously stuck in my mind because I it obviously stuck in my mind because I saved that and I thought I'm going to saved that and I thought I'm going to saved that and I thought I'm going to use that someday. So uh first thing I use that someday. So uh first thing I use that someday. So uh first thing I should say is I do not agree with should say is I do not agree with should say is I do not agree with everything in this statement. Uh the everything in this statement. Uh the everything in this statement. Uh the first thing is I think it's a little first thing is I think it's a little first thing is I think it's a little dangerous to take an anecdotal dangerous to take an anecdotal dangerous to take an anecdotal observation of a couple attacks or a observation of a couple attacks or a observation of a couple attacks or a penetration test and say I think that penetration test and say I think that penetration test and say I think that this is a framework for assessing risk. this is a framework for assessing risk. this is a framework for assessing risk. Right? But I think the most important Right? But I think the most important Right? But I think the most important thing here is this emphasis on context. thing here is this emphasis on context. thing here is this emphasis on context. And I think that this kind of speaks to And I think that this kind of speaks to And I think that this kind of speaks to a growing divide within our community a growing divide within our community a growing divide within our community between people who think that it's between people who think that it's between people who think that it's fruitful to collect large-scale data and fruitful to collect large-scale data and fruitful to collect large-scale data and model vulnerabilities based on that model vulnerabilities based on that model vulnerabilities based on that large-scale data and people who believe large-scale data and people who believe large-scale data and people who believe that vulnerability management really that vulnerability management really that vulnerability management really depends on veteran experts that are depends on veteran experts that are depends on veteran experts that are looking at every single instance of a looking at every single instance of a looking at every single instance of a vulnerability on an asset and kind of vulnerability on an asset and kind of vulnerability on an asset and kind of providing that context on almost like an providing that context on almost like an providing that context on almost like an ethnographic level. Right? So I want to ethnographic level. Right? So I want to ethnographic level. Right? So I want to kind of position these two poles in kind of position these two poles in kind of position these two poles in terms of how we think about terms of how we think about terms of how we think about vulnerability risk because the thesis, vulnerability risk because the thesis, vulnerability risk because the thesis, our entire claim, the reason we're here our entire claim, the reason we're here our entire claim, the reason we're here is that we believe that we can actually is that we believe that we can actually is that we believe that we can actually bridge this gap and we can achieve the bridge this gap and we can achieve the bridge this gap and we can achieve the context necessary for better risk context necessary for better risk context necessary for better risk management at scale through the management at scale through the management at scale through the expansion and the refinement of expansion and the refinement of expansion and the refinement of measurements about vulnerabilities. measurements about vulnerabilities. measurements about vulnerabilities. That's why we're here. So uh with that That's why we're here. So uh with that That's why we're here. So uh with that 16 slide introduction, this is what 16 slide introduction, this is what 16 slide introduction, this is what we're going to talk about today. We are we're going to talk about today. We are we're going to talk about today. We are going to briefly come over uh go over a going to briefly come over uh go over a going to briefly come over uh go over a few current methods for assessing few current methods for assessing few current methods for assessing vulnerability risk and then we're going vulnerability risk and then we're going vulnerability risk and then we're going to talk about these new measurements to talk about these new measurements to talk about these new measurements that we think have some value. We're that we think have some value. We're that we think have some value. We're going to talk about measurements local going to talk about measurements local going to talk about measurements local measurements meaning measurements about measurements meaning measurements about measurements meaning measurements about vulnerabilities within an organization. vulnerabilities within an organization. vulnerabilities within an organization. We're also going to talk about We're also going to talk about We're also going to talk about measurements in the entire global CV measurements in the entire global CV measurements in the entire global CV footprint and try to assess what can we footprint and try to assess what can we footprint and try to assess what can we learn about an individual organization's learn about an individual organization's learn about an individual organization's risk based on measuring the entire risk based on measuring the entire risk based on measuring the entire system. and then we'll try to pull this system. and then we'll try to pull this system. and then we'll try to pull this together and give you guys some useful together and give you guys some useful together and give you guys some useful advice so it's not just a couple of advice so it's not just a couple of advice so it's not just a couple of nerds on stage showing you guys a bunch nerds on stage showing you guys a bunch nerds on stage showing you guys a bunch of plots. Um, so uh, oh yeah, Ben's of plots. Um, so uh, oh yeah, Ben's of plots. Um, so uh, oh yeah, Ben's going to talk a little bit about some of going to talk a little bit about some of going to talk a little bit about some of the current meth methods for assessing the current meth methods for assessing the current meth methods for assessing vulnerability risk before we get into vulnerability risk before we get into vulnerability risk before we get into the the the measurements. Thank you. So, uh, when measurements. Thank you. So, uh, when measurements. Thank you. So, uh, when we're talking about vulnerability risk, we're talking about vulnerability risk, we're talking about vulnerability risk, I think it's worthwhile to start at the I think it's worthwhile to start at the I think it's worthwhile to start at the beginning. Um, and I'm going to say beginning. Um, and I'm going to say beginning. Um, and I'm going to say something slightly controversial in this something slightly controversial in this something slightly controversial in this next slide. um and that is CVSS is good next slide. um and that is CVSS is good next slide. um and that is CVSS is good actually. Um I think it's become actually. Um I think it's become actually. Um I think it's become somewhat popular among the vulnerability somewhat popular among the vulnerability somewhat popular among the vulnerability community to say this is an antiquated community to say this is an antiquated community to say this is an antiquated measure. Uh it's often wrong um and and measure. Uh it's often wrong um and and measure. Uh it's often wrong um and and it doesn't give us a good idea of how it doesn't give us a good idea of how it doesn't give us a good idea of how bad a vulnerability is. So of course bad a vulnerability is. So of course bad a vulnerability is. So of course CVSS is a measure of what they call CVSS is a measure of what they call CVSS is a measure of what they call technical severity. And in fact the CVSS technical severity. And in fact the CVSS technical severity. And in fact the CVSS uh SIG has said repeatedly this is not a uh SIG has said repeatedly this is not a uh SIG has said repeatedly this is not a measure of risk. I'm going to disagree measure of risk. I'm going to disagree measure of risk. I'm going to disagree here in a second. uh but rather it is here in a second. uh but rather it is here in a second. uh but rather it is like a a measure of like how how worried like a a measure of like how how worried like a a measure of like how how worried we should be about a vone how we should be about a vone how we should be about a vone how technically hard it is to exploit technically hard it is to exploit technically hard it is to exploit um I think it's good because it requires um I think it's good because it requires um I think it's good because it requires very little information to actually very little information to actually very little information to actually score something with this framework score something with this framework score something with this framework right uh so before publication time with right uh so before publication time with right uh so before publication time with a little information about a description a little information about a description a little information about a description you can usually uh get out the the base you can usually uh get out the the base you can usually uh get out the the base vector and get these measures and I will vector and get these measures and I will vector and get these measures and I will argue that these are the measures in argue that these are the measures in argue that these are the measures in CVSSV3 I'm sure everybody's familiar CVSSV3 I'm sure everybody's familiar CVSSV3 I'm sure everybody's familiar with um that a lot of these are with um that a lot of these are with um that a lot of these are incredibly useful incredibly useful incredibly useful So if an attacker can get through a So if an attacker can get through a So if an attacker can get through a network versus they have to physically network versus they have to physically network versus they have to physically be at the device that's a measure of how be at the device that's a measure of how be at the device that's a measure of how likely an attacker is going to be able likely an attacker is going to be able likely an attacker is going to be able to get to that device if the access to get to that device if the access to get to that device if the access complexity is high maybe a race complexity is high maybe a race complexity is high maybe a race condition needs to be fulfilled to do it condition needs to be fulfilled to do it condition needs to be fulfilled to do it that's a measure of like how likely this that's a measure of like how likely this that's a measure of like how likely this is going to be to be exploited on a box is going to be to be exploited on a box is going to be to be exploited on a box right so all of these things I think are right so all of these things I think are right so all of these things I think are good measures of at a very first order good measures of at a very first order good measures of at a very first order at a very rough order uh risk so at a very rough order uh risk so at a very rough order uh risk so speaking of risk um or speaking Speaking speaking of risk um or speaking Speaking speaking of risk um or speaking Speaking of rough, the measures themselves are um of rough, the measures themselves are um of rough, the measures themselves are um in fact there two or three or four in fact there two or three or four in fact there two or three or four levels for most of these metrics. Um levels for most of these metrics. Um levels for most of these metrics. Um there's a lot of documentation, but it there's a lot of documentation, but it there's a lot of documentation, but it kind of at the end we get to a really kind of at the end we get to a really kind of at the end we get to a really subjective measure for these. Um and the subjective measure for these. Um and the subjective measure for these. Um and the score compresses things, right? So score compresses things, right? So score compresses things, right? So CVSSV3 can uh expand into something like CVSSV3 can uh expand into something like CVSSV3 can uh expand into something like 6,000 vectors. Uh but we have a 100 6,000 vectors. Uh but we have a 100 6,000 vectors. Uh but we have a 100 scores. And I think this is often the scores. And I think this is often the scores. And I think this is often the cause of the ranker is because folks are cause of the ranker is because folks are cause of the ranker is because folks are like, h that's not a critical severity. like, h that's not a critical severity. like, h that's not a critical severity. That's not a 10. It's like at most an That's not a 10. It's like at most an That's not a 10. It's like at most an eight. Um but really the value is in eight. Um but really the value is in eight. Um but really the value is in these in these metrics. So um I'm a data these in these metrics. So um I'm a data these in these metrics. So um I'm a data scientist. So let's do a little bit of scientist. So let's do a little bit of scientist. So let's do a little bit of visualization. Um if we look at the visualization. Um if we look at the visualization. Um if we look at the impact score, this is just kind of impact score, this is just kind of impact score, this is just kind of demonstrating the bias towards more uh demonstrating the bias towards more uh demonstrating the bias towards more uh severe vulnerabilities. About twothirds severe vulnerabilities. About twothirds severe vulnerabilities. About twothirds of the vulnerabilities that we currently of the vulnerabilities that we currently of the vulnerabilities that we currently have CIA for are high high confidential have CIA for are high high confidential have CIA for are high high confidential integrity availability high. Um if we integrity availability high. Um if we integrity availability high. Um if we look at the CDSSV3 for the look at the CDSSV3 for the look at the CDSSV3 for the exploitability vector um about uh a exploitability vector um about uh a exploitability vector um about uh a quarter of them are actually this like quarter of them are actually this like quarter of them are actually this like network accessible low complexity network accessible low complexity network accessible low complexity privileges and required none um user privileges and required none um user privileges and required none um user interaction none. So these are this high interaction none. So these are this high interaction none. So these are this high severity vulnerabilities. So, um, rather severity vulnerabilities. So, um, rather severity vulnerabilities. So, um, rather than just claim this is a measure of than just claim this is a measure of than just claim this is a measure of risk, I'm going to try to put my money risk, I'm going to try to put my money risk, I'm going to try to put my money where my mouth is a little bit. Um, and where my mouth is a little bit. Um, and where my mouth is a little bit. Um, and say that if this is a measure of say that if this is a measure of say that if this is a measure of technical severity, it's a measure of technical severity, it's a measure of technical severity, it's a measure of the likelihood that a vulnerability um, the likelihood that a vulnerability um, the likelihood that a vulnerability um, is going to have an exploit developed, is going to have an exploit developed, is going to have an exploit developed, then we should see signal there. We then we should see signal there. We then we should see signal there. We should be able to take the CVSS vector should be able to take the CVSS vector should be able to take the CVSS vector and ask if there's going to be exploit and ask if there's going to be exploit and ask if there's going to be exploit code available soon. Because if a code available soon. Because if a code available soon. Because if a vulnerability has physical access vulnerability has physical access vulnerability has physical access requirements, then it's going to be requirements, then it's going to be requirements, then it's going to be harder for a attacker to have that harder for a attacker to have that harder for a attacker to have that physical device to test out their physical device to test out their physical device to test out their exploit. Right? So I did this. Um I am a exploit. Right? So I did this. Um I am a exploit. Right? So I did this. Um I am a data scientist. So I built a model. It's data scientist. So I built a model. It's data scientist. So I built a model. It's using a gradient boosted tree. Um and I using a gradient boosted tree. Um and I using a gradient boosted tree. Um and I just asked is the CDSS V3 vector can just asked is the CDSS V3 vector can just asked is the CDSS V3 vector can that predict proof of concept code that predict proof of concept code that predict proof of concept code exploitation? Um this is a receiver exploitation? Um this is a receiver exploitation? Um this is a receiver operator characteristic curve. This uh operator characteristic curve. This uh operator characteristic curve. This uh colored line kind of goes up. uh you colored line kind of goes up. uh you colored line kind of goes up. uh you don't have to know a ton other than up don't have to know a ton other than up don't have to know a ton other than up and to the left is better and if it was and to the left is better and if it was and to the left is better and if it was on that dotted line it would be bad. Um on that dotted line it would be bad. Um on that dotted line it would be bad. Um and so my point here is that this is not and so my point here is that this is not and so my point here is that this is not a perfect classifier but what it does is a perfect classifier but what it does is a perfect classifier but what it does is show that CVS does actually predict this show that CVS does actually predict this show that CVS does actually predict this real measure of risk which is exploit real measure of risk which is exploit real measure of risk which is exploit code availability. And so this is an code availability. And so this is an code availability. And so this is an early measure of risk that does not early measure of risk that does not early measure of risk that does not require a ton of external information. require a ton of external information. require a ton of external information. it's available very quickly. Um, and one it's available very quickly. Um, and one it's available very quickly. Um, and one that we should think about as a risk that we should think about as a risk that we should think about as a risk signal. So, this is my controversial signal. So, this is my controversial signal. So, this is my controversial take that CVS actually is uh a rough take that CVS actually is uh a rough take that CVS actually is uh a rough measure of risk. Um, I am also not the measure of risk. Um, I am also not the measure of risk. Um, I am also not the first one to do this. Others have done first one to do this. Others have done first one to do this. Others have done this and probably better. Uh, but this this and probably better. Uh, but this this and probably better. Uh, but this is this is my my take that this is is this is my my take that this is is this is my my take that this is actually a measure of actually a measure of actually a measure of risk. Um, there's a lot of other acronym risk. Um, there's a lot of other acronym risk. Um, there's a lot of other acronym measures. Let's talk about a few of measures. Let's talk about a few of measures. Let's talk about a few of them. Um, this is certainly a them. Um, this is certainly a them. Um, this is certainly a non-exhaustive list. Uh I'm going to non-exhaustive list. Uh I'm going to non-exhaustive list. Uh I'm going to talk about one and then hand it off to talk about one and then hand it off to talk about one and then hand it off to my colleague. Uh the other one is the S my colleague. Uh the other one is the S my colleague. Uh the other one is the S CVs cousin SSVC. Um I am going to argue CVs cousin SSVC. Um I am going to argue CVs cousin SSVC. Um I am going to argue that this is not actually a measure of that this is not actually a measure of that this is not actually a measure of risk. This is a risk assessment risk. This is a risk assessment risk. This is a risk assessment framework. Um this is developed by our framework. Um this is developed by our framework. Um this is developed by our friends at uh NIS or SIZA I'm sorry as friends at uh NIS or SIZA I'm sorry as friends at uh NIS or SIZA I'm sorry as well as Cert CC. Uh and the idea is well as Cert CC. Uh and the idea is well as Cert CC. Uh and the idea is there are these decision points that there are these decision points that there are these decision points that often map to CDSS sub vectors or or often map to CDSS sub vectors or or often map to CDSS sub vectors or or combinations of vectors and they tell us combinations of vectors and they tell us combinations of vectors and they tell us kind of what we should do uh whether we kind of what we should do uh whether we kind of what we should do uh whether we should act on it or just kind of track should act on it or just kind of track should act on it or just kind of track it uh for that vulnerability. Now I it uh for that vulnerability. Now I it uh for that vulnerability. Now I think this gets conflated with risk a think this gets conflated with risk a think this gets conflated with risk a lot because uh this DHS vulnerrichment lot because uh this DHS vulnerrichment lot because uh this DHS vulnerrichment program has included these decision program has included these decision program has included these decision points in a lot of their data. Uh but in points in a lot of their data. Uh but in points in a lot of their data. Uh but in itself SSVC is is not a measure of risk. itself SSVC is is not a measure of risk. itself SSVC is is not a measure of risk. But I'm going to hand it over to Sander But I'm going to hand it over to Sander But I'm going to hand it over to Sander who's going to talk about what is a who's going to talk about what is a who's going to talk about what is a measure of risk. measure of risk. measure of risk. All right. So I I expect probably most All right. So I I expect probably most All right. So I I expect probably most of the folks here are already familiar of the folks here are already familiar of the folks here are already familiar with the exploitation prediction scoring with the exploitation prediction scoring with the exploitation prediction scoring system EPSS of which the latest version system EPSS of which the latest version system EPSS of which the latest version version 4 just launched a few weeks ago. version 4 just launched a few weeks ago. version 4 just launched a few weeks ago. Um this is I would argue a a very robust Um this is I would argue a a very robust Um this is I would argue a a very robust measure of a subcomponent of measure of a subcomponent of measure of a subcomponent of vulnerability risk. Right? So we were vulnerability risk. Right? So we were vulnerability risk. Right? So we were just talking about the probability just talking about the probability just talking about the probability versus loss. What EPSS is very good at, versus loss. What EPSS is very good at, versus loss. What EPSS is very good at, I would argue better than other systems I would argue better than other systems I would argue better than other systems is at predicting specifically the is at predicting specifically the is at predicting specifically the likelihood that a CV is exploited likelihood that a CV is exploited likelihood that a CV is exploited anywhere in the world within the next 30 anywhere in the world within the next 30 anywhere in the world within the next 30 days. And it does this, this is another days. And it does this, this is another days. And it does this, this is another important distinction uh strictly by important distinction uh strictly by important distinction uh strictly by modeling vans based on the modeling vans based on the modeling vans based on the characteristics of those characteristics of those characteristics of those vulnerabilities. Right? So it uses vulnerabilities. Right? So it uses vulnerabilities. Right? So it uses actual exploitation events as training actual exploitation events as training actual exploitation events as training data as labels and supervised learning. data as labels and supervised learning. data as labels and supervised learning. But the runtime inputs for EPSS have But the runtime inputs for EPSS have But the runtime inputs for EPSS have nothing to do with threat actors and nothing to do with threat actors and nothing to do with threat actors and nothing to do with observed attacks. is nothing to do with observed attacks. is nothing to do with observed attacks. is how similar is this CVE in its various how similar is this CVE in its various how similar is this CVE in its various attributes to other CVEes that tend to attributes to other CVEes that tend to attributes to other CVEes that tend to get attacked uh significantly, right? Uh get attacked uh significantly, right? Uh get attacked uh significantly, right? Uh so so this is I would argue um a so so this is I would argue um a so so this is I would argue um a subcomponent or a measure of risk. And subcomponent or a measure of risk. And subcomponent or a measure of risk. And the other thing to note is I what we the other thing to note is I what we the other thing to note is I what we what we put up here is just a frequency what we put up here is just a frequency what we put up here is just a frequency distribution of EPSS scores on a log distribution of EPSS scores on a log distribution of EPSS scores on a log scale. Um and I and one important thing scale. Um and I and one important thing scale. Um and I and one important thing to recognize and and I just I mean on on to recognize and and I just I mean on on to recognize and and I just I mean on on a certain level just memorize the shape a certain level just memorize the shape a certain level just memorize the shape of this distribution. This is going to of this distribution. This is going to of this distribution. This is going to show up several more times in the talk. show up several more times in the talk. show up several more times in the talk. we're going to see this distribution we're going to see this distribution we're going to see this distribution sort of shaping many plots. But uh an sort of shaping many plots. But uh an sort of shaping many plots. But uh an important thing to note here is that the important thing to note here is that the important thing to note here is that the mode of this distribution is quite low. mode of this distribution is quite low. mode of this distribution is quite low. It's it's a half a percent. Right? Uh It's it's a half a percent. Right? Uh It's it's a half a percent. Right? Uh and and the the sort of if you if you and and the the sort of if you if you and and the the sort of if you if you expand it out to the shoulders of the expand it out to the shoulders of the expand it out to the shoulders of the mode is between about 0.1% uh and 1%. So mode is between about 0.1% uh and 1%. So mode is between about 0.1% uh and 1%. So the vast majority of UPSs scores are the vast majority of UPSs scores are the vast majority of UPSs scores are actually very very low. And then you see actually very very low. And then you see actually very very low. And then you see there's another sort of uh peak towards there's another sort of uh peak towards there's another sort of uh peak towards towards the end where you have this towards the end where you have this towards the end where you have this subset of vulnerabilities that actually subset of vulnerabilities that actually subset of vulnerabilities that actually have a very very high likelihood of have a very very high likelihood of have a very very high likelihood of imminent exploitation. imminent exploitation. imminent exploitation. There's of of course there are also There's of of course there are also There's of of course there are also various lists of known exploited various lists of known exploited various lists of known exploited vulnerabilities or kevs. The of course vulnerabilities or kevs. The of course vulnerabilities or kevs. The of course everybody knows about the syskev um but everybody knows about the syskev um but everybody knows about the syskev um but there are other ones and there are there there are other ones and there are there there are other ones and there are there are other kind of data sources that are other kind of data sources that are other kind of data sources that don't call themselves a kev but if you don't call themselves a kev but if you don't call themselves a kev but if you transform and flatten the data in the transform and flatten the data in the transform and flatten the data in the right way and then you can turn them right way and then you can turn them right way and then you can turn them into a kev right uh and and a couple into a kev right uh and and a couple into a kev right uh and and a couple important things to note is all of these important things to note is all of these important things to note is all of these kev lists are of different size. Um they kev lists are of different size. Um they kev lists are of different size. Um they they have a lot of intersection right they have a lot of intersection right they have a lot of intersection right there are there are lots of vone share there are there are lots of vone share there are there are lots of vone share between these particularly between the between these particularly between the between these particularly between the siz and the sysone enrichment kev um but siz and the sysone enrichment kev um but siz and the sysone enrichment kev um but uh they also have a wide distribution in uh they also have a wide distribution in uh they also have a wide distribution in terms of expected future exploitation terms of expected future exploitation terms of expected future exploitation rate and this is something that Jacobs rate and this is something that Jacobs rate and this is something that Jacobs from EPSS has has made very clear many from EPSS has has made very clear many from EPSS has has made very clear many times by analyzing exploitation data is times by analyzing exploitation data is times by analyzing exploitation data is that historical exploitation activity that historical exploitation activity that historical exploitation activity does not necessarily predict future does not necessarily predict future does not necessarily predict future exploitation activity. Right? it is exploitation activity. Right? it is exploitation activity. Right? it is actually possible and we have observed actually possible and we have observed actually possible and we have observed it where vulnerabilities that have been it where vulnerabilities that have been it where vulnerabilities that have been heavily exploited just kind of go dark heavily exploited just kind of go dark heavily exploited just kind of go dark for various reasons right uh so from the for various reasons right uh so from the for various reasons right uh so from the standpoint of is this a measure of risk standpoint of is this a measure of risk standpoint of is this a measure of risk I would say yes it is an imperfect I would say yes it is an imperfect I would say yes it is an imperfect measure of future exploitation measure of future exploitation measure of future exploitation probability it doesn't really tell us a probability it doesn't really tell us a probability it doesn't really tell us a ton about impact but it does cover a ton about impact but it does cover a ton about impact but it does cover a little bit about little bit about little bit about probability there's also the MITER probability there's also the MITER probability there's also the MITER attack framework which was originally attack framework which was originally attack framework which was originally designed by MITER to be sort of a designed by MITER to be sort of a designed by MITER to be sort of a standardized language for communicating standardized language for communicating standardized language for communicating about attacker behaviors between about attacker behaviors between about attacker behaviors between security practitioners so that we don't security practitioners so that we don't security practitioners so that we don't use this vague language like you saw in use this vague language like you saw in use this vague language like you saw in that quote pop a box, right? That that quote pop a box, right? That that quote pop a box, right? That doesn't tell us a lot if we're like, "Oh doesn't tell us a lot if we're like, "Oh doesn't tell us a lot if we're like, "Oh yeah, and then they popped the box." The yeah, and then they popped the box." The yeah, and then they popped the box." The idea is we decompose attacker behaviors idea is we decompose attacker behaviors idea is we decompose attacker behaviors into tactics and techniques so that we into tactics and techniques so that we into tactics and techniques so that we are all unequivocally clear about what are all unequivocally clear about what are all unequivocally clear about what happened during a specific attack. Um, happened during a specific attack. Um, happened during a specific attack. Um, and I I'm a big fan of the attack and I I'm a big fan of the attack and I I'm a big fan of the attack framework, but I will come up here and framework, but I will come up here and framework, but I will come up here and say it is not great for managing risk say it is not great for managing risk say it is not great for managing risk around vulnerabilities, and it is around vulnerabilities, and it is around vulnerabilities, and it is certainly not a measure of vulnerability certainly not a measure of vulnerability certainly not a measure of vulnerability risk. um mapping CVEes to tactics and risk. um mapping CVEes to tactics and risk. um mapping CVEes to tactics and techniques is incredibly laborious and techniques is incredibly laborious and techniques is incredibly laborious and all of the machine learning attempts all of the machine learning attempts all of the machine learning attempts that I know of have always used the that I know of have always used the that I know of have always used the exact same corpus of training data which exact same corpus of training data which exact same corpus of training data which was published by MITER several years ago was published by MITER several years ago was published by MITER several years ago and then abandoned. Um the the most and then abandoned. Um the the most and then abandoned. Um the the most important thing actually is that when important thing actually is that when important thing actually is that when you have like let's say in a perfect you have like let's say in a perfect you have like let's say in a perfect world you have attack chain mappings for world you have attack chain mappings for world you have attack chain mappings for all 260 odd thousand CVEes. Um these are all 260 odd thousand CVEes. Um these are all 260 odd thousand CVEes. Um these are still functionally sort of qualitative still functionally sort of qualitative still functionally sort of qualitative arguments that we still need an expert arguments that we still need an expert arguments that we still need an expert within an organization to say this kind within an organization to say this kind within an organization to say this kind of escalation of privilege or an LSAS of escalation of privilege or an LSAS of escalation of privilege or an LSAS dump would be disastrous for us or maybe dump would be disastrous for us or maybe dump would be disastrous for us or maybe you say an Elsas dump is not disastrous you say an Elsas dump is not disastrous you say an Elsas dump is not disastrous for us. So MITER attack is for us. So MITER attack is for us. So MITER attack is extraordinarily interesting. I know extraordinarily interesting. I know extraordinarily interesting. I know there are a lot of future development there are a lot of future development there are a lot of future development efforts going on with ML around attack. efforts going on with ML around attack. efforts going on with ML around attack. Um but I would argue in its current Um but I would argue in its current Um but I would argue in its current state right now not really a robust uh state right now not really a robust uh state right now not really a robust uh measure of vulnerability measure of vulnerability measure of vulnerability risk. Uh there is also oh uh there is risk. Uh there is also oh uh there is risk. Uh there is also oh uh there is also the question of of software also the question of of software also the question of of software criticality. Sorry for that. That that's criticality. Sorry for that. That that's criticality. Sorry for that. That that's what you get when you try to export from what you get when you try to export from what you get when you try to export from Google slides into PowerPoint. Um the Google slides into PowerPoint. Um the Google slides into PowerPoint. Um the question of software criticality. Uh we question of software criticality. Uh we question of software criticality. Uh we have spent a lot of time trying to come have spent a lot of time trying to come have spent a lot of time trying to come up with robust measures of asset up with robust measures of asset up with robust measures of asset importance. It turns out to be a very importance. It turns out to be a very importance. It turns out to be a very complicated question if you're trying to complicated question if you're trying to complicated question if you're trying to measure that at scale from the outside. measure that at scale from the outside. measure that at scale from the outside. Uh so let's pick some really simple kind Uh so let's pick some really simple kind Uh so let's pick some really simple kind of stupid measurements of of software of stupid measurements of of software of stupid measurements of of software criticality and just talk about uh criticality and just talk about uh criticality and just talk about uh exploits against vulnerabilities in exploits against vulnerabilities in exploits against vulnerabilities in security software itself, right? We can security software itself, right? We can security software itself, right? We can kind of determine security software and kind of determine security software and kind of determine security software and hardware is probably pretty critical hardware is probably pretty critical hardware is probably pretty critical because it also determines the security because it also determines the security because it also determines the security of all the other stuff there. And we can of all the other stuff there. And we can of all the other stuff there. And we can we we know that it's deemed to be we we know that it's deemed to be we we know that it's deemed to be critical because every week we see critical because every week we see critical because every week we see another article about exploits against another article about exploits against another article about exploits against security stuff. So here's a Palo Alto W security stuff. So here's a Palo Alto W security stuff. So here's a Palo Alto W getting hit. Uh here's attackers going getting hit. Uh here's attackers going getting hit. Uh here's attackers going after an F5 big IP. Here is uh Siza after an F5 big IP. Here is uh Siza after an F5 big IP. Here is uh Siza warning about exploitation against warning about exploitation against warning about exploitation against Forinet. Um the 40 OS which is in a Forinet. Um the 40 OS which is in a Forinet. Um the 40 OS which is in a bunch of SSLVPNs as well as I think a W. bunch of SSLVPNs as well as I think a W. bunch of SSLVPNs as well as I think a W. Uh and then Sonic Walls SSLVPN getting Uh and then Sonic Walls SSLVPN getting Uh and then Sonic Walls SSLVPN getting hit, right? So how good is this at hit, right? So how good is this at hit, right? So how good is this at assessing vulnerability risk? Well, it assessing vulnerability risk? Well, it assessing vulnerability risk? Well, it tells us a lot about loss and the impact tells us a lot about loss and the impact tells us a lot about loss and the impact of a loss, right? it doesn't and it of a loss, right? it doesn't and it of a loss, right? it doesn't and it tells us a little bit about um tells us a little bit about um tells us a little bit about um likelihood of exploitation but I would likelihood of exploitation but I would likelihood of exploitation but I would also argue based on what I've seen and I also argue based on what I've seen and I also argue based on what I've seen and I was actually working at F5 when we when was actually working at F5 when we when was actually working at F5 when we when we dropped a couple of big uh or we dropped a couple of big uh or we dropped a couple of big uh or significant big IP vans uh it is an significant big IP vans uh it is an significant big IP vans uh it is an imperfect predictor and I would say we imperfect predictor and I would say we imperfect predictor and I would say we would have to get a lot more resolution would have to get a lot more resolution would have to get a lot more resolution into the signal before we start using into the signal before we start using into the signal before we start using this actually sort prior prioritize this actually sort prior prioritize this actually sort prior prioritize vulnerabilities for remediation okay so vulnerabilities for remediation okay so vulnerabilities for remediation okay so what else what else can we do right so what else what else can we do right so what else what else can we do right so that's everything we know about current that's everything we know about current that's everything we know about current measures uh what else can we do so first measures uh what else can we do so first measures uh what else can we do so first like I said, we're going to look at uh like I said, we're going to look at uh like I said, we're going to look at uh organizational measures. So measures organizational measures. So measures organizational measures. So measures about vulnerabilities within a certain about vulnerabilities within a certain about vulnerabilities within a certain organization's footprint, right? And so organization's footprint, right? And so organization's footprint, right? And so we're going to look at vulnerability we're going to look at vulnerability we're going to look at vulnerability prevalence. We're going to look at prevalence. We're going to look at prevalence. We're going to look at remediation time, attacker remediation time, attacker remediation time, attacker sophistication, sophistication, sophistication, uh in terms of what kinds of threat uh in terms of what kinds of threat uh in terms of what kinds of threat actors are going after your environment actors are going after your environment actors are going after your environment as well as loss types of which the as well as loss types of which the as well as loss types of which the simplest one to model is CVs associated simplest one to model is CVs associated simplest one to model is CVs associated with ransomware. And then we want to with ransomware. And then we want to with ransomware. And then we want to broaden that, apply all four of those broaden that, apply all four of those broaden that, apply all four of those organizational measures to the entire organizational measures to the entire organizational measures to the entire global CV footprint, see what that tells global CV footprint, see what that tells global CV footprint, see what that tells us. and then also look at proliferation us. and then also look at proliferation us. and then also look at proliferation across different software packages, across different software packages, across different software packages, vulnerability concentration and uh vulnerability concentration and uh vulnerability concentration and uh critical supply chain providers. So critical supply chain providers. So critical supply chain providers. So quick note on our measurement data and quick note on our measurement data and quick note on our measurement data and kind of where this all comes from. Uh we kind of where this all comes from. Uh we kind of where this all comes from. Uh we have a couple public data sources in have a couple public data sources in have a couple public data sources in this presentation. We have the CV list this presentation. We have the CV list this presentation. We have the CV list and provided data from MITER. Uh we have and provided data from MITER. Uh we have and provided data from MITER. Uh we have some data from the some data from the some data from the Volcss which is public. Uh and in terms Volcss which is public. Uh and in terms Volcss which is public. Uh and in terms of private data, we have a ton of data of private data, we have a ton of data of private data, we have a ton of data from Bitsite's own internet scanning from Bitsite's own internet scanning from Bitsite's own internet scanning platform which is called Groma. Uh you platform which is called Groma. Uh you platform which is called Groma. Uh you can sort of think of Groma as roughly can sort of think of Groma as roughly can sort of think of Groma as roughly parallel to Showdan. We kind of have our parallel to Showdan. We kind of have our parallel to Showdan. We kind of have our own version of Showdan. Uh it's own version of Showdan. Uh it's own version of Showdan. Uh it's technically different in terms of technically different in terms of technically different in terms of architecture, has a little bit more architecture, has a little bit more architecture, has a little bit more coverage in some respects, a little bit coverage in some respects, a little bit coverage in some respects, a little bit less coverage in some other respects. If less coverage in some other respects. If less coverage in some other respects. If you'd like to know more about Groma, uh you'd like to know more about Groma, uh you'd like to know more about Groma, uh there is a blog article that talks about there is a blog article that talks about there is a blog article that talks about how it works a little bit under the how it works a little bit under the how it works a little bit under the hood. If you just search Bitsite Groma, hood. If you just search Bitsite Groma, hood. If you just search Bitsite Groma, you'll you'll find it is from last June. you'll you'll find it is from last June. you'll you'll find it is from last June. Um, but in a nutshell, what Groma Um, but in a nutshell, what Groma Um, but in a nutshell, what Groma provides us data about is more than 40 provides us data about is more than 40 provides us data about is more than 40 million organizations, 2.7 billion host million organizations, 2.7 billion host million organizations, 2.7 billion host names, 4.9 billion routable IP names, 4.9 billion routable IP names, 4.9 billion routable IP addresses, which is the entire IPv4 addresses, which is the entire IPv4 addresses, which is the entire IPv4 space, plus 600 million IPv6 addresses. space, plus 600 million IPv6 addresses. space, plus 600 million IPv6 addresses. Um, and there's a a kind of a note, this Um, and there's a a kind of a note, this Um, and there's a a kind of a note, this is something I've been I've been sort of is something I've been I've been sort of is something I've been I've been sort of um really kind of belaboring this point um really kind of belaboring this point um really kind of belaboring this point within Bitsite, which is that uh there's within Bitsite, which is that uh there's within Bitsite, which is that uh there's a lot of discussion these days about a lot of discussion these days about a lot of discussion these days about reachability analysis in the context of reachability analysis in the context of reachability analysis in the context of vulnerabilities and and that if that the vulnerabilities and and that if that the vulnerabilities and and that if that the reachability analysis should factor into reachability analysis should factor into reachability analysis should factor into our prioritization of it because if you our prioritization of it because if you our prioritization of it because if you can reach it, so can an attacker, right? can reach it, so can an attacker, right? can reach it, so can an attacker, right? And so to some degree, to a rough And so to some degree, to a rough And so to some degree, to a rough degree, I think that Groma is actually a degree, I think that Groma is actually a degree, I think that Groma is actually a good quick and dirty reachability good quick and dirty reachability good quick and dirty reachability analysis. If Bitsite can see your assets analysis. If Bitsite can see your assets analysis. If Bitsite can see your assets and can fingerprint a CVE on that asset, and can fingerprint a CVE on that asset, and can fingerprint a CVE on that asset, so can an attacker. And that's I think so can an attacker. And that's I think so can an attacker. And that's I think one of the things that makes the Groma one of the things that makes the Groma one of the things that makes the Groma data particularly interesting in spite data particularly interesting in spite data particularly interesting in spite of all of its limitations. We also have of all of its limitations. We also have of all of its limitations. We also have a little bit of data from Cyber Six who a little bit of data from Cyber Six who a little bit of data from Cyber Six who are recently uh new colleagues at are recently uh new colleagues at are recently uh new colleagues at Bitsite. Um this is cyber threat Bitsite. Um this is cyber threat Bitsite. Um this is cyber threat intelligence based on observations on intelligence based on observations on intelligence based on observations on the dark uh deep web and dark web. And the dark uh deep web and dark web. And the dark uh deep web and dark web. And we also have a little bit of data, we also have a little bit of data, we also have a little bit of data, excuse me, from the uh empirical excuse me, from the uh empirical excuse me, from the uh empirical security global model. This is a sort of security global model. This is a sort of security global model. This is a sort of transformed version of the same training transformed version of the same training transformed version of the same training data that goes into EPSS which we are data that goes into EPSS which we are data that goes into EPSS which we are licensing from empirical security. Uh licensing from empirical security. Uh licensing from empirical security. Uh empirical security will also license empirical security will also license empirical security will also license that data to you. So if you are that data to you. So if you are that data to you. So if you are interested and you say I would like to interested and you say I would like to interested and you say I would like to see that training data then go talk to see that training data then go talk to see that training data then go talk to Jacobs or some of his colleagues around Jacobs or some of his colleagues around Jacobs or some of his colleagues around here. And uh oh yeah this is still me. here. And uh oh yeah this is still me. here. And uh oh yeah this is still me. So okay let's dig into those local So okay let's dig into those local So okay let's dig into those local measures. Um okay here's a blindingly measures. Um okay here's a blindingly measures. Um okay here's a blindingly obvious kind of a stupidly obvious obvious kind of a stupidly obvious obvious kind of a stupidly obvious statement but if you don't have a statement but if you don't have a statement but if you don't have a vulnerability it risk to you is very vulnerability it risk to you is very vulnerability it risk to you is very low. Right? problem is that it's low. Right? problem is that it's low. Right? problem is that it's actually a little bit harder than it actually a little bit harder than it actually a little bit harder than it might seem to say with utter confidence might seem to say with utter confidence might seem to say with utter confidence that you don't have that vulnerability that you don't have that vulnerability that you don't have that vulnerability and vulnerability footprint measurement and vulnerability footprint measurement and vulnerability footprint measurement turns out to be a deeply technical task. turns out to be a deeply technical task. turns out to be a deeply technical task. Um, and so what you see here, this is a Um, and so what you see here, this is a Um, and so what you see here, this is a frequency histogram of global CV frequency histogram of global CV frequency histogram of global CV footprint. So this is across all footprint. So this is across all footprint. So this is across all entities per CVE. Um, and so the the entities per CVE. Um, and so the the entities per CVE. Um, and so the the first thing to note here is you'll first thing to note here is you'll first thing to note here is you'll notice that this x-axis is based on new notice that this x-axis is based on new notice that this x-axis is based on new detections per month, not total CVE detections per month, not total CVE detections per month, not total CVE detections per month. um don't want to detections per month. um don't want to detections per month. um don't want to spend a ton of time on this. This is the spend a ton of time on this. This is the spend a ton of time on this. This is the the long and short of it is uh measuring the long and short of it is uh measuring the long and short of it is uh measuring vulnerabilities on the internet is vulnerabilities on the internet is vulnerabilities on the internet is actually a deeply complicated thing. actually a deeply complicated thing. actually a deeply complicated thing. There's the problem of kind of duplicate There's the problem of kind of duplicate There's the problem of kind of duplicate measures depending on your scan cadence, measures depending on your scan cadence, measures depending on your scan cadence, depending on how long that vulnerability depending on how long that vulnerability depending on how long that vulnerability has been out there. After working on has been out there. After working on has been out there. After working on this problem for a long time, Ben has this problem for a long time, Ben has this problem for a long time, Ben has concluded new detections per month is concluded new detections per month is concluded new detections per month is probably the most reliable way to get probably the most reliable way to get probably the most reliable way to get month by month a good count of how many month by month a good count of how many month by month a good count of how many of these vans are actually out there. Uh of these vans are actually out there. Uh of these vans are actually out there. Uh so note that the mode of this so note that the mode of this so note that the mode of this distribution is right around kind of 100 distribution is right around kind of 100 distribution is right around kind of 100 to a thousand new detections per month to a thousand new detections per month to a thousand new detections per month which is a lot smaller than I thought. I which is a lot smaller than I thought. I which is a lot smaller than I thought. I thought we were going to see tons and thought we were going to see tons and thought we were going to see tons and tons of CVEes with 100,000 or 500,000 uh tons of CVEes with 100,000 or 500,000 uh tons of CVEes with 100,000 or 500,000 uh instances out there. Turns out that most instances out there. Turns out that most instances out there. Turns out that most of those really really prevalent of those really really prevalent of those really really prevalent vulnerabilities are either server vulnerabilities are either server vulnerabilities are either server vulnerabilities like Apache HTTP server vulnerabilities like Apache HTTP server vulnerabilities like Apache HTTP server uh or in one case jQuery 3.0 a cross-ite uh or in one case jQuery 3.0 a cross-ite uh or in one case jQuery 3.0 a cross-ite scripting bone from 2015 shows up about scripting bone from 2015 shows up about scripting bone from 2015 shows up about a million times per month. That is the a million times per month. That is the a million times per month. That is the most frequently observed CVE we ever see most frequently observed CVE we ever see most frequently observed CVE we ever see at least these days. at least these days. at least these days. You Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Thank you. So, You Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Thank you. So, You Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Thank you. So, uh those vans, those those Apache vans uh those vans, those those Apache vans uh those vans, those those Apache vans and that jQuery vone, keep that in mind. and that jQuery vone, keep that in mind. and that jQuery vone, keep that in mind. That's going to show up in the upper That's going to show up in the upper That's going to show up in the upper right of quite a few plots as we go on right of quite a few plots as we go on right of quite a few plots as we go on and we kind of decompose this data. So, and we kind of decompose this data. So, and we kind of decompose this data. So, keep those in mind. uh you would also keep those in mind. uh you would also keep those in mind. uh you would also expect that there would be a expect that there would be a expect that there would be a relationship between the size of the relationship between the size of the relationship between the size of the organization which we're sort of mapping organization which we're sort of mapping organization which we're sort of mapping here onto the number of employees and here onto the number of employees and here onto the number of employees and the the kind of the the CV footprint the the kind of the the CV footprint the the kind of the the CV footprint which we're measuring in terms of new which we're measuring in terms of new which we're measuring in terms of new detections per month. And the short detections per month. And the short detections per month. And the short version is yes there's a relationship version is yes there's a relationship version is yes there's a relationship but it's not as strong as we might have but it's not as strong as we might have but it's not as strong as we might have expected. There are quite a few very expected. There are quite a few very expected. There are quite a few very very large organizations that don't have very large organizations that don't have very large organizations that don't have that many CVEs. There are also quite a that many CVEs. There are also quite a that many CVEs. There are also quite a few tiny little organizations that have few tiny little organizations that have few tiny little organizations that have tons of CVEes. Um, you'll also note that tons of CVEes. Um, you'll also note that tons of CVEes. Um, you'll also note that kind of by the the density of this kind of by the the density of this kind of by the the density of this density plot that the vast majority of density plot that the vast majority of density plot that the vast majority of organizations are kind of all clustered organizations are kind of all clustered organizations are kind of all clustered around this range of kind of between 50 around this range of kind of between 50 around this range of kind of between 50 to 500 employees and between one and a to 500 employees and between one and a to 500 employees and between one and a thousand uh new detections across all thousand uh new detections across all thousand uh new detections across all CVS in their footprint. All right, so a correlary to footprint. All right, so a correlary to footprint. All right, so a correlary to that last obvious point is the next that last obvious point is the next that last obvious point is the next obvious point which is the faster you obvious point which is the faster you obvious point which is the faster you fix something the lower you risk. Right? fix something the lower you risk. Right? fix something the lower you risk. Right? So the faster organizations are able to So the faster organizations are able to So the faster organizations are able to remediate vans, um attackers are just remediate vans, um attackers are just remediate vans, um attackers are just not going to get to them in time. Uh so not going to get to them in time. Uh so not going to get to them in time. Uh so this is actually something we can also this is actually something we can also this is actually something we can also measure. And so we have another measure. And so we have another measure. And so we have another frequency histogram that looks frequency histogram that looks frequency histogram that looks remarkably similar to the last. So what remarkably similar to the last. So what remarkably similar to the last. So what we did is we we took the catalog of we did is we we took the catalog of we did is we we took the catalog of approximately 16,000 CVEes that uh we approximately 16,000 CVEes that uh we approximately 16,000 CVEes that uh we scan for and we looked at the scan for and we looked at the scan for and we looked at the remediation time, remediation survival remediation time, remediation survival remediation time, remediation survival curves of those CVEes that we saw across curves of those CVEes that we saw across curves of those CVEes that we saw across organizations. Um the median remediation organizations. Um the median remediation organizations. Um the median remediation time is a way to summarize those time is a way to summarize those time is a way to summarize those survival curves and it gives us the time survival curves and it gives us the time survival curves and it gives us the time it takes for organizations to fix 50% of it takes for organizations to fix 50% of it takes for organizations to fix 50% of the vaults. So each of the things in the vaults. So each of the things in the vaults. So each of the things in here is the is the percent of CVEs. here is the is the percent of CVEs. here is the is the percent of CVEs. That's the CVE. What you'll notice is That's the CVE. What you'll notice is That's the CVE. What you'll notice is that most of them get fixed in about a that most of them get fixed in about a that most of them get fixed in about a month, maybe a month and a half. Um and month, maybe a month and a half. Um and month, maybe a month and a half. Um and beyond that there's a steep drop off. beyond that there's a steep drop off. beyond that there's a steep drop off. Now I will say this chart goes out to Now I will say this chart goes out to Now I will say this chart goes out to nine months. And though you can't see nine months. And though you can't see nine months. And though you can't see it, there are points out here at nine it, there are points out here at nine it, there are points out here at nine months. And in fact, I've even cut it months. And in fact, I've even cut it months. And in fact, I've even cut it off a little bit here. Uh there should off a little bit here. Uh there should off a little bit here. Uh there should be points way over there um that go out be points way over there um that go out be points way over there um that go out about nine years. There are uh about nine years. There are uh about nine years. There are uh vulnerabilities that we've seen uh since vulnerabilities that we've seen uh since vulnerabilities that we've seen uh since Bitsite has started scanning. Uh they Bitsite has started scanning. Uh they Bitsite has started scanning. Uh they tend to be like SSL vans, like somebody tend to be like SSL vans, like somebody tend to be like SSL vans, like somebody has a server that's uh uh valid for SSL has a server that's uh uh valid for SSL has a server that's uh uh valid for SSL 1.0. Um and then you know that's that's 1.0. Um and then you know that's that's 1.0. Um and then you know that's that's vulnerable to poodle and all kinds of vulnerable to poodle and all kinds of vulnerable to poodle and all kinds of things. Um there are other remediations. things. Um there are other remediations. things. Um there are other remediations. It may not be a huge risk. Uh but the It may not be a huge risk. Uh but the It may not be a huge risk. Uh but the idea is that the faster that you can fix idea is that the faster that you can fix idea is that the faster that you can fix things that the the lower the risk is. things that the the lower the risk is. things that the the lower the risk is. But there are also some vulnerabilities But there are also some vulnerabilities But there are also some vulnerabilities that for some reason inherently take that for some reason inherently take that for some reason inherently take longer to fix. Um it may be because you longer to fix. Um it may be because you longer to fix. Um it may be because you have to update firmware. You have to have to update firmware. You have to have to update firmware. You have to take something offline to actually fix take something offline to actually fix take something offline to actually fix it uh as opposed to just kind of pushing it uh as opposed to just kind of pushing it uh as opposed to just kind of pushing something to your your consumer's something to your your consumer's something to your your consumer's laptop, your user's laptop. Um so uh laptop, your user's laptop. Um so uh laptop, your user's laptop. Um so uh knowing that it's going to take a long knowing that it's going to take a long knowing that it's going to take a long time to fix is actually a decent risk time to fix is actually a decent risk time to fix is actually a decent risk signal. So the question is are people signal. So the question is are people signal. So the question is are people integrating this idea of hey I need to integrating this idea of hey I need to integrating this idea of hey I need to fix worse things faster. Um and the fix worse things faster. Um and the fix worse things faster. Um and the answer is yes. Um again I'll go back to answer is yes. Um again I'll go back to answer is yes. Um again I'll go back to CVSS. People are using CVSS as a risk CVSS. People are using CVSS as a risk CVSS. People are using CVSS as a risk signal and they tend to fix critical signal and they tend to fix critical signal and they tend to fix critical CVEs and high CVES much much more CVEs and high CVES much much more CVEs and high CVES much much more quickly than medium and low CVES. Um I quickly than medium and low CVES. Um I quickly than medium and low CVES. Um I don't know that this is like uh this is don't know that this is like uh this is don't know that this is like uh this is a more a reflection of people are are a more a reflection of people are are a more a reflection of people are are using CVSS rather than CVSS is the right using CVSS rather than CVSS is the right using CVSS rather than CVSS is the right thing to use. How about that? thing to use. How about that? thing to use. How about that? Um and so uh we do see variation there. Um and so uh we do see variation there. Um and so uh we do see variation there. So the next one I want to look at is So the next one I want to look at is So the next one I want to look at is EPSS is the maybe this more exact EPSS is the maybe this more exact EPSS is the maybe this more exact measure of risk. Um and it turns out measure of risk. Um and it turns out measure of risk. Um and it turns out that the remediation time is not that the remediation time is not that the remediation time is not correlated with this likelihood of correlated with this likelihood of correlated with this likelihood of exploitation. So people are not actually exploitation. So people are not actually exploitation. So people are not actually um pivoting on this likelihood of um pivoting on this likelihood of um pivoting on this likelihood of exploitation in the next 30 days to fix exploitation in the next 30 days to fix exploitation in the next 30 days to fix things faster. And in particular, if things faster. And in particular, if things faster. And in particular, if you'll note where most of our density you'll note where most of our density you'll note where most of our density was in uh you know around here for the was in uh you know around here for the was in uh you know around here for the EPSS score, um that's kind of the EPSS score, um that's kind of the EPSS score, um that's kind of the average that one month one and a half average that one month one and a half average that one month one and a half months. Uh but there's a lot of months. Uh but there's a lot of months. Uh but there's a lot of variation of course uh but interestingly variation of course uh but interestingly variation of course uh but interestingly at this top end at this 100 you know at this top end at this 100 you know at this top end at this 100 you know near 100% near certainty of exploitation near 100% near certainty of exploitation near 100% near certainty of exploitation um there's a lot of variance. So there um there's a lot of variance. So there um there's a lot of variance. So there are these organiza there are these are these organiza there are these are these organiza there are these vulnerabilities that seem to take an vulnerabilities that seem to take an vulnerabilities that seem to take an extremely long time to fix but for some extremely long time to fix but for some extremely long time to fix but for some reason just stick around for a very very reason just stick around for a very very reason just stick around for a very very very very long time. Uh so these uh very very long time. Uh so these uh very very long time. Uh so these uh represent like imminent risk like you represent like imminent risk like you represent like imminent risk like you should be fixing these faster because should be fixing these faster because should be fixing these faster because they're going to be exploited right. Um they're going to be exploited right. Um they're going to be exploited right. Um and so this is this is something we need and so this is this is something we need and so this is this is something we need to look at the reasons why these to look at the reasons why these to look at the reasons why these vulnerabilities are hard to fix and try vulnerabilities are hard to fix and try vulnerabilities are hard to fix and try to address that as one measure that we to address that as one measure that we to address that as one measure that we could address as risk. Man, I'm really could address as risk. Man, I'm really could address as risk. Man, I'm really disappointed in our export now. What are disappointed in our export now. What are disappointed in our export now. What are you gonna do? Uh, so the next thing I you gonna do? Uh, so the next thing I you gonna do? Uh, so the next thing I want to move on to is the folks who are want to move on to is the folks who are want to move on to is the folks who are actually hitting those those actually hitting those those actually hitting those those vulnerabilities. And to say that some vulnerabilities. And to say that some vulnerabilities. And to say that some attackers are more sophisticated in attackers are more sophisticated in attackers are more sophisticated in another than others. And in fact, some another than others. And in fact, some another than others. And in fact, some are so sophisticated they get cool are so sophisticated they get cool are so sophisticated they get cool names. Uh, like fluffy unicorn, I think, names. Uh, like fluffy unicorn, I think, names. Uh, like fluffy unicorn, I think, is a is a good one. Adorable panda is is a is a good one. Adorable panda is is a is a good one. Adorable panda is another AP. Um, and so what we wanted to another AP. Um, and so what we wanted to another AP. Um, and so what we wanted to look at is look at those KV lists and look at is look at those KV lists and look at is look at those KV lists and see if any of these are actually used by see if any of these are actually used by see if any of these are actually used by APS. Are they are they used by advanced APS. Are they are they used by advanced APS. Are they are they used by advanced persistent threats? Um, so if you persistent threats? Um, so if you persistent threats? Um, so if you remember that circle plot from last remember that circle plot from last remember that circle plot from last time, we actually broke down those CVEEs time, we actually broke down those CVEEs time, we actually broke down those CVEEs by which ones um have uh we have threat by which ones um have uh we have threat by which ones um have uh we have threat intelligence on that says an AP is intelligence on that says an AP is intelligence on that says an AP is actually using this in their actually using this in their actually using this in their exploitation attempts, in their root exploitation attempts, in their root exploitation attempts, in their root kits, uh, things like that. And the kits, uh, things like that. And the kits, uh, things like that. And the thing that's interesting to me is there thing that's interesting to me is there thing that's interesting to me is there seems to be a low subset of seems to be a low subset of seems to be a low subset of vulnerabilities that is actually used by vulnerabilities that is actually used by vulnerabilities that is actually used by APS and they make up kind of a constant APS and they make up kind of a constant APS and they make up kind of a constant number but like an increasingly low number but like an increasingly low number but like an increasingly low fraction of these KEV lists. And so fraction of these KEV lists. And so fraction of these KEV lists. And so essentially some uh like and then RS at essentially some uh like and then RS at essentially some uh like and then RS at the end this like darkware cyber six the end this like darkware cyber six the end this like darkware cyber six skills dark web exploitation it is the skills dark web exploitation it is the skills dark web exploitation it is the the highest percentage because well the highest percentage because well the highest percentage because well that's where the data is derived right that's where the data is derived right that's where the data is derived right we're already looking at those APS so we're already looking at those APS so we're already looking at those APS so it's no wonder that a high percentage of it's no wonder that a high percentage of it's no wonder that a high percentage of them are um so this says even if you're them are um so this says even if you're them are um so this says even if you're using these kev lists to kind of using these kev lists to kind of using these kev lists to kind of prioritize and say these are the ones I prioritize and say these are the ones I prioritize and say these are the ones I got to worry about you can refine even got to worry about you can refine even got to worry about you can refine even better and maybe you want to prioritize better and maybe you want to prioritize better and maybe you want to prioritize ones where the attacker has slightly ones where the attacker has slightly ones where the attacker has slightly more sophistication uh than than just more sophistication uh than than just more sophistication uh than than just kind of a commodity scanner. kind of a commodity scanner. kind of a commodity scanner. Um, we also wanted to look at are these Um, we also wanted to look at are these Um, we also wanted to look at are these attackers focusing on things that attackers focusing on things that attackers focusing on things that already have wide exploitation. So what already have wide exploitation. So what already have wide exploitation. So what this is is we have information about this is is we have information about this is is we have information about each attacker's country of origin or each attacker's country of origin or each attacker's country of origin or region of origin uh rather. And what region of origin uh rather. And what region of origin uh rather. And what this shows is the distribution of EPSS this shows is the distribution of EPSS this shows is the distribution of EPSS scores uh for the CVEEs that attackers scores uh for the CVEEs that attackers scores uh for the CVEEs that attackers in that region use. Um the blue lines in that region use. Um the blue lines in that region use. Um the blue lines here are that reference distribution here are that reference distribution here are that reference distribution that um Sandra showed earlier. I forgot that um Sandra showed earlier. I forgot that um Sandra showed earlier. I forgot your name for a second, man. Um, that your name for a second, man. Um, that your name for a second, man. Um, that reference distribution of EPSS. So, reference distribution of EPSS. So, reference distribution of EPSS. So, there's a couple interesting things there's a couple interesting things there's a couple interesting things here. First of all, almost all the for here. First of all, almost all the for here. First of all, almost all the for any region, we see this spike at 100 at any region, we see this spike at 100 at any region, we see this spike at 100 at near the high EPSS uh uh level. So, near the high EPSS uh uh level. So, near the high EPSS uh uh level. So, these are focused on vulnerabilities these are focused on vulnerabilities these are focused on vulnerabilities that we know are exploited in the wild. that we know are exploited in the wild. that we know are exploited in the wild. EPSS is actually kind of catching these EPSS is actually kind of catching these EPSS is actually kind of catching these ones. Um, but in the sense there's a lot ones. Um, but in the sense there's a lot ones. Um, but in the sense there's a lot of also vulnerabilities that are down at of also vulnerabilities that are down at of also vulnerabilities that are down at this lower level. So like APS are this lower level. So like APS are this lower level. So like APS are claiming to use these uh CVEes or at claiming to use these uh CVEes or at claiming to use these uh CVEes or at least talk about them or talk about least talk about them or talk about least talk about them or talk about using them um but they have low using them um but they have low using them um but they have low probability of exploitation. So this is probability of exploitation. So this is probability of exploitation. So this is saying that even though an EPSS score is saying that even though an EPSS score is saying that even though an EPSS score is low there may be a sophisticated low there may be a sophisticated low there may be a sophisticated attacker who's willing to use it. Um it attacker who's willing to use it. Um it attacker who's willing to use it. Um it also means like you know these also means like you know these also means like you know these sophisticated attackers or maybe a small sophisticated attackers or maybe a small sophisticated attackers or maybe a small subset. Uh so maybe that also reduces subset. Uh so maybe that also reduces subset. Uh so maybe that also reduces the probability but this is again all the probability but this is again all the probability but this is again all that context that we need to consider um that context that we need to consider um that context that we need to consider um when looking at these things. Um, the when looking at these things. Um, the when looking at these things. Um, the other thing I think is interesting, so other thing I think is interesting, so other thing I think is interesting, so other actors, this is kind of includes other actors, this is kind of includes other actors, this is kind of includes cyber crime. I noticed that that is like cyber crime. I noticed that that is like cyber crime. I noticed that that is like almost the one that's closest to the almost the one that's closest to the almost the one that's closest to the actual distribution. Uh, Russian threat actual distribution. Uh, Russian threat actual distribution. Uh, Russian threat actors tend to be kind of cyber crimey, actors tend to be kind of cyber crimey, actors tend to be kind of cyber crimey, too. And so they're they're close to the too. And so they're they're close to the too. And so they're they're close to the actual overall distribution of CDEs, actual overall distribution of CDEs, actual overall distribution of CDEs, which I think is interesting. Uh, which I think is interesting. Uh, which I think is interesting. Uh, meanwhile, our friends in the Middle meanwhile, our friends in the Middle meanwhile, our friends in the Middle East and and our our NATO allies um tend East and and our our NATO allies um tend East and and our our NATO allies um tend to focus on these ones that have high to focus on these ones that have high to focus on these ones that have high exploitation. They they don't use the exploitation. They they don't use the exploitation. They they don't use the commodity ones as much. commodity ones as much. commodity ones as much. Um, so moving on from ABTS, I want to Um, so moving on from ABTS, I want to Um, so moving on from ABTS, I want to talk about talk about talk about ransomware. Uh, particularly because ransomware. Uh, particularly because ransomware. Uh, particularly because this has like direct exploitation this has like direct exploitation this has like direct exploitation consequences. If you get hit with consequences. If you get hit with consequences. If you get hit with ransomware, you're going to be paying ransomware, you're going to be paying ransomware, you're going to be paying money. Uh, whether it's to the money. Uh, whether it's to the money. Uh, whether it's to the ransomware gang or to remediation or to ransomware gang or to remediation or to ransomware gang or to remediation or to a negotiator to get your stuff back. Um, a negotiator to get your stuff back. Um, a negotiator to get your stuff back. Um, and so I think this is like an immediate and so I think this is like an immediate and so I think this is like an immediate loss. So I recreated the chart before to loss. So I recreated the chart before to loss. So I recreated the chart before to say that again these KV lists provide us say that again these KV lists provide us say that again these KV lists provide us like partial views into what's actually like partial views into what's actually like partial views into what's actually being exploited by ransomware um and but being exploited by ransomware um and but being exploited by ransomware um and but not the entire view. So again if you not the entire view. So again if you not the entire view. So again if you have a KV list maybe you want to have a KV list maybe you want to have a KV list maybe you want to prioritize stuff that's used in prioritize stuff that's used in prioritize stuff that's used in ransomware maybe you want to prioritize ransomware maybe you want to prioritize ransomware maybe you want to prioritize stuff that's used by APS all these stuff that's used by APS all these stuff that's used by APS all these things give con uh context to what that things give con uh context to what that things give con uh context to what that risk is. Um, another thing is we can risk is. Um, another thing is we can risk is. Um, another thing is we can talk about organization size and how talk about organization size and how talk about organization size and how that scales with those types of kind of that scales with those types of kind of that scales with those types of kind of CVE consequences we see. So what I've CVE consequences we see. So what I've CVE consequences we see. So what I've done here is I've taken the number of done here is I've taken the number of done here is I've taken the number of employees in an organization and bend it employees in an organization and bend it employees in an organization and bend it up uh into a log scale here. And we up uh into a log scale here. And we up uh into a log scale here. And we looked at their footprint and the looked at their footprint and the looked at their footprint and the likelihood that they have uh a CVE likelihood that they have uh a CVE likelihood that they have uh a CVE that's exploited in the wild that's like that's exploited in the wild that's like that's exploited in the wild that's like hits one of those kev lists. uh a hits one of those kev lists. uh a hits one of those kev lists. uh a percent of orgs that have a CDE that's percent of orgs that have a CDE that's percent of orgs that have a CDE that's been used in ransomware and one that has been used in ransomware and one that has been used in ransomware and one that has an AP exploit and they kind of go down an AP exploit and they kind of go down an AP exploit and they kind of go down in uh severity here. But I think there's in uh severity here. But I think there's in uh severity here. But I think there's a couple interesting things. One is that a couple interesting things. One is that a couple interesting things. One is that as your footprint increases, as you have as your footprint increases, as you have as your footprint increases, as you have more and more um employees, your more and more um employees, your more and more um employees, your likelihood goes up to, you know, 70%. If likelihood goes up to, you know, 70%. If likelihood goes up to, you know, 70%. If you're a large company, you have these you're a large company, you have these you're a large company, you have these things exposed most likely. Um but the things exposed most likely. Um but the things exposed most likely. Um but the other thing that's interesting is as we other thing that's interesting is as we other thing that's interesting is as we go down, it never quite gets to zero. So go down, it never quite gets to zero. So go down, it never quite gets to zero. So even those small companies with even those small companies with even those small companies with incredibly small footprints, maybe they incredibly small footprints, maybe they incredibly small footprints, maybe they only have one or two assets out there, a only have one or two assets out there, a only have one or two assets out there, a decent percentage of them still have decent percentage of them still have decent percentage of them still have this exposure that we can detect. Um, this exposure that we can detect. Um, this exposure that we can detect. Um, and I just think that that this is like and I just think that that this is like and I just think that that this is like a fascinating uh measure of like how a fascinating uh measure of like how a fascinating uh measure of like how footprint affects the the total um uh footprint affects the the total um uh footprint affects the the total um uh risk that an organization's facing. So risk that an organization's facing. So risk that an organization's facing. So with that, I'm going to hand it off to with that, I'm going to hand it off to with that, I'm going to hand it off to Sander to move from organizational risk Sander to move from organizational risk Sander to move from organizational risk to systemic risk. to systemic risk. to systemic risk. So um as we have told you guys already So um as we have told you guys already So um as we have told you guys already uh we we want to get a sense of how can uh we we want to get a sense of how can uh we we want to get a sense of how can we measure phenomena that are outside of we measure phenomena that are outside of we measure phenomena that are outside of the control of an organization that the control of an organization that the control of an organization that still will inflect the risk and the risk still will inflect the risk and the risk still will inflect the risk and the risk management of vulnerabilities within management of vulnerabilities within management of vulnerabilities within that organization. Right? Uh so the the that organization. Right? Uh so the the that organization. Right? Uh so the the first thing that we wanted to get a first thing that we wanted to get a first thing that we wanted to get a sense of is how do CVEes distribute sense of is how do CVEes distribute sense of is how do CVEes distribute across the software in which they across the software in which they across the software in which they reside. Right? So another obvious reside. Right? So another obvious reside. Right? So another obvious statement one vulnerability gets copied statement one vulnerability gets copied statement one vulnerability gets copied to many pieces of software. Uh so what to many pieces of software. Uh so what to many pieces of software. Uh so what we wanted to do oh my god these exports we wanted to do oh my god these exports we wanted to do oh my god these exports uh we wanted to get a relationship uh we wanted to get a relationship uh we wanted to get a relationship between pearls or package urls and and between pearls or package urls and and between pearls or package urls and and how many pearls a CV shows up in and its how many pearls a CV shows up in and its how many pearls a CV shows up in and its relationship to both discoverability in relationship to both discoverability in relationship to both discoverability in terms of CV detections and also terms of CV detections and also terms of CV detections and also exploitation activity. Brief aside how exploitation activity. Brief aside how exploitation activity. Brief aside how do package URLs work? Again I think do package URLs work? Again I think do package URLs work? Again I think there there have been like five talks on there there have been like five talks on there there have been like five talks on Pearl so far. Uh so I'm not going to Pearl so far. Uh so I'm not going to Pearl so far. Uh so I'm not going to spend too much time on this is broadly spend too much time on this is broadly spend too much time on this is broadly analogous to common product enumeration analogous to common product enumeration analogous to common product enumeration or CPE. It is an attempt to standardize or CPE. It is an attempt to standardize or CPE. It is an attempt to standardize the identification and location of the identification and location of the identification and location of software packages. Very briefly, it's software packages. Very briefly, it's software packages. Very briefly, it's important to know that the required important to know that the required important to know that the required elements in a pearl are the scheme type elements in a pearl are the scheme type elements in a pearl are the scheme type and name. And then optional are and name. And then optional are and name. And then optional are namespace, version, qualifiers, and namespace, version, qualifiers, and namespace, version, qualifiers, and subpath. A couple examples there just to subpath. A couple examples there just to subpath. A couple examples there just to give you a sense of kind of what these give you a sense of kind of what these give you a sense of kind of what these things look like. Uh and then just things look like. Uh and then just things look like. Uh and then just briefly to note that the relationship of briefly to note that the relationship of briefly to note that the relationship of CVEes to pearls is many to many most of CVEes to pearls is many to many most of CVEes to pearls is many to many most of the time. uh in the sense that one CVE the time. uh in the sense that one CVE the time. uh in the sense that one CVE is likely to show up in multiple pearls is likely to show up in multiple pearls is likely to show up in multiple pearls just essentially by the time you've just essentially by the time you've just essentially by the time you've versioned your software into two versioned your software into two versioned your software into two different versions you've probably got different versions you've probably got different versions you've probably got two pearls associated with the CVE two pearls associated with the CVE two pearls associated with the CVE assuming the CV is in there uh but also assuming the CV is in there uh but also assuming the CV is in there uh but also in the reverse right so so a pearl a in the reverse right so so a pearl a in the reverse right so so a pearl a package a piece of software is likely to package a piece of software is likely to package a piece of software is likely to contain multiple CVEes within it uh so contain multiple CVEes within it uh so contain multiple CVEes within it uh so to give you a sense of kind of how CVEes to give you a sense of kind of how CVEes to give you a sense of kind of how CVEes distribute among pearls um what you see distribute among pearls um what you see distribute among pearls um what you see here is a sort of a selection of the here is a sort of a selection of the here is a sort of a selection of the pearls within our data. The way that we pearls within our data. The way that we pearls within our data. The way that we selected this actually was we took the selected this actually was we took the selected this actually was we took the the um for every unique name name space the um for every unique name name space the um for every unique name name space and no it was type and namespace. Yeah, and no it was type and namespace. Yeah, and no it was type and namespace. Yeah, we took the the pearl with the largest we took the the pearl with the largest we took the the pearl with the largest right. So so kind of that within each right. So so kind of that within each right. So so kind of that within each node in this hierarchy of software we node in this hierarchy of software we node in this hierarchy of software we took the the um the pearl with the took the the um the pearl with the took the the um the pearl with the largest number of CVEes. So what you see largest number of CVEes. So what you see largest number of CVEes. So what you see here at the top for instance Debian hope here at the top for instance Debian hope here at the top for instance Debian hope you guys can read that uh Debian has you guys can read that uh Debian has you guys can read that uh Debian has 6,200 CVS associated with it whereas 6,200 CVS associated with it whereas 6,200 CVS associated with it whereas down at the bottom the npm package down at the bottom the npm package down at the bottom the npm package electron which is the one with the electron which is the one with the electron which is the one with the largest number of CVS only has 27. So largest number of CVS only has 27. So largest number of CVS only has 27. So the real point here is very very large the real point here is very very large the real point here is very very large range in terms of the ratio of uh CVE to range in terms of the ratio of uh CVE to range in terms of the ratio of uh CVE to pearls. Now, if we invert that and we pearls. Now, if we invert that and we pearls. Now, if we invert that and we say uh ratio of pearls to CVEes on the say uh ratio of pearls to CVEes on the say uh ratio of pearls to CVEes on the left, what we're trying to do is is find left, what we're trying to do is is find left, what we're trying to do is is find out what is the relationship between how out what is the relationship between how out what is the relationship between how many packages a CVE shows up in in terms many packages a CVE shows up in in terms many packages a CVE shows up in in terms of that little vulnerable couple lines of that little vulnerable couple lines of that little vulnerable couple lines of code. What is the relationship of code. What is the relationship of code. What is the relationship between its distribution in unique between its distribution in unique between its distribution in unique packages and new CV detections per packages and new CV detections per packages and new CV detections per month? And what you see is generally month? And what you see is generally month? And what you see is generally speaking, they scale linearly, right? speaking, they scale linearly, right? speaking, they scale linearly, right? And so so as the number of affected And so so as the number of affected And so so as the number of affected pearls by a CV goes up, so does the pearls by a CV goes up, so does the pearls by a CV goes up, so does the likelihood of detecting that CV in the likelihood of detecting that CV in the likelihood of detecting that CV in the wild. Although we should also note that wild. Although we should also note that wild. Although we should also note that I think more notable than the than this I think more notable than the than this I think more notable than the than this trend is just the the deep deep cluster trend is just the the deep deep cluster trend is just the the deep deep cluster of CVEes down in the lower left meaning of CVEes down in the lower left meaning of CVEes down in the lower left meaning small number of pearls, small number of small number of pearls, small number of small number of pearls, small number of detections. Now on the other side on the detections. Now on the other side on the detections. Now on the other side on the exploitation uh there there are a couple exploitation uh there there are a couple exploitation uh there there are a couple of different kind of modes in this that of different kind of modes in this that of different kind of modes in this that I think tell some interesting stories. I I think tell some interesting stories. I I think tell some interesting stories. I think the the the biggest thing to think the the the biggest thing to think the the the biggest thing to emphasize here is that the the emphasize here is that the the emphasize here is that the the distribution along the y-axis of EPSS distribution along the y-axis of EPSS distribution along the y-axis of EPSS scores matches that original EPSS scores matches that original EPSS scores matches that original EPSS distribution that we showed you guys distribution that we showed you guys distribution that we showed you guys many slides ago. Um but in short, I many slides ago. Um but in short, I many slides ago. Um but in short, I would say this plot on the right tells would say this plot on the right tells would say this plot on the right tells us not a huge relationship between Pearl us not a huge relationship between Pearl us not a huge relationship between Pearl distribution or kind of a proliferation distribution or kind of a proliferation distribution or kind of a proliferation in multiple packages and exploitation in multiple packages and exploitation in multiple packages and exploitation likelihood. And the easiest way to see likelihood. And the easiest way to see likelihood. And the easiest way to see that is just that upper right is that is just that upper right is that is just that upper right is comparatively empty compared to the comparatively empty compared to the comparatively empty compared to the upper left and the lower left. upper left and the lower left. upper left and the lower left. Oh, that's so talking about the fact Oh, that's so talking about the fact Oh, that's so talking about the fact that CVES are sometimes present more in that CVES are sometimes present more in that CVES are sometimes present more in other kind of software distributions other kind of software distributions other kind of software distributions than others got us thinking about than others got us thinking about than others got us thinking about inequality in general and in particular inequality in general and in particular inequality in general and in particular we have this scanning data that tells us we have this scanning data that tells us we have this scanning data that tells us how uh vulnerabilities are distributed how uh vulnerabilities are distributed how uh vulnerabilities are distributed distributed across distributed across distributed across organizations and one thing that we organizations and one thing that we organizations and one thing that we wanted to examine was how unequally are wanted to examine was how unequally are wanted to examine was how unequally are CVEes spread across organizations. Now, CVEes spread across organizations. Now, CVEes spread across organizations. Now, thankfully, economists have been thankfully, economists have been thankfully, economists have been studying inequality for a long time, and studying inequality for a long time, and studying inequality for a long time, and there's this convenient measure called there's this convenient measure called there's this convenient measure called the Jenny coefficient that tells us how the Jenny coefficient that tells us how the Jenny coefficient that tells us how unequal things are. So, I'm going to unequal things are. So, I'm going to unequal things are. So, I'm going to tell you a little bit about the Jenny tell you a little bit about the Jenny tell you a little bit about the Jenny coefficient uh by giving an example here coefficient uh by giving an example here coefficient uh by giving an example here of how to calculate it. Uh so the way of how to calculate it. Uh so the way of how to calculate it. Uh so the way that it works is you take a resource uh that it works is you take a resource uh that it works is you take a resource uh you count how many of that resource each you count how many of that resource each you count how many of that resource each organization or person has. You order organization or person has. You order organization or person has. You order that list from highest to lowest and that list from highest to lowest and that list from highest to lowest and then you kind of make this plot and you then you kind of make this plot and you then you kind of make this plot and you start down here in the lower left and start down here in the lower left and start down here in the lower left and you say the percent of organizations or you say the percent of organizations or you say the percent of organizations or individuals goes across this way and the individuals goes across this way and the individuals goes across this way and the percent of all the detections we have percent of all the detections we have percent of all the detections we have goes up this way. And so if we look at goes up this way. And so if we look at goes up this way. And so if we look at this 2022 CVE, what we find is that um this 2022 CVE, what we find is that um this 2022 CVE, what we find is that um there is about three organizations that there is about three organizations that there is about three organizations that account for 80% of the detections that account for 80% of the detections that account for 80% of the detections that we find of that CVE. This is a graphana we find of that CVE. This is a graphana we find of that CVE. This is a graphana CVE, a cross-sight request forgery CVE, a cross-sight request forgery CVE, a cross-sight request forgery vulnerability. Um and what this is is vulnerability. Um and what this is is vulnerability. Um and what this is is these are cloud providers who are these are cloud providers who are these are cloud providers who are providing Graphana and their uh image providing Graphana and their uh image providing Graphana and their uh image that they're providing is vulnerable. that they're providing is vulnerable. that they're providing is vulnerable. And so if that organization were to fix And so if that organization were to fix And so if that organization were to fix their Graphana instance or their their Graphana instance or their their Graphana instance or their Graphana image that they're allowing to Graphana image that they're allowing to Graphana image that they're allowing to put out um that would mean they would put out um that would mean they would put out um that would mean they would fix 80% of the vaults. We'd have a lot fix 80% of the vaults. We'd have a lot fix 80% of the vaults. We'd have a lot less dissections. Now compare that to less dissections. Now compare that to less dissections. Now compare that to something like this Exchange something like this Exchange something like this Exchange vulnerability um where it's just about vulnerability um where it's just about vulnerability um where it's just about even. So if you run Microsoft Exchange even. So if you run Microsoft Exchange even. So if you run Microsoft Exchange on prem, you probably only have one of on prem, you probably only have one of on prem, you probably only have one of them, right? Uh so it's going to be them, right? Uh so it's going to be them, right? Uh so it's going to be evenly distributed across all evenly distributed across all evenly distributed across all organizations and we have a low jinny organizations and we have a low jinny organizations and we have a low jinny coefficient. So let's look at the coefficient. So let's look at the coefficient. So let's look at the distribution of that jinny coefficient. distribution of that jinny coefficient. distribution of that jinny coefficient. across or across all the CDs that we across or across all the CDs that we across or across all the CDs that we have. The interesting thing here is we have. The interesting thing here is we have. The interesting thing here is we have two modes. We have one around.3 and have two modes. We have one around.3 and have two modes. We have one around.3 and one around 7. So these are the ones one around 7. So these are the ones one around 7. So these are the ones the.3 ones are the ones that are spread the.3 ones are the ones that are spread the.3 ones are the ones that are spread out very evenly or relatively evenly out very evenly or relatively evenly out very evenly or relatively evenly while the seven ones are the ones that while the seven ones are the ones that while the seven ones are the ones that are really concentrated within a single are really concentrated within a single are really concentrated within a single organization. Now this has like these organization. Now this has like these organization. Now this has like these are not good or bad. There's different are not good or bad. There's different are not good or bad. There's different consequences. On one hand, low genie consequences. On one hand, low genie consequences. On one hand, low genie vulnerabilities, this is going to take vulnerabilities, this is going to take vulnerabilities, this is going to take potentially longer to fix. And we're potentially longer to fix. And we're potentially longer to fix. And we're going to actually look at that in a going to actually look at that in a going to actually look at that in a second. Uh because each individual org second. Uh because each individual org second. Uh because each individual org has to act individually to do the has to act individually to do the has to act individually to do the remediation where the high gen remediation where the high gen remediation where the high gen coefficient ones, one org can have a coefficient ones, one org can have a coefficient ones, one org can have a huge effect, right? So they can fix a huge effect, right? So they can fix a huge effect, right? So they can fix a lot of things fast if they update lot of things fast if they update lot of things fast if they update software or distribution. Um this is software or distribution. Um this is software or distribution. Um this is also but kind of relatively bad for the also but kind of relatively bad for the also but kind of relatively bad for the organization holding those. So, uh, if organization holding those. So, uh, if organization holding those. So, uh, if an attacker is looking to exploit that an attacker is looking to exploit that an attacker is looking to exploit that graphana vulnerability, there's like a graphana vulnerability, there's like a graphana vulnerability, there's like a 90% chance they're going to land on one 90% chance they're going to land on one 90% chance they're going to land on one of three or four organizations, right? of three or four organizations, right? of three or four organizations, right? So, if you're the one holding all the So, if you're the one holding all the So, if you're the one holding all the raffle tickets, the exploitation raffle raffle tickets, the exploitation raffle raffle tickets, the exploitation raffle tickets, um, you're the one whose tickets, um, you're the one whose tickets, um, you're the one whose tickets going to get punched when when tickets going to get punched when when tickets going to get punched when when an attacker goes for it. So, if you have an attacker goes for it. So, if you have an attacker goes for it. So, if you have the high concentration of the high concentration of the high concentration of vulnerabilities, you're more likely to vulnerabilities, you're more likely to vulnerabilities, you're more likely to get exploited than if it's really get exploited than if it's really get exploited than if it's really diverse and really spread diverse and really spread diverse and really spread out. Um, so in fact, we can test that. out. Um, so in fact, we can test that. out. Um, so in fact, we can test that. Um what we see here is the genie Um what we see here is the genie Um what we see here is the genie coefficient across the horizontal versus coefficient across the horizontal versus coefficient across the horizontal versus that median survival time that I showed that median survival time that I showed that median survival time that I showed earlier and the low gen coefficient earlier and the low gen coefficient earlier and the low gen coefficient vulnerabilities take around 50 days to vulnerabilities take around 50 days to vulnerabilities take around 50 days to fix. So these are the ones that are fix. So these are the ones that are fix. So these are the ones that are really diffuse and and spread out really diffuse and and spread out really diffuse and and spread out whereas the high genie coefficient ones whereas the high genie coefficient ones whereas the high genie coefficient ones tend to get fixed faster about 25 days. tend to get fixed faster about 25 days. tend to get fixed faster about 25 days. So this isn't a huge difference but it So this isn't a huge difference but it So this isn't a huge difference but it does seem to indicate that when there's does seem to indicate that when there's does seem to indicate that when there's a high concentration things get fixed a high concentration things get fixed a high concentration things get fixed fixed faster likely because there is fixed faster likely because there is fixed faster likely because there is this ability to do a bunch of fixes at this ability to do a bunch of fixes at this ability to do a bunch of fixes at one time. There is a ton of variation one time. There is a ton of variation one time. There is a ton of variation though here. Um it's a little bit hard though here. Um it's a little bit hard though here. Um it's a little bit hard to see on this plot because the the to see on this plot because the the to see on this plot because the the yellow, but there are vulnerabilities yellow, but there are vulnerabilities yellow, but there are vulnerabilities that are way up here. They're highly that are way up here. They're highly that are way up here. They're highly concentrated u but they uh do not uh get concentrated u but they uh do not uh get concentrated u but they uh do not uh get fixed very quickly. So there are these fixed very quickly. So there are these fixed very quickly. So there are these images that get pushed out to cloud uh images that get pushed out to cloud uh images that get pushed out to cloud uh distributions that have high uh um have distributions that have high uh um have distributions that have high uh um have really long remediation really long remediation really long remediation times. Um so I wanted to look at this times. Um so I wanted to look at this times. Um so I wanted to look at this based on uh kind of our detections per based on uh kind of our detections per based on uh kind of our detections per month and there's a lot less correlation month and there's a lot less correlation month and there's a lot less correlation here. Uh this is the genie coefficient here. Uh this is the genie coefficient here. Uh this is the genie coefficient across that uh detections per month. Um across that uh detections per month. Um across that uh detections per month. Um so some CDEs with really high jinny so some CDEs with really high jinny so some CDEs with really high jinny coefficients um are also like hugely coefficients um are also like hugely coefficients um are also like hugely detected. In fact, here's our jQuery detected. In fact, here's our jQuery detected. In fact, here's our jQuery one. This one way up in the right one. This one way up in the right one. This one way up in the right corner. Um these all exist on corner. Um these all exist on corner. Um these all exist on essentially one provider. I'm not going essentially one provider. I'm not going essentially one provider. I'm not going to tell you who that provider is, but to tell you who that provider is, but to tell you who that provider is, but they allow users to put out their own they allow users to put out their own they allow users to put out their own web page. Think Geio Cities, but it's web page. Think Geio Cities, but it's web page. Think Geio Cities, but it's not Geio Cities. Um and essentially this not Geio Cities. Um and essentially this not Geio Cities. Um and essentially this has a jQuery vulnerability. They're has a jQuery vulnerability. They're has a jQuery vulnerability. They're using a bad version of jQuery. And so we using a bad version of jQuery. And so we using a bad version of jQuery. And so we detect it all the time. So if that detect it all the time. So if that detect it all the time. So if that organization updates the jQuery that organization updates the jQuery that organization updates the jQuery that they uh distribute with their web pages, they uh distribute with their web pages, they uh distribute with their web pages, then these would all go away for the then these would all go away for the then these would all go away for the most part. Um and so that we could see most part. Um and so that we could see most part. Um and so that we could see the kind of spread here. The next thing the kind of spread here. The next thing the kind of spread here. The next thing I wanted to look at is like are I wanted to look at is like are I wanted to look at is like are attackers targeting or is there attackers targeting or is there attackers targeting or is there exploitation uh likelihood for for some exploitation uh likelihood for for some exploitation uh likelihood for for some of these vulnerabilities? And the answer of these vulnerabilities? And the answer of these vulnerabilities? And the answer is actually not really. Um so this is is actually not really. Um so this is is actually not really. Um so this is the EPSS score. That's that same plot. the EPSS score. That's that same plot. the EPSS score. That's that same plot. Now we've just colored everything by Now we've just colored everything by Now we've just colored everything by EPSS score. Uh, interestingly enough, EPSS score. Uh, interestingly enough, EPSS score. Uh, interestingly enough, this is the only chart I've ever made this is the only chart I've ever made this is the only chart I've ever made where EPSS is on a linear scale and that where EPSS is on a linear scale and that where EPSS is on a linear scale and that makes sense. Um, usually I have to log makes sense. Um, usually I have to log makes sense. Um, usually I have to log scale that. Um, so up here is a really scale that. Um, so up here is a really scale that. Um, so up here is a really high probability of exploitation, really high probability of exploitation, really high probability of exploitation, really high jinny coefficient. It's high jinny coefficient. It's high jinny coefficient. It's concentrated in one thing and we see it concentrated in one thing and we see it concentrated in one thing and we see it a lot. It's poodle. Uh, this is the a lot. It's poodle. Uh, this is the a lot. It's poodle. Uh, this is the thing that comes up all the time. This thing that comes up all the time. This thing that comes up all the time. This is the this is like a legacy is the this is like a legacy is the this is like a legacy vulnerability. I don't know what if vulnerability. I don't know what if vulnerability. I don't know what if we're ever going to be free of it. Um, we're ever going to be free of it. Um, we're ever going to be free of it. Um, but there are some other ones. Uh, so but there are some other ones. Uh, so but there are some other ones. Uh, so some Apache vulnerabilities that are some Apache vulnerabilities that are some Apache vulnerabilities that are kind of different. high Jenny kind of different. high Jenny kind of different. high Jenny coefficients. They're really coefficients. They're really coefficients. They're really concentrated. Uh but and really high concentrated. Uh but and really high concentrated. Uh but and really high detection rates. Um this one is a detection rates. Um this one is a detection rates. Um this one is a serverside request forgery. Really high serverside request forgery. Really high serverside request forgery. Really high likelihood of exploitation. We saw a lot likelihood of exploitation. We saw a lot likelihood of exploitation. We saw a lot of activity for it. Um this one which is of activity for it. Um this one which is of activity for it. Um this one which is an IP off bypass which means you can get an IP off bypass which means you can get an IP off bypass which means you can get around like IP filters for that Apache around like IP filters for that Apache around like IP filters for that Apache uh vulnerability, low likelihood of uh vulnerability, low likelihood of uh vulnerability, low likelihood of exploitation. So even though they're exploitation. So even though they're exploitation. So even though they're very similar vulnerabilities except in very similar vulnerabilities except in very similar vulnerabilities except in their type, they affect roughly the same their type, they affect roughly the same their type, they affect roughly the same software. Um they're really software. Um they're really software. Um they're really concentrated. We detect them a lot. the concentrated. We detect them a lot. the concentrated. We detect them a lot. the exploitation rates are different. Um, on exploitation rates are different. Um, on exploitation rates are different. Um, on kind of the other end of this where we kind of the other end of this where we kind of the other end of this where we see those low gen coefficients, um, see those low gen coefficients, um, see those low gen coefficients, um, there's two PHP vms which are there's two PHP vms which are there's two PHP vms which are interesting. My arrow doesn't go quite interesting. My arrow doesn't go quite interesting. My arrow doesn't go quite go to the right place, but there's a red go to the right place, but there's a red go to the right place, but there's a red one up here which is a use after free. one up here which is a use after free. one up here which is a use after free. We detect it a lot. It's really diffuse We detect it a lot. It's really diffuse We detect it a lot. It's really diffuse and uh, attackers are going after it. and uh, attackers are going after it. and uh, attackers are going after it. Uh, similarly, we detect this other uh, Uh, similarly, we detect this other uh, Uh, similarly, we detect this other uh, more recent CVE. We detect it a lot. more recent CVE. We detect it a lot. more recent CVE. We detect it a lot. It's really diffuse, but attackers It's really diffuse, but attackers It's really diffuse, but attackers aren't going for it. So these are really aren't going for it. So these are really aren't going for it. So these are really different measures of systemic risk for different measures of systemic risk for different measures of systemic risk for these these two different these these two different these these two different vulnerabilities on the same vulnerabilities on the same vulnerabilities on the same software. Um what time is it? Okay, 10 software. Um what time is it? Okay, 10 software. Um what time is it? Okay, 10 minutes. Um about um we're gonna I'm minutes. Um about um we're gonna I'm minutes. Um about um we're gonna I'm going to do one thing really briefly going to do one thing really briefly going to do one thing really briefly largely because I promised it in the largely because I promised it in the largely because I promised it in the abstract and also because I think it's abstract and also because I think it's abstract and also because I think it's really interesting. Um we recently wrote really interesting. Um we recently wrote really interesting. Um we recently wrote a white paper about supply chain risk. a white paper about supply chain risk. a white paper about supply chain risk. Um and this is the last last chart that Um and this is the last last chart that Um and this is the last last chart that I put together in a 20page uh report. I put together in a 20page uh report. I put together in a 20page uh report. There's a lot of context going into There's a lot of context going into There's a lot of context going into this, but I I think it illustrates one this, but I I think it illustrates one this, but I I think it illustrates one point. Um, on the horizontal axis, we point. Um, on the horizontal axis, we point. Um, on the horizontal axis, we have the market share of approximately have the market share of approximately have the market share of approximately 5,000 different providers. They provide 5,000 different providers. They provide 5,000 different providers. They provide software services, sometimes physical software services, sometimes physical software services, sometimes physical services to organizations. Uh, the services to organizations. Uh, the services to organizations. Uh, the market share is their like input into market share is their like input into market share is their like input into the global economy, right? It's the it's the global economy, right? It's the it's the global economy, right? It's the it's the percent of customers based on the percent of customers based on the percent of customers based on revenue who use that particular revenue who use that particular revenue who use that particular supplier. on the horizontal axis is the supplier. on the horizontal axis is the supplier. on the horizontal axis is the kind of detections for that kind of detections for that kind of detections for that organization, the number of CDEs we see organization, the number of CDEs we see organization, the number of CDEs we see per year and we've actually normalized per year and we've actually normalized per year and we've actually normalized it here by asset. The size is the number it here by asset. The size is the number it here by asset. The size is the number of assets they have, kind of a measure of assets they have, kind of a measure of assets they have, kind of a measure of the footprint and the color is how of the footprint and the color is how of the footprint and the color is how fast they fix things. Um, I don't want fast they fix things. Um, I don't want fast they fix things. Um, I don't want to say too much about this other than we to say too much about this other than we to say too much about this other than we have suppliers that serve more than 10% have suppliers that serve more than 10% have suppliers that serve more than 10% of the global economy uh that are taking of the global economy uh that are taking of the global economy uh that are taking more than 200 days to fix things. They more than 200 days to fix things. They more than 200 days to fix things. They have a huge number. we're we're have a huge number. we're we're have a huge number. we're we're detecting vulnerabilities on essentially detecting vulnerabilities on essentially detecting vulnerabilities on essentially 1% of their assets per year. Um, and 1% of their assets per year. Um, and 1% of their assets per year. Um, and they have a really big footprint. They they have a really big footprint. They they have a really big footprint. They have a lot of assets to to attack. Um, have a lot of assets to to attack. Um, have a lot of assets to to attack. Um, and this is not to shame those and this is not to shame those and this is not to shame those companies, but just to give light to the companies, but just to give light to the companies, but just to give light to the fact that there is this systemic risk fact that there is this systemic risk fact that there is this systemic risk based on vulnerabilities. And moreover, based on vulnerabilities. And moreover, based on vulnerabilities. And moreover, if you are a large provider, um, and you if you are a large provider, um, and you if you are a large provider, um, and you are over here, you want to make sure are over here, you want to make sure are over here, you want to make sure that you are down in this corner. You that you are down in this corner. You that you are down in this corner. You want to be like this blue dot or this want to be like this blue dot or this want to be like this blue dot or this green dot where you're fixing things green dot where you're fixing things green dot where you're fixing things fast and we don't have a lot of fast and we don't have a lot of fast and we don't have a lot of detections because if you're a major detections because if you're a major detections because if you're a major supplier and you have an incident, um supplier and you have an incident, um supplier and you have an incident, um there's going to be a lot of downstream there's going to be a lot of downstream there's going to be a lot of downstream risk to you. Not just as a uh not just risk to you. Not just as a uh not just risk to you. Not just as a uh not just personal organization, but you through personal organization, but you through personal organization, but you through your supply chain, people are going to your supply chain, people are going to your supply chain, people are going to be mad at you when you go down. Um look be mad at you when you go down. Um look be mad at you when you go down. Um look what happened to CrowdStrike this what happened to CrowdStrike this what happened to CrowdStrike this summer. There were a lot of people that summer. There were a lot of people that summer. There were a lot of people that were mad at them. Um so with that, I'm were mad at them. Um so with that, I'm were mad at them. Um so with that, I'm going to hand it over to Sander to bring going to hand it over to Sander to bring going to hand it over to Sander to bring us us us home. All right. Uh so now what right uh home. All right. Uh so now what right uh home. All right. Uh so now what right uh I want to come back to this concept that I want to come back to this concept that I want to come back to this concept that we were just talking about about context we were just talking about about context we were just talking about about context for vulnerability risk right um so we for vulnerability risk right um so we for vulnerability risk right um so we would argue that the existing measures would argue that the existing measures would argue that the existing measures such as CVSS such as EPSS Kevl etc they such as CVSS such as EPSS Kevl etc they such as CVSS such as EPSS Kevl etc they provide some of that context at scale provide some of that context at scale provide some of that context at scale but any of these measurements when but any of these measurements when but any of these measurements when viewed in a vacuum can mislead you can viewed in a vacuum can mislead you can viewed in a vacuum can mislead you can cause you to misprioritize cause you to misprioritize cause you to misprioritize vulnerabilities right to put a finer vulnerabilities right to put a finer vulnerabilities right to put a finer point on that when we talk about risk point on that when we talk about risk point on that when we talk about risk we're talking about probability ility we're talking about probability ility we're talking about probability ility and loss, right? The probability in of and loss, right? The probability in of and loss, right? The probability in of vulnerability risk should not just be vulnerability risk should not just be vulnerability risk should not just be reduced to the probability of reduced to the probability of reduced to the probability of exploitation, right? There are other exploitation, right? There are other exploitation, right? There are other questions here. Is it discoverable by questions here. Is it discoverable by questions here. Is it discoverable by attackers? Can it be reliably exploited? attackers? Can it be reliably exploited? attackers? Can it be reliably exploited? Will it be exploited before you're Will it be exploited before you're Will it be exploited before you're actually able to fix it? Low probability actually able to fix it? Low probability actually able to fix it? Low probability vulnerabilities do not necessarily mean vulnerabilities do not necessarily mean vulnerabilities do not necessarily mean low risk, right? This is that whole sort low risk, right? This is that whole sort low risk, right? This is that whole sort of um the the risk matrix from the early of um the the risk matrix from the early of um the the risk matrix from the early days of of risk management. So high days of of risk management. So high days of of risk management. So high attacker sophistication can make a low attacker sophistication can make a low attacker sophistication can make a low likelihood vulnerability into a very likelihood vulnerability into a very likelihood vulnerability into a very very big problem for your organization. very big problem for your organization. very big problem for your organization. Uh and their consequences of uh Uh and their consequences of uh Uh and their consequences of uh exploitation such as ransomware that can exploitation such as ransomware that can exploitation such as ransomware that can sort of outweigh the low probability of sort of outweigh the low probability of sort of outweigh the low probability of an explo exploitation event. Sounds an explo exploitation event. Sounds an explo exploitation event. Sounds pretty obvious, right? But really what pretty obvious, right? But really what pretty obvious, right? But really what we're trying to say is these are not we're trying to say is these are not we're trying to say is these are not just worth stating as statements on a just worth stating as statements on a just worth stating as statements on a slide, but worth trying to measure. slide, but worth trying to measure. slide, but worth trying to measure. Um, we've hopefully kind of shown you or Um, we've hopefully kind of shown you or Um, we've hopefully kind of shown you or or given you guys evidence that there is or given you guys evidence that there is or given you guys evidence that there is more to the risk at your organization more to the risk at your organization more to the risk at your organization than the vulnerabilities within your than the vulnerabilities within your than the vulnerabilities within your organization and that we should all be organization and that we should all be organization and that we should all be sort of broadening our gaze and trying sort of broadening our gaze and trying sort of broadening our gaze and trying to assess more about the global to assess more about the global to assess more about the global footprint of the vulnerabilities that footprint of the vulnerabilities that footprint of the vulnerabilities that apply to us. Okay. So, let's try to make apply to us. Okay. So, let's try to make apply to us. Okay. So, let's try to make this practical, give you guys something this practical, give you guys something this practical, give you guys something actually to take home. uh I would say actually to take home. uh I would say actually to take home. uh I would say for number one all the frameworks that for number one all the frameworks that for number one all the frameworks that we talked about fair octave so on and so we talked about fair octave so on and so we talked about fair octave so on and so forth these things are good but only to forth these things are good but only to forth these things are good but only to the extent that we have good robust the extent that we have good robust the extent that we have good robust measurements to feed into them they measurements to feed into them they measurements to feed into them they require us to bring our own data right require us to bring our own data right require us to bring our own data right and how do we get that right so I I and how do we get that right so I I and how do we get that right so I I think I mean I it's almost a cliche for think I mean I it's almost a cliche for think I mean I it's almost a cliche for a security person to stand up and say we a security person to stand up and say we a security person to stand up and say we should all share data more right but should all share data more right but should all share data more right but that's what I'm going to do uh we're not that's what I'm going to do uh we're not that's what I'm going to do uh we're not the worst at it right we have EPSS we the worst at it right we have EPSS we the worst at it right we have EPSS we have the siz kev um I also want to have the siz kev um I also want to have the siz kev um I also want to mention Groma explorer so our own Groma mention Groma explorer so our own Groma mention Groma explorer so our own Groma internet scam panner I just talked internet scam panner I just talked internet scam panner I just talked about. We do have a site out there about. We do have a site out there about. We do have a site out there called Chroma Explorer which is sort of called Chroma Explorer which is sort of called Chroma Explorer which is sort of like our own mini showdown. So you can like our own mini showdown. So you can like our own mini showdown. So you can go to Chroma Explorer, you can type in a go to Chroma Explorer, you can type in a go to Chroma Explorer, you can type in a CPE or a CVE. You can see how many of CPE or a CVE. You can see how many of CPE or a CVE. You can see how many of those instances we're actually detecting those instances we're actually detecting those instances we're actually detecting at any given time based on our most at any given time based on our most at any given time based on our most recent scan of most of the internet. Um recent scan of most of the internet. Um recent scan of most of the internet. Um but there's also other things. There's but there's also other things. There's but there's also other things. There's obviously Showdown itself. There's obviously Showdown itself. There's obviously Showdown itself. There's Shadow Server. The CVE um kind of system Shadow Server. The CVE um kind of system Shadow Server. The CVE um kind of system is also a rich source of of information is also a rich source of of information is also a rich source of of information about these sorts of things. One thing about these sorts of things. One thing about these sorts of things. One thing that has really really kind of been that has really really kind of been that has really really kind of been driven home to us over and over through driven home to us over and over through driven home to us over and over through this project is the importance of this project is the importance of this project is the importance of avoiding what what Ben has called avoiding what what Ben has called avoiding what what Ben has called measurement zealatry, which really means measurement zealatry, which really means measurement zealatry, which really means do not become fixated on any one do not become fixated on any one do not become fixated on any one measurement. There is no one measurement measurement. There is no one measurement measurement. There is no one measurement about a CVE that's going to tell you about a CVE that's going to tell you about a CVE that's going to tell you everything about the risk. And that everything about the risk. And that everything about the risk. And that actually parallels something that Jay actually parallels something that Jay actually parallels something that Jay wrote when he published his exploits in wrote when he published his exploits in wrote when he published his exploits in the wild report maybe six months ago, a the wild report maybe six months ago, a the wild report maybe six months ago, a year ago. Um there is no one CVE year ago. Um there is no one CVE year ago. Um there is no one CVE parameter or even threat actor parameter or even threat actor parameter or even threat actor observation that is going to by itself observation that is going to by itself observation that is going to by itself tell you everything you need to know tell you everything you need to know tell you everything you need to know about a vault. So let's go back to this about a vault. So let's go back to this about a vault. So let's go back to this question about context. What does it question about context. What does it question about context. What does it take to get that context that we need to take to get that context that we need to take to get that context that we need to make good decisions about vans at scale? make good decisions about vans at scale? make good decisions about vans at scale? Well again it's about measurement. Can I Well again it's about measurement. Can I Well again it's about measurement. Can I measure it? Do I have the vone itself? measure it? Do I have the vone itself? measure it? Do I have the vone itself? How valuable are the assets that that How valuable are the assets that that How valuable are the assets that that van sits on? Is it actually going to be van sits on? Is it actually going to be van sits on? Is it actually going to be exploited? And what kind of thread actor exploited? And what kind of thread actor exploited? And what kind of thread actor is actually going to go after it? How is actually going to go after it? How is actually going to go after it? How fast can I reasonably patch this thing? fast can I reasonably patch this thing? fast can I reasonably patch this thing? Is it a firmware or is it just kind of a Is it a firmware or is it just kind of a Is it a firmware or is it just kind of a a pushed out to all users patch Tuesday a pushed out to all users patch Tuesday a pushed out to all users patch Tuesday kind of a thing? What risk does it pose kind of a thing? What risk does it pose kind of a thing? What risk does it pose to me? What risk do my vans pose to to me? What risk do my vans pose to to me? What risk do my vans pose to others? And then also flip that. What others? And then also flip that. What others? And then also flip that. What risk do other people's vans pose to us? risk do other people's vans pose to us? risk do other people's vans pose to us? Thanks very much. I think at this point, Thanks very much. I think at this point, Thanks very much. I think at this point, let's use the time that we got for let's use the time that we got for let's use the time that we got for questions. I hope this has been questions. I hope this has been questions. I hope this has been valuable. Thanks very much for listening. All right, any questions? I know Jay has a comment. Okay. Just outrage, general rage. Okay. Just outrage, general rage. Okay. Just outrage, general rage. Oh, slides. Yeah. Um, we would we would Oh, slides. Yeah. Um, we would we would Oh, slides. Yeah. Um, we would we would love to share the slides. We'd also love love to share the slides. We'd also love love to share the slides. We'd also love to share them once we get them looking to share them once we get them looking to share them once we get them looking better. So, um, yeah. How are we going better. So, um, yeah. How are we going better. So, um, yeah. How are we going to do that? I think they get posted on to do that? I think they get posted on to do that? I think they get posted on websites. Great. Yeah. So, we will we websites. Great. Yeah. So, we will we websites. Great. Yeah. So, we will we will clean up that crap deck and uh and will clean up that crap deck and uh and will clean up that crap deck and uh and make sure it's available to you guys. make sure it's available to you guys. make sure it's available to you guys. We're not we're not going to sort of We're not we're not going to sort of We're not we're not going to sort of hoard those plots. If you want to use hoard those plots. If you want to use hoard those plots. If you want to use them, um we'd we'd be overjoyed actually them, um we'd we'd be overjoyed actually them, um we'd we'd be overjoyed actually if you shared the deck with other if you shared the deck with other if you shared the deck with other people. Um so, a quick question. Um you people. Um so, a quick question. Um you people. Um so, a quick question. Um you mentioned that there are some uh mentioned that there are some uh mentioned that there are some uh vulnerabilities that are only present in vulnerabilities that are only present in vulnerabilities that are only present in like one organization, they keep like one organization, they keep like one organization, they keep u surfacing uh in your scans. um did you u surfacing uh in your scans. um did you u surfacing uh in your scans. um did you conduct the same analysis when trying to conduct the same analysis when trying to conduct the same analysis when trying to clean those kind of outliers clean those kind of outliers clean those kind of outliers uh out of the data and like let's say uh out of the data and like let's say uh out of the data and like let's say defining a range okay only if a CV is defining a range okay only if a CV is defining a range okay only if a CV is present in more than x% of organization present in more than x% of organization present in more than x% of organization we'll take that into account and doing we'll take that into account and doing we'll take that into account and doing the same analysis uh yeah so for the the gen coefficient uh yeah so for the the gen coefficient uh yeah so for the the gen coefficient stuff and the concentration we looked at stuff and the concentration we looked at stuff and the concentration we looked at CVEes that only occur in at least 100 CVEes that only occur in at least 100 CVEes that only occur in at least 100 organizations um because otherwise you organizations um because otherwise you organizations um because otherwise you get this thing where it's like Oh, it get this thing where it's like Oh, it get this thing where it's like Oh, it occurs in two and we only occurs twice occurs in two and we only occurs twice occurs in two and we only occurs twice and so it has a zero gen coefficient and so it has a zero gen coefficient and so it has a zero gen coefficient because it's equally or it occurs in one because it's equally or it occurs in one because it's equally or it occurs in one organization and so it has a one for a organization and so it has a one for a organization and so it has a one for a gen coefficient. So we did we did uh gen coefficient. So we did we did uh gen coefficient. So we did we did uh reduce that a little bit. So you're reduce that a little bit. So you're reduce that a little bit. So you're you're missing the low end. Uh but it's you're missing the low end. Uh but it's you're missing the low end. Uh but it's still like we have to do that to get a still like we have to do that to get a still like we have to do that to get a valid measure of inequality. Yeah. valid measure of inequality. Yeah. valid measure of inequality. Yeah. Gotcha. So uh great talk. I So uh great talk. I So uh great talk. I agree 100% with a vulnerability is a agree 100% with a vulnerability is a agree 100% with a vulnerability is a vulnerability until an it's an exposure vulnerability until an it's an exposure vulnerability until an it's an exposure and it can get exploited. So given that and it can get exploited. So given that and it can get exploited. So given that you work at Bidsite, are you taking all you work at Bidsite, are you taking all you work at Bidsite, are you taking all this greatness that you just covered and this greatness that you just covered and this greatness that you just covered and applying that to your algorithm and not applying that to your algorithm and not applying that to your algorithm and not giving Fs for Poodle vulnerabilities? giving Fs for Poodle vulnerabilities? giving Fs for Poodle vulnerabilities? Very sensitive topic. Yeah, that is a Very sensitive topic. Yeah, that is a Very sensitive topic. Yeah, that is a sensitive topic. Uh I I can utterly sensitive topic. Uh I I can utterly sensitive topic. Uh I I can utterly dodge this question and say that like dodge this question and say that like dodge this question and say that like I'm on the research side, so I get to I'm on the research side, so I get to I'm on the research side, so I get to deal with the actual data. Um, and I deal with the actual data. Um, and I deal with the actual data. Um, and I don't I'm sorry I don't create the don't I'm sorry I don't create the don't I'm sorry I don't create the ratings. Okay, I'll answer that. Okay. ratings. Okay, I'll answer that. Okay. ratings. Okay, I'll answer that. Okay. Uh, as a representative of the of the Uh, as a representative of the of the Uh, as a representative of the of the product side of Bitsite, um, yeah, I I product side of Bitsite, um, yeah, I I product side of Bitsite, um, yeah, I I totally 100% acknowledge that this is a totally 100% acknowledge that this is a totally 100% acknowledge that this is a problem in the rating and the discussion problem in the rating and the discussion problem in the rating and the discussion of how we modify the rating at Bitsite of how we modify the rating at Bitsite of how we modify the rating at Bitsite is is super complicated. It involves a is is super complicated. It involves a is is super complicated. It involves a lot of moving parts. I can tell you that lot of moving parts. I can tell you that lot of moving parts. I can tell you that that behind the scenes I and other that behind the scenes I and other that behind the scenes I and other researchers are trying to move the researchers are trying to move the researchers are trying to move the organization in a way that we feel is organization in a way that we feel is organization in a way that we feel is going to make sure that algorithm is going to make sure that algorithm is going to make sure that algorithm is more and more relevant over time, but more and more relevant over time, but more and more relevant over time, but it's a it's a bit of a slow ship to it's a it's a bit of a slow ship to it's a it's a bit of a slow ship to turn. So, I I totally hear you. We're turn. So, I I totally hear you. We're turn. So, I I totally hear you. We're working on it. I know it's not going as working on it. I know it's not going as working on it. I know it's not going as fast as anybody wants, but it is it like fast as anybody wants, but it is it like fast as anybody wants, but it is it like we know that this is a big problem and we know that this is a big problem and we know that this is a big problem and and we're not underelling it internally. and we're not underelling it internally. and we're not underelling it internally. I appreciate you uh manning up to that I appreciate you uh manning up to that I appreciate you uh manning up to that one because you know you say one thing one because you know you say one thing one because you know you say one thing here and then obviously we we we get the here and then obviously we we we get the here and then obviously we we we get the reports that say the complete opposite. reports that say the complete opposite. reports that say the complete opposite. Yeah, I I also see some of those Yeah, I I also see some of those Yeah, I I also see some of those customer escalations too. So I I see the customer escalations too. So I I see the customer escalations too. So I I see the full circle and I I it's something we're full circle and I I it's something we're full circle and I I it's something we're working on. All right, I think it's lunch time. Uh All right, I think it's lunch time. Uh All right, I think it's lunch time. Uh do we want to maybe have time for one do we want to maybe have time for one do we want to maybe have time for one more? Absolutely. If you had a Discord more? Absolutely. If you had a Discord more? Absolutely. If you had a Discord question or somebody in the audience. question or somebody in the audience. question or somebody in the audience. Sure. Sure. Sure. All right. The question is, how do you All right. The question is, how do you All right. The question is, how do you Oh, glasses. How do you factor in the Oh, glasses. How do you factor in the Oh, glasses. How do you factor in the thousands of vulnerabilities that are thousands of vulnerabilities that are thousands of vulnerabilities that are publicly disclosed every year that do publicly disclosed every year that do publicly disclosed every year that do not receive a CVE ID? No. Yeah. Um, so I think this is an No. Yeah. Um, so I think this is an No. Yeah. Um, so I think this is an interesting question and one that comes interesting question and one that comes interesting question and one that comes up a lot in the work. Um, we did some up a lot in the work. Um, we did some up a lot in the work. Um, we did some work last year, um, looking at kind of work last year, um, looking at kind of work last year, um, looking at kind of the CVE landscape and what gets covered the CVE landscape and what gets covered the CVE landscape and what gets covered in that. Um, I'm going to argue that, in that. Um, I'm going to argue that, in that. Um, I'm going to argue that, uh, and I'll make this controversial. uh, and I'll make this controversial. uh, and I'll make this controversial. I'll be willing to fight about this I'll be willing to fight about this I'll be willing to fight about this later. Um, that if it doesn't have a later. Um, that if it doesn't have a later. Um, that if it doesn't have a CVE, it is not as risky as then if it CVE, it is not as risky as then if it CVE, it is not as risky as then if it does because if it was risky, somebody does because if it was risky, somebody does because if it was risky, somebody would probably take the time to report would probably take the time to report would probably take the time to report it or do something with it to elevate it it or do something with it to elevate it it or do something with it to elevate it to the point where it get does get an to the point where it get does get an to the point where it get does get an ID. A CNA takes notice. um an attacker ID. A CNA takes notice. um an attacker ID. A CNA takes notice. um an attacker does something with it that requires does something with it that requires does something with it that requires people to take notice and it actually people to take notice and it actually people to take notice and it actually gets to be a CVE. Um the vulnerabilities gets to be a CVE. Um the vulnerabilities gets to be a CVE. Um the vulnerabilities that do not have CVEes um they may just that do not have CVEes um they may just that do not have CVEes um they may just get patched in the development cycle, get patched in the development cycle, get patched in the development cycle, right? They exist within the the closed right? They exist within the the closed right? They exist within the the closed development cycle and we never see them. development cycle and we never see them. development cycle and we never see them. They may get patched within that open They may get patched within that open They may get patched within that open source development cycle and it's never source development cycle and it's never source development cycle and it's never a major release. Um, so I I am dubious a major release. Um, so I I am dubious a major release. Um, so I I am dubious at the risk that I I would say that in at the risk that I I would say that in at the risk that I I would say that in general uh non CVE vulnerabilities pose general uh non CVE vulnerabilities pose general uh non CVE vulnerabilities pose a much lower risk than CVE a much lower risk than CVE a much lower risk than CVE vulnerabilities. And if you have vulnerabilities. And if you have vulnerabilities. And if you have examples of these things that are worse, examples of these things that are worse, examples of these things that are worse, please bring them to me. Tell me about a please bring them to me. Tell me about a please bring them to me. Tell me about a CVE that's being explo or tell me about CVE that's being explo or tell me about CVE that's being explo or tell me about a vulnerability that's being exploed in a vulnerability that's being exploed in a vulnerability that's being exploed in the wild on like widely spread software the wild on like widely spread software the wild on like widely spread software that doesn't have a CVE ID. Come talk to that doesn't have a CVE ID. Come talk to that doesn't have a CVE ID. Come talk to me about it and I'm you know why not? me about it and I'm you know why not? me about it and I'm you know why not? Sure. But I'm saying if it is, it's Sure. But I'm saying if it is, it's Sure. But I'm saying if it is, it's probably going to get a CVE sooner probably going to get a CVE sooner probably going to get a CVE sooner rather than later. I'm actually gonna rather than later. I'm actually gonna rather than later. I'm actually gonna also add to that. Um I I I think that also add to that. Um I I I think that also add to that. Um I I I think that there's a there's a subtext going on in there's a there's a subtext going on in there's a there's a subtext going on in this entire talk and in all the research this entire talk and in all the research this entire talk and in all the research I've ever done in security, most I've ever done in security, most I've ever done in security, most research, which is about the problem of research, which is about the problem of research, which is about the problem of visibility and detection, right? And uh visibility and detection, right? And uh visibility and detection, right? And uh there are a lot of very vocal or there there are a lot of very vocal or there there are a lot of very vocal or there are a lot of stridident voices about the are a lot of stridident voices about the are a lot of stridident voices about the limitations of the CB program and and limitations of the CB program and and limitations of the CB program and and how frustrating it is and and all that how frustrating it is and and all that how frustrating it is and and all that sort of stuff. Um, but sort of stuff. Um, but sort of stuff. Um, but ultimately what what the CVE is good at ultimately what what the CVE is good at ultimately what what the CVE is good at is making sure in the same respect like is making sure in the same respect like is making sure in the same respect like the MIT attack framework is is good at the MIT attack framework is is good at the MIT attack framework is is good at making sure that we're all talking about making sure that we're all talking about making sure that we're all talking about the same thing, right? And so we can the same thing, right? And so we can the same thing, right? And so we can only do this kind of measurement, we can only do this kind of measurement, we can only do this kind of measurement, we can only do this kind of analysis, provide only do this kind of analysis, provide only do this kind of analysis, provide that context to the extent that we have that context to the extent that we have that context to the extent that we have reliable visibility that I can say this reliable visibility that I can say this reliable visibility that I can say this thing that I observed in the wild is thing that I observed in the wild is thing that I observed in the wild is actually what I think it is. And so for actually what I think it is. And so for actually what I think it is. And so for all the flaws and the limitations of the all the flaws and the limitations of the all the flaws and the limitations of the CVE system, that is sort of a critical CVE system, that is sort of a critical CVE system, that is sort of a critical component of us being able to even component of us being able to even component of us being able to even discuss and measure these things and discuss and measure these things and discuss and measure these things and know that what I'm looking at is this know that what I'm looking at is this know that what I'm looking at is this specific CVE and not a very very slight specific CVE and not a very very slight specific CVE and not a very very slight variation within the same package. variation within the same package. variation within the same package. Right? So for all of its limitations and Right? So for all of its limitations and Right? So for all of its limitations and this was essentially the the the gist of this was essentially the the the gist of this was essentially the the the gist of our talk last year. Uh yes, CV is a mess our talk last year. Uh yes, CV is a mess our talk last year. Uh yes, CV is a mess and it's also a mess that we desperately and it's also a mess that we desperately and it's also a mess that we desperately need um in order to do this kind of need um in order to do this kind of need um in order to do this kind of research, in order to do the kind of research, in order to do the kind of research, in order to do the kind of risk assessments that we do. So, um, I risk assessments that we do. So, um, I risk assessments that we do. So, um, I understand why there are a lot of people understand why there are a lot of people understand why there are a lot of people kind of flying the flag for non-CV kind of flying the flag for non-CV kind of flying the flag for non-CV phones. I think that they're doing great phones. I think that they're doing great phones. I think that they're doing great work. They are adding a lot of that deep work. They are adding a lot of that deep work. They are adding a lot of that deep context that we need, but it makes it context that we need, but it makes it context that we need, but it makes it very hard to analyze and and kind of do very hard to analyze and and kind of do very hard to analyze and and kind of do that that that work. You Thank you.
