Kind: captions Language: en Uh, my name is Probe. I do security Uh, my name is Probe. I do security Uh, my name is Probe. I do security stuff on the internet. I work in an stuff on the internet. I work in an stuff on the internet. I work in an organization called the Open Source organization called the Open Source organization called the Open Source Security Foundation. We are a project of Security Foundation. We are a project of Security Foundation. We are a project of the Linux Foundation. I've been doing the Linux Foundation. I've been doing the Linux Foundation. I've been doing upstream open source vulnerability upstream open source vulnerability upstream open source vulnerability coordination for about 15 coordination for about 15 coordination for about 15 years. Everything I know about upstream years. Everything I know about upstream years. Everything I know about upstream open source security. My former open source security. My former open source security. My former mentor. Yeah. mentor. Yeah. mentor. Yeah. I am not a I am not a I am not a lawyer. I am absolutely none of your lawyer. I am absolutely none of your lawyer. I am absolutely none of your lawyers either. I am not giving you lawyers either. I am not giving you lawyers either. I am not giving you legal advice. CRA is a law. There are legal advice. CRA is a law. There are legal advice. CRA is a law. There are pretty hefty consequences. So after pretty hefty consequences. So after pretty hefty consequences. So after today, if you're inspired about what we today, if you're inspired about what we today, if you're inspired about what we talked about and what you learned about talked about and what you learned about talked about and what you learned about this new legislation, I encourage you to this new legislation, I encourage you to this new legislation, I encourage you to go talk to your lawyer to get your go talk to your lawyer to get your go talk to your lawyer to get your organization's take on what your organization's take on what your organization's take on what your obligations or what you'll need to do to obligations or what you'll need to do to obligations or what you'll need to do to fulfill your fulfill your fulfill your obligations. So um this is all based on obligations. So um this is all based on obligations. So um this is all based on my earlier years of my earlier years of my earlier years of experience doing cyber security and experience doing cyber security and experience doing cyber security and upstream open source security. These are upstream open source security. These are upstream open source security. These are all my opinions. And when is Oh, it's a all my opinions. And when is Oh, it's a all my opinions. And when is Oh, it's a freaking laser. When the little pro head freaking laser. When the little pro head freaking laser. When the little pro head pops up, that's my TLDDR for you all pops up, that's my TLDDR for you all pops up, that's my TLDDR for you all kind of breaking down what's going kind of breaking down what's going kind of breaking down what's going on. The CRA is just the latest in a long on. The CRA is just the latest in a long on. The CRA is just the latest in a long line of about a hundred years of ACE law line of about a hundred years of ACE law line of about a hundred years of ACE law that are applicable within cyber that are applicable within cyber that are applicable within cyber security around the globe. It is not the security around the globe. It is not the security around the globe. It is not the only law. It won't be the last, but it only law. It won't be the last, but it only law. It won't be the last, but it certainly is one that has a lot of certainly is one that has a lot of certainly is one that has a lot of consequences for folks that either uh consequences for folks that either uh consequences for folks that either uh live or work in the European Union or if live or work in the European Union or if live or work in the European Union or if your organization is selling uh products your organization is selling uh products your organization is selling uh products with digital elements to European citizens. Basically, the CRA is designed citizens. Basically, the CRA is designed citizens. Basically, the CRA is designed to be a consumer protection law that to to be a consumer protection law that to to be a consumer protection law that to give European citizens the ability to be named whole again after a cyber be named whole again after a cyber be named whole again after a cyber security breach. This is one of the security breach. This is one of the security breach. This is one of the first laws that that we're aware of that first laws that that we're aware of that first laws that that we're aware of that talks about open source software in talks about open source software in talks about open source software in particular. There's been a great new particular. There's been a great new particular. There's been a great new role added in we'll talk about in a few role added in we'll talk about in a few role added in we'll talk about in a few seconds that pertains specifically to seconds that pertains specifically to seconds that pertains specifically to open source. Um but this is designed to open source. Um but this is designed to open source. Um but this is designed to basically um if there's some type of basically um if there's some type of basically um if there's some type of incident, if somebody has a phone and incident, if somebody has a phone and incident, if somebody has a phone and their their personal data is exposed, their their personal data is exposed, their their personal data is exposed, they come to some harm, it gives the they come to some harm, it gives the they come to some harm, it gives the European citizen who needs to get European citizen who needs to get European citizen who needs to get treatment from that. It is uh very consequential from that. It is uh very consequential from that. It is uh very consequential from my perspective. I feel that a lot of my perspective. I feel that a lot of my perspective. I feel that a lot of what the legislators put together is what the legislators put together is what the legislators put together is trying to codify into law what I have trying to codify into law what I have trying to codify into law what I have been using throughout my cyber security been using throughout my cyber security been using throughout my cyber security practice for for years or so. Um the practice for for years or so. Um the practice for for years or so. Um the newest innovation is talking about newest innovation is talking about newest innovation is talking about sbombs but everything else in there is sbombs but everything else in there is sbombs but everything else in there is stuff. It's CISSP 101. It's mom and stuff. It's CISSP 101. It's mom and stuff. It's CISSP 101. It's mom and apple pie protecting CRA software apple pie protecting CRA software apple pie protecting CRA software development life cycle vulnerability development life cycle vulnerability development life cycle vulnerability management. So these aren't like new management. So these aren't like new management. So these aren't like new concepts but what they did unlike how we concepts but what they did unlike how we concepts but what they did unlike how we do it here in the states is they put do it here in the states is they put do it here in the states is they put this in the law um in the United States this in the law um in the United States this in the law um in the United States will typically do things through our will typically do things through our will typically do things through our procurement system government procurement system government procurement system government procurement and kind of force the procurement and kind of force the procurement and kind of force the vendors through that means it's not vendors through that means it's not vendors through that means it's not legal action but if you want to sell the legal action but if you want to sell the legal action but if you want to sell the government you need to do what they do government you need to do what they do government you need to do what they do Europe took a different tactic where Europe took a different tactic where Europe took a different tactic where they put this in the law there are some very severe law there are some very severe law there are some very severe consequences for non-compliance If you are non-compliant with the If you are non-compliant with the If you are non-compliant with the requirements, that could be up requirements, that could be up requirements, that could be up to two and a half times to two and a half times to two and a half times your annual turnover, your annual your annual turnover, your annual your annual turnover, your annual revenue for last year for each revenue for last year for each revenue for last year for each incident. If you talk about providing incident. If you talk about providing incident. If you talk about providing misleading information, that's potential misleading information, that's potential misleading information, that's potential 1% of your revenue 1% of your revenue 1% of your revenue penalty. So, and that's per incident. So penalty. So, and that's per incident. So penalty. So, and that's per incident. So if you have a product that has many if you have a product that has many if you have a product that has many complex components, there are potential complex components, there are potential complex components, there are potential that you could rack up a pretty that you could rack up a pretty that you could rack up a pretty substantial bill if this would go to substantial bill if this would go to substantial bill if this would go to court. There are some uh unique European court. There are some uh unique European court. There are some uh unique European laws are written very differently than laws are written very differently than laws are written very differently than here in the states there. It's very here in the states there. It's very here in the states there. It's very wordy and very nuanced and there are wordy and very nuanced and there are wordy and very nuanced and there are some terms that they use again and again some terms that they use again and again some terms that they use again and again and again. Uh the first one is products and again. Uh the first one is products and again. Uh the first one is products with digital elements and this is a with digital elements and this is a with digital elements and this is a hardware or software product and hardware or software product and hardware or software product and including its remote data processing including its remote data processing including its remote data processing solutions. So if you have a app on a solutions. So if you have a app on a solutions. So if you have a app on a phone and it requires some type of cloud phone and it requires some type of cloud phone and it requires some type of cloud infrastructure to support that some type infrastructure to support that some type infrastructure to support that some type of server you know that becomes in of server you know that becomes in of server you know that becomes in scope. Broadly hyperscalers are not scope. Broadly hyperscalers are not scope. Broadly hyperscalers are not uh obliged for extra things under this uh obliged for extra things under this uh obliged for extra things under this law. There's a different lock for law. There's a different lock for law. There's a different lock for hyperscalers and cloud. But again, if hyperscalers and cloud. But again, if hyperscalers and cloud. But again, if you have some type of element, some type you have some type of element, some type you have some type of element, some type of remote processing that is included as of remote processing that is included as of remote processing that is included as part of your product. Your product can't part of your product. Your product can't part of your product. Your product can't work if you have a toy that has a work if you have a toy that has a work if you have a toy that has a database of things at the cloud and database of things at the cloud and database of things at the cloud and that's required for that product to that's required for that product to that's required for that product to work. That is in scope along. So you'll work. That is in scope along. So you'll work. That is in scope along. So you'll see the PTE product with digital see the PTE product with digital see the PTE product with digital elements all the thing. Uh there are two elements all the thing. Uh there are two elements all the thing. Uh there are two other phrases that my first reading I other phrases that my first reading I other phrases that my first reading I failed to capture. the nuance of but failed to capture. the nuance of but failed to capture. the nuance of but you'll see this again and again again you'll see this again and again again you'll see this again and again again where you'll see the term placing on the where you'll see the term placing on the where you'll see the term placing on the market. This is the first time that you market. This is the first time that you market. This is the first time that you put this product for sale within the put this product for sale within the put this product for sale within the union and then there's making available union and then there's making available union and then there's making available on the market. Um and this is considered on the market. Um and this is considered on the market. Um and this is considered commercial activity and this is all commercial activity and this is all commercial activity and this is all focused around the exchange of money. So focused around the exchange of money. So focused around the exchange of money. So that's not and this is where getting that's not and this is where getting that's not and this is where getting into my particular slice of open source into my particular slice of open source into my particular slice of open source a lot of open source developers have a lot of open source developers have a lot of open source developers have been been been will not there are no compliance will not there are no compliance will not there are no compliance obligations for a up obligations for a up obligations for a up maintainer. But as you read the law maintainer. But as you read the law maintainer. But as you read the law again, you you'll see phrases like this again, you you'll see phrases like this again, you you'll see phrases like this and you'll just need to kind of sus and you'll just need to kind of sus and you'll just need to kind of sus apart what they were going for in apart what they were going for in apart what they were going for in particular. There are broadly three roles. This is There are broadly three roles. This is There are broadly three roles. This is primarily focused on manufacturers and primarily focused on manufacturers and primarily focused on manufacturers and we consider this to be commercial we consider this to be commercial we consider this to be commercial vendors. I sell a router. I vendors. I sell a router. I vendors. I sell a router. I sell this type of sell this type of sell this type of thing, but it does include the new role and this is like include the new role and this is like include the new role and this is like even creat this new role, the open source creat this new role, the open source creat this new role, the open source steward. And this is some type of legal steward. And this is some type of legal steward. And this is some type of legal entity that works with sher and stewards entity that works with sher and stewards entity that works with sher and stewards a open source a open source a open source project. Broadly, you can think about project. Broadly, you can think about project. Broadly, you can think about this as a open source foundation like this as a open source foundation like this as a open source foundation like Apache Linux Foundation, those types of Apache Linux Foundation, those types of Apache Linux Foundation, those types of entities. But that's not those aren't entities. But that's not those aren't entities. But that's not those aren't the only people that can be stewards. the only people that can be stewards. the only people that can be stewards. And there is a specific section that And there is a specific section that And there is a specific section that speaks to the stewardship obligations. speaks to the stewardship obligations. speaks to the stewardship obligations. So most of you probably are not So most of you probably are not So most of you probably are not stewards. You might be in some cases, stewards. You might be in some cases, stewards. You might be in some cases, but again read the law, talk to your but again read the law, talk to your but again read the law, talk to your lawyer to help understand what your lawyer to help understand what your lawyer to help understand what your specific obligations are. specific obligations are. specific obligations are. And again, there's developers. They talk And again, there's developers. They talk And again, there's developers. They talk a lot about distributors and importers. a lot about distributors and importers. a lot about distributors and importers. Most of us aren't in those types of Most of us aren't in those types of Most of us aren't in those types of roles. But again, this is focused on the roles. But again, this is focused on the roles. But again, this is focused on the European consumer to protect their European consumer to protect their European consumer to protect their rights. rights. rights. uh they will use the term seesert a lot uh they will use the term seesert a lot uh they will use the term seesert a lot and within and within and within first we understand that there are first we understand that there are first we understand that there are different types of security teams and different types of security teams and different types of security teams and the context with which they use is how the context with which they use is how the context with which they use is how we would understand we would understand we would understand CERT a computer emergency response team CERT a computer emergency response team CERT a computer emergency response team not a corporate security incident not a corporate security incident not a corporate security incident response team or a product security response team or a product security response team or a product security incident response team so you'll see incident response team so you'll see incident response team so you'll see that in the law and that's actually that in the law and that's actually that in the law and that's actually defined find in the blue guide as well. defined find in the blue guide as well. defined find in the blue guide as well. I I I think my pal Fukami put this little mind think my pal Fukami put this little mind think my pal Fukami put this little mind map map map together. Super easy to understand. I'm together. Super easy to understand. I'm together. Super easy to understand. I'm sure you immediately all get it. But sure you immediately all get it. But sure you immediately all get it. But this talks about the different roles. this talks about the different roles. this talks about the different roles. You have manufacturers and distributors You have manufacturers and distributors You have manufacturers and distributors and importers. Um where's open source and importers. Um where's open source and importers. Um where's open source steward? Open source steward's in there steward? Open source steward's in there steward? Open source steward's in there somewhere. Um but basically this talks somewhere. Um but basically this talks somewhere. Um but basically this talks about all the different roles. talks about all the different roles. talks about all the different roles. talks about some of the differenth actions or about some of the differenth actions or about some of the differenth actions or responsibilities you have to take and responsibilities you have to take and responsibilities you have to take and this is available if you're curious um this is available if you're curious um this is available if you're curious um these slides are already in my GitHub these slides are already in my GitHub these slides are already in my GitHub repo and uh they should be available repo and uh they should be available repo and uh they should be available like I think through first as well but like I think through first as well but like I think through first as well but you can take a look at this picture and you can take a look at this picture and you can take a look at this picture and enjoy it all day long if you so desire the law is a lot I've had the desire the law is a lot I've had the desire the law is a lot I've had the opportunity to read it four times all opportunity to read it four times all opportunity to read it four times all the way through now which is wonderful the way through now which is wonderful the way through now which is wonderful uh but it's about 90 100 pages long, uh but it's about 90 100 pages long, uh but it's about 90 100 pages long, super great to fall asleep to, but there super great to fall asleep to, but there super great to fall asleep to, but there are uh certain sections that are more are uh certain sections that are more are uh certain sections that are more important than others. Um, article three important than others. Um, article three important than others. Um, article three talks about the definitions like in this talks about the definitions like in this talks about the definitions like in this context, this is what product with context, this is what product with context, this is what product with digital elements means and that echoes digital elements means and that echoes digital elements means and that echoes things that are in um like the blue things that are in um like the blue things that are in um like the blue guide and whatnot. Article six, seven, guide and whatnot. Article six, seven, guide and whatnot. Article six, seven, and 8 talks about critical and important and 8 talks about critical and important and 8 talks about critical and important products with digital elements. And products with digital elements. And products with digital elements. And that's predominantly where a lot of the that's predominantly where a lot of the that's predominantly where a lot of the administr comes into play. That if you administr comes into play. That if you administr comes into play. That if you have a product that qualifies as a have a product that qualifies as a have a product that qualifies as a critical or important thing, you have critical or important thing, you have critical or important thing, you have more work to do talking with the market more work to do talking with the market more work to do talking with the market surveillance authorities or interacting surveillance authorities or interacting surveillance authorities or interacting more with a national or you know more with a national or you know more with a national or you know whatever that might be. Article 13 talks whatever that might be. Article 13 talks whatever that might be. Article 13 talks about obligations of manufacturers and about obligations of manufacturers and about obligations of manufacturers and you know blah blah blah blah blah blah. you know blah blah blah blah blah blah. you know blah blah blah blah blah blah. You should I would uh strongly encourage You should I would uh strongly encourage You should I would uh strongly encourage everyone that if you have some type of everyone that if you have some type of everyone that if you have some type of role obligation within your company role obligation within your company role obligation within your company managing the security of products you managing the security of products you managing the security of products you need to take a look at this just to need to take a look at this just to need to take a look at this just to understand be familiar with uh some of understand be familiar with uh some of understand be familiar with uh some of the things and again I'll do the little the things and again I'll do the little the things and again I'll do the little bit of TLDDR here for bit of TLDDR here for bit of TLDDR here for you. There are a couple other documents you. There are a couple other documents you. There are a couple other documents that are adjacent to the CRA. You have that are adjacent to the CRA. You have that are adjacent to the CRA. You have the product liability directive and this the product liability directive and this the product liability directive and this talks about more this is more about the talks about more this is more about the talks about more this is more about the legal end of things that if a EU citizen legal end of things that if a EU citizen legal end of things that if a EU citizen feels hurt damaged by your product this feels hurt damaged by your product this feels hurt damaged by your product this is kind of how that process works. Uh is kind of how that process works. Uh is kind of how that process works. Uh there is the blue guide which is how all there is the blue guide which is how all there is the blue guide which is how all the definitions u used throughout EU the definitions u used throughout EU the definitions u used throughout EU legislation. It's like a dictionary, so legislation. It's like a dictionary, so legislation. It's like a dictionary, so to speak. And again, my pal Fukami, to speak. And again, my pal Fukami, to speak. And again, my pal Fukami, these are all of the other either uh these are all of the other either uh these are all of the other either uh laws, directives, or kind of adjacent uh laws, directives, or kind of adjacent uh laws, directives, or kind of adjacent uh bills or things that are in the orbit of bills or things that are in the orbit of bills or things that are in the orbit of the CRA. So, it's a lot. Again, I have a the CRA. So, it's a lot. Again, I have a the CRA. So, it's a lot. Again, I have a link to a spreadsheet that details this link to a spreadsheet that details this link to a spreadsheet that details this and if you're curious, but the the law and if you're curious, but the the law and if you're curious, but the the law itself is written. It's done, but they itself is written. It's done, but they itself is written. It's done, but they will be amending it. And there are other will be amending it. And there are other will be amending it. And there are other things there's an interaction like for things there's an interaction like for things there's an interaction like for example if you make um aircraft or example if you make um aircraft or example if you make um aircraft or marine equipment there's different set marine equipment there's different set marine equipment there's different set of laws and there's like a precedence of laws and there's like a precedence of laws and there's like a precedence depending on which law depending on which law depending on which law uh h is uh in the hierarchy which ones uh h is uh in the hierarchy which ones uh h is uh in the hierarchy which ones has more uh precedence over others but has more uh precedence over others but has more uh precedence over others but these are all things that are kind of these are all things that are kind of these are all things that are kind of CRA CRA CRA adjacent so this is first we are product adjacent so this is first we are product adjacent so this is first we are product security and incident response we're all security and incident response we're all security and incident response we're all awesome some people. I'm going to focus awesome some people. I'm going to focus awesome some people. I'm going to focus my conversation on things that product my conversation on things that product my conversation on things that product security teams need to be aware of out security teams need to be aware of out security teams need to be aware of out of the law. We have a lot of of the law. We have a lot of of the law. We have a lot of conversations today talking about the conversations today talking about the conversations today talking about the CRA from different aspects. I'm laser CRA from different aspects. I'm laser CRA from different aspects. I'm laser focused on product security teams. There focused on product security teams. There focused on product security teams. There are certain things that these are certain things that these are certain things that these organizations will need to do and be organizations will need to do and be organizations will need to do and be aware of and hopefully you have a lot of aware of and hopefully you have a lot of aware of and hopefully you have a lot of these processes in place and it's just a these processes in place and it's just a these processes in place and it's just a matter of tuning it to come out a little matter of tuning it to come out a little matter of tuning it to come out a little faster or produce evidence a little bit faster or produce evidence a little bit faster or produce evidence a little bit different way. But that's what how we different way. But that's what how we different way. But that's what how we are looking at this. I'm going to talk are looking at this. I'm going to talk are looking at this. I'm going to talk about annex one. Annex1 has 21 about annex one. Annex1 has 21 about annex one. Annex1 has 21 requirements. They're roughly split into requirements. They're roughly split into requirements. They're roughly split into two categories. The first is uh classic two categories. The first is uh classic two categories. The first is uh classic cyber security. Secure by default, cyber security. Secure by default, cyber security. Secure by default, secure by design type things, SDLC. The secure by design type things, SDLC. The secure by design type things, SDLC. The second half is all about vulnerability second half is all about vulnerability second half is all about vulnerability disclosure, vulnerability coordination, disclosure, vulnerability coordination, disclosure, vulnerability coordination, which is again the bread and butter of a which is again the bread and butter of a which is again the bread and butter of a product security team. product security team. product security team. So within annex So within annex So within annex one they it is now an expectation and one they it is now an expectation and one they it is now an expectation and unlike here in the states where we had unlike here in the states where we had unlike here in the states where we had the secure by design the secure by design the secure by design promise we're promising we'll do the promise we're promising we'll do the promise we're promising we'll do the right things. It's now the law in Europe right things. It's now the law in Europe right things. It's now the law in Europe and will go into effect in December and will go into effect in December and will go into effect in December 2027. Uh but you are required to make 2027. Uh but you are required to make 2027. Uh but you are required to make your products secure by design, secure your products secure by design, secure your products secure by design, secure by default. And there's certain evidence by default. And there's certain evidence by default. And there's certain evidence that you will need to produce and share that you will need to produce and share that you will need to produce and share with the market surveillance authorities with the market surveillance authorities with the market surveillance authorities or um there's a process where you need or um there's a process where you need or um there's a process where you need to have your product certified going to have your product certified going to have your product certified going through the CE mark process potentially through the CE mark process potentially through the CE mark process potentially and you might need to share it with and you might need to share it with and you might need to share it with those and other times you're obliged to those and other times you're obliged to those and other times you're obliged to cooperate with a national cooperate with a national cooperate with a national certa is kind of the equivalent to the certa is kind of the equivalent to the certa is kind of the equivalent to the US CISA agency they're responsible for US CISA agency they're responsible for US CISA agency they're responsible for coordination across the whole union um coordination across the whole union um coordination across the whole union um so you'll need to potentially provide so you'll need to potentially provide so you'll need to potentially provide information or artifact tax to INISA a information or artifact tax to INISA a information or artifact tax to INISA a national market surveillance authority national market surveillance authority national market surveillance authority or the CE mark auditor so to speak. So or the CE mark auditor so to speak. So or the CE mark auditor so to speak. So you'll need to make sure you have your you'll need to make sure you have your you'll need to make sure you have your documentation in order. How was your documentation in order. How was your documentation in order. How was your solution designed and architected in a solution designed and architected in a solution designed and architected in a way that is uh secure as it can be way that is uh secure as it can be way that is uh secure as it can be before it goes out the door. Hopefully before it goes out the door. Hopefully before it goes out the door. Hopefully you already do this. Your documentation you already do this. Your documentation you already do this. Your documentation may not be great. Well, you've got about may not be great. Well, you've got about may not be great. Well, you've got about two years to get it in a shape that will two years to get it in a shape that will two years to get it in a shape that will be acceptable if you're when you're be acceptable if you're when you're be acceptable if you're when you're called in to do an audit, so to called in to do an audit, so to called in to do an audit, so to speak. Uh, next item, uh, part of annex speak. Uh, next item, uh, part of annex speak. Uh, next item, uh, part of annex one. Uh, item two is talking about your one. Uh, item two is talking about your one. Uh, item two is talking about your product must not be, uh, put placed on product must not be, uh, put placed on product must not be, uh, put placed on the market without any known exploitable the market without any known exploitable the market without any known exploitable vulnerabilities with any. What did I vulnerabilities with any. What did I vulnerabilities with any. What did I say? Oh, it needs to be without. But say? Oh, it needs to be without. But say? Oh, it needs to be without. But yeah, you can't have any exploited vans. yeah, you can't have any exploited vans. yeah, you can't have any exploited vans. And that's a process kind of on the tail And that's a process kind of on the tail And that's a process kind of on the tail end of your SDLC before the product goes end of your SDLC before the product goes end of your SDLC before the product goes out the door. Most of you today probably out the door. Most of you today probably out the door. Most of you today probably do some type of scan using a source code do some type of scan using a source code do some type of scan using a source code analysis or whatever tooling. So, you're analysis or whatever tooling. So, you're analysis or whatever tooling. So, you're going to need to provide evidence that going to need to provide evidence that going to need to provide evidence that on this day when we started to sell this on this day when we started to sell this on this day when we started to sell this product, we are not aware of any product, we are not aware of any product, we are not aware of any exploited bones within our package. You exploited bones within our package. You exploited bones within our package. You probably are doing this today. hopefully probably are doing this today. hopefully probably are doing this today. hopefully if you aren't strongly consider you if you aren't strongly consider you if you aren't strongly consider you start doing it this afternoon uh so that start doing it this afternoon uh so that start doing it this afternoon uh so that you can be prepared because again this u you can be prepared because again this u you can be prepared because again this u we will get um as we're going through we will get um as we're going through we will get um as we're going through the amendment process with the the amendment process with the the amendment process with the commission and organizations like commission and organizations like commission and organizations like Senelac and Etsy u we're going to get Senelac and Etsy u we're going to get Senelac and Etsy u we're going to get uh examples of implementation so we'll uh examples of implementation so we'll uh examples of implementation so we'll get an example of what the artifact will get an example of what the artifact will get an example of what the artifact will look like what they desire it to be so look like what they desire it to be so look like what they desire it to be so again getting yourself set up that you again getting yourself set up that you again getting yourself set up that you can produce this report today will help can produce this report today will help can produce this report today will help you easily adjust if they want it you easily adjust if they want it you easily adjust if they want it formatted differently or they need formatted differently or they need formatted differently or they need different data elements. So again, different data elements. So again, different data elements. So again, starting October 2027 is a bad idea. starting October 2027 is a bad idea. starting October 2027 is a bad idea. Start this afternoon if you haven't Start this afternoon if you haven't Start this afternoon if you haven't already. A lot of folks in this room already. A lot of folks in this room already. A lot of folks in this room already have programs within their already have programs within their already have programs within their organizations to help manage their um organizations to help manage their um organizations to help manage their um interactions with the CRA. And this is a interactions with the CRA. And this is a interactions with the CRA. And this is a larger corporate issue, but again we're larger corporate issue, but again we're larger corporate issue, but again we're focused specifically on the pro how the focused specifically on the pro how the focused specifically on the pro how the product security team can help your product security team can help your product security team can help your organization be organization be organization be compliant. Um, annex one item three compliant. Um, annex one item three compliant. Um, annex one item three talks about a risk assessment. You need talks about a risk assessment. You need talks about a risk assessment. You need to be doing risk assessments. You to be doing risk assessments. You to be doing risk assessments. You probably all are doing this today. ENISA probably all are doing this today. ENISA probably all are doing this today. ENISA has a toolbox framework of how they do has a toolbox framework of how they do has a toolbox framework of how they do risk assessments. uh there'll be a risk assessments. uh there'll be a risk assessments. uh there'll be a particular methodology they would like particular methodology they would like particular methodology they would like you to follow and I think it broadly you to follow and I think it broadly you to follow and I think it broadly follows ISO 27,05 I think but they will follows ISO 27,05 I think but they will follows ISO 27,05 I think but they will want to you will need to provide want to you will need to provide want to you will need to provide evidence that you have done a risk evidence that you have done a risk evidence that you have done a risk assessment you do risk assessments all assessment you do risk assessments all assessment you do risk assessments all throughout the product's life cycle throughout the product's life cycle throughout the product's life cycle you'll need to understand how this you'll need to understand how this you'll need to understand how this product is used by customers how you product is used by customers how you product is used by customers how you know threat modeling it to how it could know threat modeling it to how it could know threat modeling it to how it could be broken and what controls you're be broken and what controls you're be broken and what controls you're putting into place to stop these putting into place to stop these putting into place to stop these potential uh vulnerabilities or potential uh vulnerabilities or potential uh vulnerabilities or weaknesses So there's a whole section weaknesses So there's a whole section weaknesses So there's a whole section here that talks just about the risk here that talks just about the risk here that talks just about the risk assessment and types of things you'll assessment and types of things you'll assessment and types of things you'll need to be doing, but basically it boils need to be doing, but basically it boils need to be doing, but basically it boils down to you need to protect CIA of your down to you need to protect CIA of your down to you need to protect CIA of your product and think about uh protecting product and think about uh protecting product and think about uh protecting customer data. The they talk a lot about risk data. The they talk a lot about risk data. The they talk a lot about risk management. If you look at article 134, management. If you look at article 134, management. If you look at article 134, it talks about um as you're going it talks about um as you're going it talks about um as you're going through the uh market surveillance through the uh market surveillance through the uh market surveillance authority process, you will need to authority process, you will need to authority process, you will need to share with the regulators your risk share with the regulators your risk share with the regulators your risk assessment. So again, you might do this assessment. So again, you might do this assessment. So again, you might do this informally today. I strongly encourage informally today. I strongly encourage informally today. I strongly encourage you to uh look at an's uh framework. Um you to uh look at an's uh framework. Um you to uh look at an's uh framework. Um BSI did a I think a better written BSI did a I think a better written BSI did a I think a better written version of the Anissa workflow. BSI is version of the Anissa workflow. BSI is version of the Anissa workflow. BSI is the German equivalent to CISA. great the German equivalent to CISA. great the German equivalent to CISA. great folks. Um, but you know, take a look at folks. Um, but you know, take a look at folks. Um, but you know, take a look at one of those two items and start to one of those two items and start to one of those two items and start to shift your program to make sure you're shift your program to make sure you're shift your program to make sure you're accounting for the things they want you accounting for the things they want you accounting for the things they want you to have like a risk register talking to have like a risk register talking to have like a risk register talking about formal steps you've taken to about formal steps you've taken to about formal steps you've taken to mitigate um threats and weaknesses and vaults. And again, uh you probably are vaults. And again, uh you probably are vaults. And again, uh you probably are doing something today. You might be doing something today. You might be doing something today. You might be following uh NIST or CES's risk following uh NIST or CES's risk following uh NIST or CES's risk management management management framework. It may be equivalent, might framework. It may be equivalent, might framework. It may be equivalent, might not. And I would just encourage you to not. And I would just encourage you to not. And I would just encourage you to uh go straight to the source. ENISA is a uh go straight to the source. ENISA is a uh go straight to the source. ENISA is a name in it is an entity named by name in name in it is an entity named by name in name in it is an entity named by name in the law several times. So they wrote the law several times. So they wrote the law several times. So they wrote something. I would encourage you to look something. I would encourage you to look something. I would encourage you to look at that and consider that the standard at that and consider that the standard at that and consider that the standard of quality you need to of quality you need to of quality you need to follow. We jump down to the second follow. We jump down to the second follow. We jump down to the second section which is talking about section which is talking about section which is talking about vulnerability handling. vulnerability handling. vulnerability handling. And again hopefully all my friends here And again hopefully all my friends here And again hopefully all my friends here this should not be new. Your team should this should not be new. Your team should this should not be new. Your team should have these capabilities and do these have these capabilities and do these have these capabilities and do these things although you might not be things although you might not be things although you might not be following the specific desired time following the specific desired time following the specific desired time frames and that's where you're going to frames and that's where you're going to frames and that's where you're going to need to make some adjustments to your need to make some adjustments to your need to make some adjustments to your program. Uh first item here esbomb say program. Uh first item here esbomb say program. Uh first item here esbomb say esbomb three times and Allen Freriedman esbomb three times and Allen Freriedman esbomb three times and Allen Freriedman shows up. Uh but they are requ the law shows up. Uh but they are requ the law shows up. Uh but they are requ the law requires you to at request give uh the requires you to at request give uh the requires you to at request give uh the market surveillance authority or ana or market surveillance authority or ana or market surveillance authority or ana or other entities your software bill of other entities your software bill of other entities your software bill of materials. Um you're not required to materials. Um you're not required to materials. Um you're not required to publicly publish it. You're not required publicly publish it. You're not required publicly publish it. You're not required necessarily to give it to your customers necessarily to give it to your customers necessarily to give it to your customers but you must give it to the legal but you must give it to the legal but you must give it to the legal authorities. So, if you aren't doing authorities. So, if you aren't doing authorities. So, if you aren't doing sbombs today, you better figure that out sbombs today, you better figure that out sbombs today, you better figure that out this afternoon and figure out a way that this afternoon and figure out a way that this afternoon and figure out a way that you're going to uh produce that at you're going to uh produce that at you're going to uh produce that at request. And uh one of the request. And uh one of the request. And uh one of the standardization pathways, there's standardization pathways, there's standardization pathways, there's about 41 41 to 50 different about 41 41 to 50 different about 41 41 to 50 different standardization work streams, which is standardization work streams, which is standardization work streams, which is awesome. Um one of those will be talking awesome. Um one of those will be talking awesome. Um one of those will be talking about defining what they what the about defining what they what the about defining what they what the Europeans want to see in their ESBOM. Europeans want to see in their ESBOM. Europeans want to see in their ESBOM. Hopefully it hues closely to the minimum Hopefully it hues closely to the minimum Hopefully it hues closely to the minimum uh required elements for ESBOM that CISA uh required elements for ESBOM that CISA uh required elements for ESBOM that CISA and NIA published but we don't know that and NIA published but we don't know that and NIA published but we don't know that for a fact. So there will be an for a fact. So there will be an for a fact. So there will be an amendment that speaks to um what the amendment that speaks to um what the amendment that speaks to um what the ESBOM artifact needs to have. So again ESBOM artifact needs to have. So again ESBOM artifact needs to have. So again get your capability in place today that get your capability in place today that get your capability in place today that you can repeatedly create an ESBOM and I you can repeatedly create an ESBOM and I you can repeatedly create an ESBOM and I would encourage you to make esbomb. would encourage you to make esbomb. would encourage you to make esbomb. There's you know six different types. I There's you know six different types. I There's you know six different types. I would encourage you to leverage all six would encourage you to leverage all six would encourage you to leverage all six depending on what the use case is. They depending on what the use case is. They depending on what the use case is. They have different applications, but have different applications, but have different applications, but probably they're going to want to have probably they're going to want to have probably they're going to want to have the uh the build sbomb is probably what the uh the build sbomb is probably what the uh the build sbomb is probably what you'll need to share with them, but I you'll need to share with them, but I you'll need to share with them, but I don't know that for a fact yet. You need to make sure that you have yet. You need to make sure that you have yet. You need to make sure that you have the capability to remediate the capability to remediate the capability to remediate vulnerabilities without delay and vulnerabilities without delay and vulnerabilities without delay and including providing security updates. Uh including providing security updates. Uh including providing security updates. Uh if you're a psert, I hope you're doing if you're a psert, I hope you're doing if you're a psert, I hope you're doing this today. uh the without delay I this today. uh the without delay I this today. uh the without delay I haven't seen exactly what that target haven't seen exactly what that target haven't seen exactly what that target means uh but again be prepared to if means uh but again be prepared to if means uh but again be prepared to if there's a vulnerability you can react there's a vulnerability you can react there's a vulnerability you can react and issue a fix. What I personally enjoy about the law, What I personally enjoy about the law, What I personally enjoy about the law, aside from the fact it's codifying cyber aside from the fact it's codifying cyber aside from the fact it's codifying cyber security uh and everything I've been security uh and everything I've been security uh and everything I've been telling people asking people to do for telling people asking people to do for telling people asking people to do for years is they encourage better upstream years is they encourage better upstream years is they encourage better upstream engagement by ma for manufacturers. engagement by ma for manufacturers. engagement by ma for manufacturers. So uh depending on which report you read So uh depending on which report you read So uh depending on which report you read between 70 and 906 96% of commercial between 70 and 906 96% of commercial between 70 and 906 96% of commercial software includes open source components software includes open source components software includes open source components and the law here encourages and the law here encourages and the law here encourages manufacturers to engage with upstream manufacturers to engage with upstream manufacturers to engage with upstream things like if you make your own fix things like if you make your own fix things like if you make your own fix contribute that back upstream. If your contribute that back upstream. If your contribute that back upstream. If your software, you know, doesn't have um software, you know, doesn't have um software, you know, doesn't have um isn't supported, you know, if it doesn't isn't supported, you know, if it doesn't isn't supported, you know, if it doesn't have infrastructure or maintainers, the have infrastructure or maintainers, the have infrastructure or maintainers, the manufacturers are encouraged to manufacturers are encouraged to manufacturers are encouraged to participate and make those upstream participate and make those upstream participate and make those upstream components stronger because you're the components stronger because you're the components stronger because you're the one selling them for money, not the one selling them for money, not the one selling them for money, not the upstream maintainer or upstream maintainer or upstream maintainer or project. But, uh, basically, they tell project. But, uh, basically, they tell project. But, uh, basically, they tell you that they want you to share the you that they want you to share the you that they want you to share the patches upstream, which I think is patches upstream, which I think is patches upstream, which I think is great. I'm very excited about that great. I'm very excited about that great. I'm very excited about that because that's how the software that you because that's how the software that you because that's how the software that you all depend on upstream is going to all depend on upstream is going to all depend on upstream is going to continue to be able to thrive and you continue to be able to thrive and you continue to be able to thrive and you know leverage within your products. Mr. know leverage within your products. Mr. know leverage within your products. Mr. cell microphone please sir other than a stern turning telling off other than a stern turning telling off other than a stern turning telling off do we know uh what happens if you don't do we know uh what happens if you don't do we know uh what happens if you don't share those upstream we don't I've not share those upstream we don't I've not share those upstream we don't I've not been given an indication about well what been given an indication about well what been given an indication about well what the consequences may be if you don't the consequences may be if you don't the consequences may be if you don't share upstream share upstream share upstream um we'll see they'll they'll figure that um we'll see they'll they'll figure that um we'll see they'll they'll figure that out oh do we have a question from out oh do we have a question from out oh do we have a question from Discord oh okay well that makes me say Discord oh okay well that makes me say Discord oh okay well that makes me say So again, if you use open source So again, if you use open source So again, if you use open source software, and I'm pretty sure you all software, and I'm pretty sure you all software, and I'm pretty sure you all do, it's in your best interest to do, it's in your best interest to do, it's in your best interest to understand how those upstream projects understand how those upstream projects understand how those upstream projects work and how best you can help them be work and how best you can help them be work and how best you can help them be sustainable and vital because some of sustainable and vital because some of sustainable and vital because some of these obligations that you're going to these obligations that you're going to these obligations that you're going to see here in a slide or two are very see here in a slide or two are very see here in a slide or two are very strict on you and Upstream has no strict on you and Upstream has no strict on you and Upstream has no obligation to help you obligation to help you obligation to help you out. Upstream people are nice. They like out. Upstream people are nice. They like out. Upstream people are nice. They like helping, but they're not required to do helping, but they're not required to do helping, but they're not required to do anything in the anything in the anything in the law. Uh something you may or may not law. Uh something you may or may not law. Uh something you may or may not have today is a formal support uh have today is a formal support uh have today is a formal support uh policy. We you know on this date this policy. We you know on this date this policy. We you know on this date this product is supported for blah time. The product is supported for blah time. The product is supported for blah time. The law codifies that you will publish your law codifies that you will publish your law codifies that you will publish your support period and it will be at least support period and it will be at least support period and it will be at least five years from the last major change. five years from the last major change. five years from the last major change. So there's uh some interesting uh So there's uh some interesting uh So there's uh some interesting uh nuances to this. Um if you provide um nuances to this. Um if you provide um nuances to this. Um if you provide um what's was the term substantive change I what's was the term substantive change I what's was the term substantive change I think. So if you do a service pack for a think. So if you do a service pack for a think. So if you do a service pack for a product and you update it, it's product and you update it, it's product and you update it, it's considered a major substantial change, considered a major substantial change, considered a major substantial change, your five-year timer resets to that date your five-year timer resets to that date your five-year timer resets to that date that you drop that service pack. So this that you drop that service pack. So this that you drop that service pack. So this is a rolling date. You need to be aware is a rolling date. You need to be aware is a rolling date. You need to be aware of that because you your products may of that because you your products may of that because you your products may not have you may not publish a support not have you may not publish a support not have you may not publish a support life cycle but you will need to and life cycle but you will need to and life cycle but you will need to and again thinking about that 80 to 96% of again thinking about that 80 to 96% of again thinking about that 80 to 96% of your components upstream sure as heck your components upstream sure as heck your components upstream sure as heck doesn't have this. So how are you going doesn't have this. So how are you going doesn't have this. So how are you going to be able to fulfill your obligations to be able to fulfill your obligations to be able to fulfill your obligations without the help of these upstream without the help of these upstream without the help of these upstream folks? folks? folks? Oh. Oh well question from the handsome Oh. Oh well question from the handsome Oh. Oh well question from the handsome man in the unicorn tie. So, do do you man in the unicorn tie. So, do do you man in the unicorn tie. So, do do you think that that's going to discourage think that that's going to discourage think that that's going to discourage people from updating their software people from updating their software people from updating their software because they're going to realize that because they're going to realize that because they're going to realize that they if they do a major update or a they if they do a major update or a they if they do a major update or a substantive update, whatever that means. substantive update, whatever that means. substantive update, whatever that means. It re Yeah, that's what I was thinking. It re Yeah, that's what I was thinking. It re Yeah, that's what I was thinking. Well, as I move on to my slides, you'll Well, as I move on to my slides, you'll Well, as I move on to my slides, you'll find out you are not allowed not to find out you are not allowed not to find out you are not allowed not to update it. But again, remember this is a it. But again, remember this is a it. But again, remember this is a rolling date from the last substantive rolling date from the last substantive rolling date from the last substantive changes. Your five-year timer starts changes. Your five-year timer starts changes. Your five-year timer starts again. Careful there, sir. again. Careful there, sir. again. Careful there, sir. Question from the handsome man in the Question from the handsome man in the Question from the handsome man in the purple waist coat. Leading question. purple waist coat. Leading question. purple waist coat. Leading question. Lavender. How much can you charge people Lavender. How much can you charge people Lavender. How much can you charge people for these these updates? Cra, well, fun for these these updates? Cra, well, fun for these these updates? Cra, well, fun fact, the law now tells you you are fact, the law now tells you you are fact, the law now tells you you are forbidden for charging for security forbidden for charging for security forbidden for charging for security updates. It is illegal to do that. So, updates. It is illegal to do that. So, updates. It is illegal to do that. So, uh, you potentially need to figure out uh, you potentially need to figure out uh, you potentially need to figure out your revenue streams and how you're your revenue streams and how you're your revenue streams and how you're going to navigate that. Again, go talk going to navigate that. Again, go talk going to navigate that. Again, go talk to your legal weasel and they'll help to your legal weasel and they'll help to your legal weasel and they'll help you out with how your particular you out with how your particular you out with how your particular organization might uh react to that. Uh, yes, manufacturers shall that. Uh, yes, manufacturers shall that. Uh, yes, manufacturers shall ensure that each security update is ensure that each security update is ensure that each security update is available. Um, and the so you provide a available. Um, and the so you provide a available. Um, and the so you provide a patch, that patch must be accessible for patch, that patch must be accessible for patch, that patch must be accessible for 10 years. 10 years. 10 years. You may not have that capability today. You may not have that capability today. You may not have that capability today. It doesn't necessarily need to be on a It doesn't necessarily need to be on a It doesn't necessarily need to be on a public website. That would probably be public website. That would probably be public website. That would probably be smiled upon by the regulators, but it's smiled upon by the regulators, but it's smiled upon by the regulators, but it's not required. But you need to be able to not required. But you need to be able to not required. But you need to be able to have those patches for 10 years if a have those patches for 10 years if a have those patches for 10 years if a customer asks for customer asks for customer asks for it. Pretty great. And there's the it. Pretty great. And there's the it. Pretty great. And there's the substantial modification clause. You'll substantial modification clause. You'll substantial modification clause. You'll see this a bunch of times uh popping see this a bunch of times uh popping see this a bunch of times uh popping up. And let's see. and all of the uh the up. And let's see. and all of the uh the up. And let's see. and all of the uh the bolding, the color coding is my bolding, the color coding is my bolding, the color coding is my emphasis. Otherwise, the giving you a emphasis. Otherwise, the giving you a emphasis. Otherwise, the giving you a wall of legal text is not awesome. wall of legal text is not awesome. wall of legal text is not awesome. Question. Yeah, the does this work? It Question. Yeah, the does this work? It Question. Yeah, the does this work? It does. Hi, Bruce. Uh I Well, if you're does. Hi, Bruce. Uh I Well, if you're does. Hi, Bruce. Uh I Well, if you're going to have to give out security fixes going to have to give out security fixes going to have to give out security fixes for free, everyone's going to move to for free, everyone's going to move to for free, everyone's going to move to usage fees. You can't use it this month usage fees. You can't use it this month usage fees. You can't use it this month unless you pay so much money. So, that unless you pay so much money. So, that unless you pay so much money. So, that just converts security fixes into usage just converts security fixes into usage just converts security fixes into usage fees. So, how does this work with usage fees. So, how does this work with usage fees. So, how does this work with usage fees? Um, uh, you know, if you only paid fees? Um, uh, you know, if you only paid fees? Um, uh, you know, if you only paid up through the end of the year, then is up through the end of the year, then is up through the end of the year, then is the five-year obligation gone if you the five-year obligation gone if you the five-year obligation gone if you can't buy more or That's an excellent can't buy more or That's an excellent can't buy more or That's an excellent question for your legal weasels. I uh question for your legal weasels. I uh question for your legal weasels. I uh cannot provide that advice to you. They cannot provide that advice to you. They cannot provide that advice to you. They don't talk about usage fees. They talk don't talk about usage fees. They talk don't talk about usage fees. They talk about charging for security updates. So, about charging for security updates. So, about charging for security updates. So, I don't know if trying to change the I don't know if trying to change the I don't know if trying to change the name, you know, removes that obligation name, you know, removes that obligation name, you know, removes that obligation for you. Well, just a usage fee. It's for you. Well, just a usage fee. It's for you. Well, just a usage fee. It's not a security fee. It's a usage fee. not a security fee. It's a usage fee. not a security fee. It's a usage fee. You can't use my product, you know, like You can't use my product, you know, like You can't use my product, you know, like Adobe does. Mr. Brohannan, I think, has Adobe does. Mr. Brohannan, I think, has Adobe does. Mr. Brohannan, I think, has a question or comment. Yes, I will repeat the question or Yes, I will repeat the question or Yes, I will repeat the question or statement. doesn't it doesn't it doesn't it doesn't doesn't doesn't require there are two distinct elements. require there are two distinct elements. require there are two distinct elements. So regardless of whether you're target target target or funds were not or funds were not or funds were not so the clarification you have to give so the clarification you have to give so the clarification you have to give them the patch, but they can't use it. them the patch, but they can't use it. them the patch, but they can't use it. So, the clarification we got is um So, the clarification we got is um So, the clarification we got is um irregardless of your stance, you still irregardless of your stance, you still irregardless of your stance, you still obliged to support that product for five obliged to support that product for five obliged to support that product for five years. years. years. That's that's the fundamental I That's that's the fundamental I That's that's the fundamental I understand but or understand but or understand but or sure I'm just trying to understand what sure I'm just trying to understand what sure I'm just trying to understand what usage fees do to that because if I only usage fees do to that because if I only usage fees do to that because if I only if I only pay for one year having spent if I only pay for one year having spent if I only pay for one year having spent three years working okay it something you might want to talk okay it something you might want to talk okay it something you might want to talk with your legal friends and uh if you with your legal friends and uh if you with your legal friends and uh if you get the opportunity to talk with the get the opportunity to talk with the get the opportunity to talk with the commission or insa or anybody you commission or insa or anybody you commission or insa or anybody you probably a question you want to ask, but probably a question you want to ask, but probably a question you want to ask, but that is that is that is not I have not heard that question not I have not heard that question not I have not heard that question before, before, before, Bruce. And again, I'm not a lawyer. I'm Bruce. And again, I'm not a lawyer. I'm Bruce. And again, I'm not a lawyer. I'm just a guy doing security on the just a guy doing security on the just a guy doing security on the internet. When you place the product on the When you place the product on the When you place the product on the market, if you know or have reason to market, if you know or have reason to market, if you know or have reason to believe that your product is not in believe that your product is not in believe that your product is not in conformity with the EU, you shall conformity with the EU, you shall conformity with the EU, you shall immediately take corrective action. So, immediately take corrective action. So, immediately take corrective action. So, if you have a product today on the EU if you have a product today on the EU if you have a product today on the EU market and the law goes into effect in market and the law goes into effect in market and the law goes into effect in December of 2027, if that product is December of 2027, if that product is December of 2027, if that product is still available for sale, you are now still available for sale, you are now still available for sale, you are now obliged to fix the vulnerabilities in obliged to fix the vulnerabilities in obliged to fix the vulnerabilities in that potentially uh older that potentially uh older that potentially uh older product. Uh this is from my perspective product. Uh this is from my perspective product. Uh this is from my perspective retroactive. So, again, the it's not all retroactive. So, again, the it's not all retroactive. So, again, the it's not all your new stuff from December 2027 on. your new stuff from December 2027 on. your new stuff from December 2027 on. It's everything that exists within your It's everything that exists within your It's everything that exists within your espoused support espoused support espoused support window. So this uh will potentially be window. So this uh will potentially be window. So this uh will potentially be an engineering burden for your product an engineering burden for your product an engineering burden for your product teams. So as the product security teams. So as the product security teams. So as the product security representatives for your entities, I representatives for your entities, I representatives for your entities, I would strongly encourage you to go talk would strongly encourage you to go talk would strongly encourage you to go talk to your engineering teams and plan for to your engineering teams and plan for to your engineering teams and plan for how you will deal with that uh and how how you will deal with that uh and how how you will deal with that uh and how you plan to again try to maintain you plan to again try to maintain you plan to again try to maintain compliance with your obligations. compliance with your obligations. compliance with your obligations. uh you must regularly test and review uh you must regularly test and review uh you must regularly test and review your product. So again, ideally you're your product. So again, ideally you're your product. So again, ideally you're going through pentests, code audits, uh going through pentests, code audits, uh going through pentests, code audits, uh you have assorted scanners within your you have assorted scanners within your you have assorted scanners within your tooling and build infrastructure. You're tooling and build infrastructure. You're tooling and build infrastructure. You're going to need to be able to provide going to need to be able to provide going to need to be able to provide evidence of what that process is and evidence of what that process is and evidence of what that process is and potentially the results of those tests potentially the results of those tests potentially the results of those tests if the market surveillance affair if the market surveillance affair if the market surveillance affair authority asks you. This is probably authority asks you. This is probably authority asks you. This is probably something you don't have to do today. I something you don't have to do today. I something you don't have to do today. I back when I was at Red Hat, I had a back when I was at Red Hat, I had a back when I was at Red Hat, I had a couple customers that specifically asked couple customers that specifically asked couple customers that specifically asked for this, but it wasn't a big request. for this, but it wasn't a big request. for this, but it wasn't a big request. So again, uh you need to understand how So again, uh you need to understand how So again, uh you need to understand how you can do this if you are asked. Um you you can do this if you are asked. Um you you can do this if you are asked. Um you need to have a policy about coordinated need to have a policy about coordinated need to have a policy about coordinated vulnerability disclosure. I hope if vulnerability disclosure. I hope if vulnerability disclosure. I hope if you're here at this conference, you you're here at this conference, you you're here at this conference, you already have that. That should be table already have that. That should be table already have that. That should be table stakes for walking in the mckennon stakes for walking in the mckennon stakes for walking in the mckennon center today. Uh, but if you don't have center today. Uh, but if you don't have center today. Uh, but if you don't have that, that's a pretty easy thing to put that, that's a pretty easy thing to put that, that's a pretty easy thing to put into place what your policy is, how into place what your policy is, how into place what your policy is, how people report vulnerabilities to you, people report vulnerabilities to you, people report vulnerabilities to you, kind of what your timelines and what kind of what your timelines and what kind of what your timelines and what your process is uh, for the your process is uh, for the your process is uh, for the public. And then you want to make sure public. And then you want to make sure public. And then you want to make sure that you have a process of sharing that you have a process of sharing that you have a process of sharing information about potential information about potential information about potential vulnerabilities in your product as well vulnerabilities in your product as well vulnerabilities in your product as well as third-party components. I know some as third-party components. I know some as third-party components. I know some organizations that don't issue organizations that don't issue organizations that don't issue advisories for thirdparty components in advisories for thirdparty components in advisories for thirdparty components in their products. That's going to have to their products. That's going to have to their products. That's going to have to change if you want to sell it in Europe. And again, uh people need to be Europe. And again, uh people need to be Europe. And again, uh people need to be able to you need to have a mailing list, able to you need to have a mailing list, able to you need to have a mailing list, a blog, a website. You need to have a a blog, a website. You need to have a a blog, a website. You need to have a API that people can get access to your API that people can get access to your API that people can get access to your reported your vulnerabilities as they're reported your vulnerabilities as they're reported your vulnerabilities as they're streaming through the pipeline. This is where it gets interesting and This is where it gets interesting and This is where it gets interesting and you probably you probably you probably um are or aren't doing some of these um are or aren't doing some of these um are or aren't doing some of these things. The regulation wants a single things. The regulation wants a single things. The regulation wants a single point of contact for your point of contact for your point of contact for your company within the first community. company within the first community. company within the first community. There are several different flavors of There are several different flavors of There are several different flavors of uh security incident response teams. uh uh security incident response teams. uh uh security incident response teams. uh they don't care that your seesert they don't care that your seesert they don't care that your seesert manages the website and your laptops and manages the website and your laptops and manages the website and your laptops and that the PERT manages the products. They that the PERT manages the products. They that the PERT manages the products. They want a single point of contact that want a single point of contact that want a single point of contact that consumers and the market can engage with consumers and the market can engage with consumers and the market can engage with you uh to ask questions and whatnot. So you uh to ask questions and whatnot. So you uh to ask questions and whatnot. So again, if you have a split cert, you're again, if you have a split cert, you're again, if you have a split cert, you're going to need to figure out a model for going to need to figure out a model for going to need to figure out a model for how tickets get appropriately routed to how tickets get appropriately routed to how tickets get appropriately routed to the right team because in a slide or the right team because in a slide or the right team because in a slide or two, you're going to find out that two, you're going to find out that two, you're going to find out that there's some really harsh timelines put there's some really harsh timelines put there's some really harsh timelines put on you. And um that single point of contact, you And um that single point of contact, you And um that single point of contact, you need to allow uh the consumer to engage need to allow uh the consumer to engage need to allow uh the consumer to engage with you um by their preferred means, with you um by their preferred means, with you um by their preferred means, which again it's kind of another vague which again it's kind of another vague which again it's kind of another vague term, but that could be a phone call, it term, but that could be a phone call, it term, but that could be a phone call, it could be an email, it could be a web could be an email, it could be a web could be an email, it could be a web form. Here a pigeon. So you need to be form. Here a pigeon. So you need to be form. Here a pigeon. So you need to be able to if somebody's trying to able to if somebody's trying to able to if somebody's trying to communicate with you, you need to be communicate with you, you need to be communicate with you, you need to be able to ingest that particular request. able to ingest that particular request. able to ingest that particular request. And that's why today it'd be a great And that's why today it'd be a great And that's why today it'd be a great idea to start to train your customers. idea to start to train your customers. idea to start to train your customers. Securityblah.com is how you email us, Securityblah.com is how you email us, Securityblah.com is how you email us, start training folks that that's how you start training folks that that's how you start training folks that that's how you would like the process to would like the process to would like the process to go. Uh you will notify go. Uh you will notify go. Uh you will notify uh a national and ina if you are aware uh a national and ina if you are aware uh a national and ina if you are aware of any actively exploited of any actively exploited of any actively exploited vulnerabilities. I don't know a lot of vulnerabilities. I don't know a lot of vulnerabilities. I don't know a lot of PERTs today that are actively seeking PERTs today that are actively seeking PERTs today that are actively seeking out exploited information. You might not out exploited information. You might not out exploited information. You might not have a threat hunting team or have a threat hunting team or have a threat hunting team or capability. You will need to uh be aware capability. You will need to uh be aware capability. You will need to uh be aware of that and as potential problems and of that and as potential problems and of that and as potential problems and vulnerabilities are found, you're going vulnerabilities are found, you're going vulnerabilities are found, you're going to need to share that uh through to need to share that uh through to need to share that uh through something they're calling the single something they're calling the single something they're calling the single reporting platform. We'll talk about reporting platform. We'll talk about reporting platform. We'll talk about that in a that in a that in a second. Uh this is another eye chart, second. Uh this is another eye chart, second. Uh this is another eye chart, but this is the timelines. So if you are but this is the timelines. So if you are but this is the timelines. So if you are aware of an actively exploited aware of an actively exploited aware of an actively exploited vulnerability, you have 24 vulnerability, you have 24 vulnerability, you have 24 hours 24 hours 24 hours 24 hours to notify ina and a national hours to notify ina and a national hours to notify ina and a national seaert over in seaert over in seaert over in Europe. That is the law, my friends. You Europe. That is the law, my friends. You Europe. That is the law, my friends. You may or may not have the ability to do may or may not have the ability to do may or may not have the ability to do that today. I encourage you to run out that today. I encourage you to run out that today. I encourage you to run out of the McKinnon Center after our day of of the McKinnon Center after our day of of the McKinnon Center after our day of CRA talks and figure out how you'll be CRA talks and figure out how you'll be CRA talks and figure out how you'll be able to do this. able to do this. able to do this. My personal feeling, and I haven't My personal feeling, and I haven't My personal feeling, and I haven't talked with the commission or anybody talked with the commission or anybody talked with the commission or anybody yet, but I think something like VEX, yet, but I think something like VEX, yet, but I think something like VEX, this is under investigation, this is under investigation, this is under investigation, um that may be sufficient for the um that may be sufficient for the um that may be sufficient for the 24-hour notice, might not. Uh we'll see. 24-hour notice, might not. Uh we'll see. 24-hour notice, might not. Uh we'll see. And then uh you will provide essentially And then uh you will provide essentially And then uh you will provide essentially a security advisory, a vulnerability a security advisory, a vulnerability a security advisory, a vulnerability notification within 72 hours that you're notification within 72 hours that you're notification within 72 hours that you're aware of this being actively exploited aware of this being actively exploited aware of this being actively exploited and you will either provide a patch or a and you will either provide a patch or a and you will either provide a patch or a workaround for workaround for workaround for customers within 72 customers within 72 customers within 72 hours. And then you need to have a final hours. And then you need to have a final hours. And then you need to have a final report uh 14 days after the uh initial report uh 14 days after the uh initial report uh 14 days after the uh initial awareness of this particular thing. Right. And there was a point there are Right. And there was a point there are Right. And there was a point there are parts of the law that go into effect. parts of the law that go into effect. parts of the law that go into effect. Um, can you repeat that? Is I'm going to Um, can you repeat that? Is I'm going to Um, can you repeat that? Is I'm going to paraphrase. Um, there are certain parts paraphrase. Um, there are certain parts paraphrase. Um, there are certain parts of the law that go into effect um, 2026, of the law that go into effect um, 2026, of the law that go into effect um, 2026, I believe October, September 2026, and I believe October, September 2026, and I believe October, September 2026, and it's around the vulnerability reporting. it's around the vulnerability reporting. it's around the vulnerability reporting. So, you have less time to get prepared So, you have less time to get prepared So, you have less time to get prepared for these pieces I'm going to talk about for these pieces I'm going to talk about for these pieces I'm going to talk about now. Accurate paraphrase. Excellent. How do they define actively exploited? How do they define actively exploited? How do they define actively exploited? Yes. Lovely. Thank you. Lovely. Thank you. Lovely. Thank you. Uh this is something we're all working Uh this is something we're all working Uh this is something we're all working out together. Um a lot of these items out together. Um a lot of these items out together. Um a lot of these items are again being um debated and discussed are again being um debated and discussed are again being um debated and discussed whether it's with the commission or the whether it's with the commission or the whether it's with the commission or the the standardization bodies. Um so we the standardization bodies. Um so we the standardization bodies. Um so we will get more will get more will get more information about what they want and information about what they want and information about what they want and kind of um how to implement this kind of um how to implement this kind of um how to implement this particular capability but it's better to particular capability but it's better to particular capability but it's better to have something today that you tweak than have something today that you tweak than have something today that you tweak than trying to create this from scratch uh trying to create this from scratch uh trying to create this from scratch uh August 2026. Mr. Burcell again you may August 2026. Mr. Burcell again you may August 2026. Mr. Burcell again you may be coming to it but I believe that there be coming to it but I believe that there be coming to it but I believe that there is provision for embargos is provision for embargos is provision for embargos uh in certain circumstances. Is that uh in certain circumstances. Is that uh in certain circumstances. Is that correct? Yes. Um there is the ability to correct? Yes. Um there is the ability to correct? Yes. Um there is the ability to um have embargos. Uh the language there um have embargos. Uh the language there um have embargos. Uh the language there is kind of light. Um but that refers is kind of light. Um but that refers is kind of light. Um but that refers more to uh your kind of mom and apple more to uh your kind of mom and apple more to uh your kind of mom and apple pie regular vulnerabilities not these pie regular vulnerabilities not these pie regular vulnerabilities not these actively exploited. You know this is actively exploited. You know this is actively exploited. You know this is something that there's you know you have something that there's you know you have something that there's you know you have evidence that there's a cyber breach evidence that there's a cyber breach evidence that there's a cyber breach that you're cut people are being victims that you're cut people are being victims that you're cut people are being victims of ransomware or DOS and whatnot. Now, the other thing that's going to get Now, the other thing that's going to get Now, the other thing that's going to get you all a little itchy, the other piece you all a little itchy, the other piece you all a little itchy, the other piece around vulnerability reporting is you around vulnerability reporting is you around vulnerability reporting is you shall notify of any severe incident shall notify of any severe incident shall notify of any severe incident having an impact of the security of your having an impact of the security of your having an impact of the security of your product and that notification goes to product and that notification goes to product and that notification goes to both ENISA and a national cess which I both ENISA and a national cess which I both ENISA and a national cess which I will talk about in a slide or two. So, will talk about in a slide or two. So, will talk about in a slide or two. So, this is your traditional vulnerability this is your traditional vulnerability this is your traditional vulnerability response. response. response. Hopefully, you all are doing this Hopefully, you all are doing this Hopefully, you all are doing this today. You're probably not going to like today. You're probably not going to like today. You're probably not going to like the time the time the time frames. Uh so for your regular frames. Uh so for your regular frames. Uh so for your regular vulnerabilities, you are expected to vulnerabilities, you are expected to vulnerabilities, you are expected to provide a early warning of a severe provide a early warning of a severe provide a early warning of a severe incident which my reading of that it incident which my reading of that it incident which my reading of that it states um any vulnerability that affects states um any vulnerability that affects states um any vulnerability that affects the confidentiality, integrity, and the confidentiality, integrity, and the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of a availability of a availability of a product. And my personal interpretation product. And my personal interpretation product. And my personal interpretation is that is essentially every is that is essentially every is that is essentially every vulnerability because you don't have a vulnerability because you don't have a vulnerability because you don't have a vulnerability if it doesn't impact vulnerability if it doesn't impact vulnerability if it doesn't impact CIA. Hopefully we'll get some clarity CIA. Hopefully we'll get some clarity CIA. Hopefully we'll get some clarity around this phrase, but basically you around this phrase, but basically you around this phrase, but basically you have 24 hours to submit this early have 24 hours to submit this early have 24 hours to submit this early notification that we are aware of a notification that we are aware of a notification that we are aware of a vulnerability. Uh then essentially you vulnerability. Uh then essentially you vulnerability. Uh then essentially you have 72 hours to uh have more have 72 hours to uh have more have 72 hours to uh have more information. Get you in a second, Abby. information. Get you in a second, Abby. information. Get you in a second, Abby. You'll have 20 72 hours to provide more You'll have 20 72 hours to provide more You'll have 20 72 hours to provide more information. Um, ideally workarounds or information. Um, ideally workarounds or information. Um, ideally workarounds or preferred preferred preferred patches. 72 hours. And then you have a patches. 72 hours. And then you have a patches. 72 hours. And then you have a final report that's due to Ena and final report that's due to Ena and final report that's due to Ena and everybody. And I think that was a month everybody. And I think that was a month everybody. And I think that was a month afterwards. Abby afterwards. Abby afterwards. Abby Chris. So, um, I think a little closer Chris. So, um, I think a little closer Chris. So, um, I think a little closer to the mic, please. I think you might to the mic, please. I think you might to the mic, please. I think you might have answered it, but um for the 72-hour have answered it, but um for the 72-hour have answered it, but um for the 72-hour notification, are they expecting a plan notification, are they expecting a plan notification, are they expecting a plan or to have the patches in effect? or to have the patches in effect? or to have the patches in effect? Yes. Yes. Yes. Uh the text essenti as again I'm not Uh the text essenti as again I'm not Uh the text essenti as again I'm not your lawyer. As I read it, it appears as your lawyer. As I read it, it appears as your lawyer. As I read it, it appears as if uh you could be able to uh publish an if uh you could be able to uh publish an if uh you could be able to uh publish an advisory stating this is what the advisory stating this is what the advisory stating this is what the problem is and talk about workarounds. I problem is and talk about workarounds. I problem is and talk about workarounds. I believe they are going to desire the believe they are going to desire the believe they are going to desire the fixes. Um I don't know that they are fixes. Um I don't know that they are fixes. Um I don't know that they are going to require that and again that's going to require that and again that's going to require that and again that's uh this will be ironed out as we engage uh this will be ironed out as we engage uh this will be ironed out as we engage with the the commissions and Zelac Etsy with the the commissions and Zelac Etsy with the the commissions and Zelac Etsy and Nissa and everybody. Thank you. and Nissa and everybody. Thank you. and Nissa and everybody. Thank you. You're welcome. So again you are You're welcome. So again you are You're welcome. So again you are probably doing this today. You will need probably doing this today. You will need probably doing this today. You will need to do it faster and if you rely on to do it faster and if you rely on to do it faster and if you rely on upstream open source for some of these upstream open source for some of these upstream open source for some of these vulnerability fixes if you don't do all vulnerability fixes if you don't do all vulnerability fixes if you don't do all the engineering yourself. Uh I know very the engineering yourself. Uh I know very the engineering yourself. Uh I know very few projects that are happy in turning few projects that are happy in turning few projects that are happy in turning around a patch upstream within 72 hours. around a patch upstream within 72 hours. around a patch upstream within 72 hours. And again the developer isn't obliged to And again the developer isn't obliged to And again the developer isn't obliged to do that. You all are. So how are you do that. You all are. So how are you do that. You all are. So how are you going to solve this problem with your going to solve this problem with your going to solve this problem with your supply chain and this is where uh the severe chain and this is where uh the severe chain and this is where uh the severe incident. So an incident that has impact incident. So an incident that has impact incident. So an incident that has impact on the security of the product is on the security of the product is on the security of the product is considered severe when it negatively considered severe when it negatively considered severe when it negatively affects or is capable of negatively affects or is capable of negatively affects or is capable of negatively affecting the ability of the product to affecting the ability of the product to affecting the ability of the product to protect availability, authenticity, protect availability, authenticity, protect availability, authenticity, integrity, confidentiality of sensitive integrity, confidentiality of sensitive integrity, confidentiality of sensitive or important data. So essentially if or important data. So essentially if or important data. So essentially if it's touches on personal data, it's touches on personal data, it's touches on personal data, healthcare data, anything uh data e, healthcare data, anything uh data e, healthcare data, anything uh data e, it's considered severe. So that you're it's considered severe. So that you're it's considered severe. So that you're off to the races and you must you got off to the races and you must you got off to the races and you must you got that 72 hours to get that fixed that 72 hours to get that fixed that 72 hours to get that fixed together. Now they talk about a seert together. Now they talk about a seert together. Now they talk about a seert uh many of the organizations I've worked uh many of the organizations I've worked uh many of the organizations I've worked with h are incorporated within the with h are incorporated within the with h are incorporated within the union. So you might have an office in union. So you might have an office in union. So you might have an office in Germany or France or Spain or wherever Germany or France or Spain or wherever Germany or France or Spain or wherever that might be. So this will be easy for that might be. So this will be easy for that might be. So this will be easy for you to decide. But if you don't have you to decide. But if you don't have you to decide. But if you don't have offices uh within the 27 nations in the offices uh within the 27 nations in the offices uh within the 27 nations in the union, you're going to need to pick a union, you're going to need to pick a union, you're going to need to pick a national seaert as a national seaert as a national seaert as a buddy. And you you could pick the buddy. And you you could pick the buddy. And you you could pick the Nordicert, you could pick BSI. Uh Nordicert, you could pick BSI. Uh Nordicert, you could pick BSI. Uh there's a lot of choices and they give there's a lot of choices and they give there's a lot of choices and they give you a little uh you a little uh you a little uh algorithm so to speak. U article 14 item algorithm so to speak. U article 14 item algorithm so to speak. U article 14 item 7 talks about if you don't have a office 7 talks about if you don't have a office 7 talks about if you don't have a office in Europe which would probably be the in Europe which would probably be the in Europe which would probably be the default I'm going to that's how I'll default I'm going to that's how I'll default I'm going to that's how I'll that's the piece the cert I'll work with that's the piece the cert I'll work with that's the piece the cert I'll work with if you don't have that today they give if you don't have that today they give if you don't have that today they give you a little matrix of how to figure you a little matrix of how to figure you a little matrix of how to figure that out. Uh and it's based off of you that out. Uh and it's based off of you that out. Uh and it's based off of you need to know like where what country you need to know like where what country you need to know like where what country you sell the most product in. So that'll sell the most product in. So that'll sell the most product in. So that'll probably be the place that you want to probably be the place that you want to probably be the place that you want to establish that relationship with the establish that relationship with the establish that relationship with the national. Um, but they they they talk national. Um, but they they they talk national. Um, but they they they talk about this. So, that's article 14, item about this. So, that's article 14, item about this. So, that's article 14, item 7. So, please uh read that and get that 7. So, please uh read that and get that 7. So, please uh read that and get that figured out. And that's probably before figured out. And that's probably before figured out. And that's probably before the uh 2026 date. You'll need to have the uh 2026 date. You'll need to have the uh 2026 date. You'll need to have that figured that figured that figured out. Uh la. So, when you're aware of a out. Uh la. So, when you're aware of a out. Uh la. So, when you're aware of a vulnerability that's being actively vulnerability that's being actively vulnerability that's being actively exploited, you are obliged to inform the exploited, you are obliged to inform the exploited, you are obliged to inform the impacted impacted impacted users. No definition on that. That could users. No definition on that. That could users. No definition on that. That could be an advisory, could be an email, could be an advisory, could be an email, could be an advisory, could be an email, could be a blog. You'll need to figure this be a blog. You'll need to figure this be a blog. You'll need to figure this out. You're probably doing this today. out. You're probably doing this today. out. You're probably doing this today. And what is nine telling me? Um, and that they mention here in in me? Um, and that they mention here in in me? Um, and that they mention here in in article 14, item nine, that they will article 14, item nine, that they will article 14, item nine, that they will continue to amend certain pieces of the continue to amend certain pieces of the continue to amend certain pieces of the legislation. So, the core of it is done. legislation. So, the core of it is done. legislation. So, the core of it is done. it's locked in but there will be it's locked in but there will be it's locked in but there will be additional additional additional clarification and uh refinement and clarification and uh refinement and clarification and uh refinement and pointing out to ways to implement the pointing out to ways to implement the pointing out to ways to implement the desired outcomes they desired outcomes they desired outcomes they want. All right. They talk about uh want. All right. They talk about uh want. All right. They talk about uh providing a secure way to distribute providing a secure way to distribute providing a secure way to distribute your updates. So you need to be able to your updates. So you need to be able to your updates. So you need to be able to uh have https TLS whatever you know you uh have https TLS whatever you know you uh have https TLS whatever you know you need to provide your updates uh securely need to provide your updates uh securely need to provide your updates uh securely so they can be verified to be so they can be verified to be so they can be verified to be untampered. And then annex 1.8 is that untampered. And then annex 1.8 is that untampered. And then annex 1.8 is that you will issue the security fixes you will issue the security fixes you will issue the security fixes without delay and free of charge. Woo. And that is broadly the law. It's Woo. And that is broadly the law. It's Woo. And that is broadly the law. It's not all doom and gloom. I have some not all doom and gloom. I have some not all doom and gloom. I have some advice from you. I'm probe. I'm from the advice from you. I'm probe. I'm from the advice from you. I'm probe. I'm from the open source. I'm here to help. Uh open source. I'm here to help.

Um we just recently the Linux Foundation Um we just recently the Linux Foundation Um we just recently the Linux Foundation released two research reports. Uh one is released two research reports. Uh one is released two research reports. Uh one is terrible news. The other is good news. terrible news. The other is good news. terrible news. The other is good news. The terrible news the unaware and The terrible news the unaware and The terrible news the unaware and uncertain report. We surveyed 600 open uncertain report. We surveyed 600 open uncertain report. We surveyed 600 open source maintainers, projects and source maintainers, projects and source maintainers, projects and manufacturers and we got some uh manufacturers and we got some uh manufacturers and we got some uh terrible news that many people that terrible news that many people that terrible news that many people that should be aware and taking steps are should be aware and taking steps are should be aware and taking steps are not. not. not. uh so uh upstream and people that uh so uh upstream and people that uh so uh upstream and people that upstream adjacent aren't necessarily upstream adjacent aren't necessarily upstream adjacent aren't necessarily ready to help you yet. But then we did a ready to help you yet. But then we did a ready to help you yet. But then we did a second report uh pathways to cyber second report uh pathways to cyber second report uh pathways to cyber security best practices and open source security best practices and open source security best practices and open source where we cite three upstream projects where we cite three upstream projects where we cite three upstream projects that today are fulfilling significant that today are fulfilling significant that today are fulfilling significant obligations within the CRA. So obligations within the CRA. So obligations within the CRA. So leveraging projects like these or leveraging projects like these or leveraging projects like these or adopting their methodologies will be adopting their methodologies will be adopting their methodologies will be useful both for a manufacturer but also useful both for a manufacturer but also useful both for a manufacturer but also other open source projects. So, those other open source projects. So, those other open source projects. So, those are both uh freely are both uh freely are both uh freely available. Uh this was the worst stat available. Uh this was the worst stat available. Uh this was the worst stat that made me so sad. Uh 62% of the that made me so sad. Uh 62% of the that made me so sad. Uh 62% of the people out of the 600 people we surveyed people out of the 600 people we surveyed people out of the 600 people we surveyed were either not familiar at all or were were either not familiar at all or were were either not familiar at all or were only slightly familiar with the CRA. And only slightly familiar with the CRA. And only slightly familiar with the CRA. And uh it was an abysmal figure that uh it was an abysmal figure that uh it was an abysmal figure that understood the December 2027 date. So understood the December 2027 date. So understood the December 2027 date. So again, if you take nothing else away again, if you take nothing else away again, if you take nothing else away from Volcon, a lot of great stuff. from Volcon, a lot of great stuff. from Volcon, a lot of great stuff. understand what the dates are for you if understand what the dates are for you if understand what the dates are for you if you sell into Europe to European you sell into Europe to European you sell into Europe to European citizens. Uh the Linux Foundation has citizens. Uh the Linux Foundation has citizens. Uh the Linux Foundation has created a CRA 101 class. The materials created a CRA 101 class. The materials created a CRA 101 class. The materials are publicly available today in our are publicly available today in our are publicly available today in our GitHub repo and the course should go GitHub repo and the course should go GitHub repo and the course should go online probably in about a week. Yeah. online probably in about a week. Yeah. online probably in about a week. Yeah. So, it's a free class and if you want to So, it's a free class and if you want to So, it's a free class and if you want to learn more about the legislation, uh we learn more about the legislation, uh we learn more about the legislation, uh we have a free class for you. It'll be um have a free class for you. It'll be um have a free class for you. It'll be um on LF education. It'll be LF01 and we're working on I'm writing a LF01 and we're working on I'm writing a LF01 and we're working on I'm writing a class right now how to do a risk class right now how to do a risk class right now how to do a risk assessment per the Anissa risk assessment per the Anissa risk assessment per the Anissa risk management methodology. So if you would management methodology. So if you would management methodology. So if you would like to pick that up um that'll probably like to pick that up um that'll probably like to pick that up um that'll probably come out summer. I haven't had time to come out summer. I haven't had time to come out summer. I haven't had time to start it yet because I have too damn start it yet because I have too damn start it yet because I have too damn many CRA many CRA many CRA meetings. Uh we also have a project meetings. Uh we also have a project meetings. Uh we also have a project called the security baseline. We looked called the security baseline. We looked called the security baseline. We looked at uh 41 cyber security uh either laws at uh 41 cyber security uh either laws at uh 41 cyber security uh either laws or compliance controls and these are or compliance controls and these are or compliance controls and these are good practices we think that upstream good practices we think that upstream good practices we think that upstream could adopt and downstream absolutely could adopt and downstream absolutely could adopt and downstream absolutely should be doing. So we have eight should be doing. So we have eight should be doing. So we have eight categories. It looks at things like categories. It looks at things like categories. It looks at things like access control, your build and release access control, your build and release access control, your build and release system, documentation, governance, system, documentation, governance, system, documentation, governance, legal, which is predominantly licensing, legal, which is predominantly licensing, legal, which is predominantly licensing, uh quality assurance, which is testing, uh quality assurance, which is testing, uh quality assurance, which is testing, security assessment, and vulnerability security assessment, and vulnerability security assessment, and vulnerability management. This is organized by three management. This is organized by three management. This is organized by three levels of maturity. So, we feel and levels of maturity. So, we feel and levels of maturity. So, we feel and through our pilot program, we've have through our pilot program, we've have through our pilot program, we've have gotten feedback from actual open source gotten feedback from actual open source gotten feedback from actual open source maintainers that level one should be maintainers that level one should be maintainers that level one should be attainable by a single person project. attainable by a single person project. attainable by a single person project. So somebody on their own that wanted to, So somebody on their own that wanted to, So somebody on their own that wanted to, you know, do the right thing could do you know, do the right thing could do you know, do the right thing could do this. But if we had some downstream this. But if we had some downstream this. But if we had some downstream help, you know, somebody that was a help, you know, somebody that was a help, you know, somebody that was a critical uh downstream that, you know, critical uh downstream that, you know, critical uh downstream that, you know, felt that this software was great, it's felt that this software was great, it's felt that this software was great, it's an opportunity for you all to step in an opportunity for you all to step in an opportunity for you all to step in and help instantiate these processes and and help instantiate these processes and and help instantiate these processes and artifacts into the software that you artifacts into the software that you artifacts into the software that you know and love. know and love. know and love. uh I've created a compliance crosswalk uh I've created a compliance crosswalk uh I've created a compliance crosswalk where I have looked at several legal uh where I have looked at several legal uh where I have looked at several legal uh regimes and several well-known cyber regimes and several well-known cyber regimes and several well-known cyber security frameworks like the uh NIST security frameworks like the uh NIST security frameworks like the uh NIST cyber security framework, the SSDF. I cyber security framework, the SSDF. I cyber security framework, the SSDF. I have lined this up against the CRA NX1 have lined this up against the CRA NX1 have lined this up against the CRA NX1 and if you follow the baseline, you will and if you follow the baseline, you will and if you follow the baseline, you will be able to fulfill 19 of the 21 items be able to fulfill 19 of the 21 items be able to fulfill 19 of the 21 items within NX1. The only things we don't within NX1. The only things we don't within NX1. The only things we don't cover upstream would be uh managing uh cover upstream would be uh managing uh cover upstream would be uh managing uh sensitive data PII type stuff and then u sensitive data PII type stuff and then u sensitive data PII type stuff and then u rem the ability giving the ability for a rem the ability giving the ability for a rem the ability giving the ability for a consumer to remove their data from your consumer to remove their data from your consumer to remove their data from your system. That's not something that again system. That's not something that again system. That's not something that again upstream generally doesn't interact with upstream generally doesn't interact with upstream generally doesn't interact with this stuff. We write the source code. this stuff. We write the source code. this stuff. We write the source code. You all are producing the product that You all are producing the product that You all are producing the product that delivers that functionality. delivers that functionality. delivers that functionality. Uh but yeah, so if if you followed all Uh but yeah, so if if you followed all Uh but yeah, so if if you followed all the baseline criteria, you should be the baseline criteria, you should be the baseline criteria, you should be able you have very good ground to stand able you have very good ground to stand able you have very good ground to stand on to defend yourself against the market on to defend yourself against the market on to defend yourself against the market surveillance authorities or auditors. surveillance authorities or auditors. surveillance authorities or auditors. And we are in flight right now to And we are in flight right now to And we are in flight right now to uh start automating this. So there will uh start automating this. So there will uh start automating this. So there will be a tool that you run this baseline be a tool that you run this baseline be a tool that you run this baseline checker against a software repository. checker against a software repository. checker against a software repository. it will identify you know where you are it will identify you know where you are it will identify you know where you are or aren't compliant and then it will or aren't compliant and then it will or aren't compliant and then it will helpfully file a PR for the project to helpfully file a PR for the project to helpfully file a PR for the project to be able to uh implement those changes be able to uh implement those changes be able to uh implement those changes and a lot of it's documentation do you and a lot of it's documentation do you and a lot of it's documentation do you have a process um you know how do you uh have a process um you know how do you uh have a process um you know how do you uh vet maintainers coming in that type of vet maintainers coming in that type of vet maintainers coming in that type of stuff and this again this is my primary stuff and this again this is my primary stuff and this again this is my primary stakeholder with the baseline is stakeholder with the baseline is stakeholder with the baseline is upstream open source but then my upstream open source but then my upstream open source but then my secondary persona I care about are secondary persona I care about are secondary persona I care about are downstream manufacturers so these are downstream manufacturers so these are downstream manufacturers so these are rules requirements based in frameworks rules requirements based in frameworks rules requirements based in frameworks you're probably already using you're probably already using you're probably already using today. And this is, you know, upstream today. And this is, you know, upstream today. And this is, you know, upstream helping downstream helping upstream to helping downstream helping upstream to helping downstream helping upstream to do more. So again, if you look at annex do more. So again, if you look at annex do more. So again, if you look at annex one and you look at the baseline or you one and you look at the baseline or you one and you look at the baseline or you have your own checklist, I encourage you have your own checklist, I encourage you have your own checklist, I encourage you again after you run off and figure out again after you run off and figure out again after you run off and figure out how you're going to do the reporting at how you're going to do the reporting at how you're going to do the reporting at the end of the day and how you're going the end of the day and how you're going the end of the day and how you're going to who's your national seaert buddy. you to who's your national seaert buddy. you to who's your national seaert buddy. you should start to figure out how you're should start to figure out how you're should start to figure out how you're going to start to assist the critical going to start to assist the critical going to start to assist the critical upstream open source projects you upstream open source projects you upstream open source projects you consume. There is a ton of information consume. There is a ton of information consume. There is a ton of information available on the internet whether you're available on the internet whether you're available on the internet whether you're going to the CRA portal, there's a going to the CRA portal, there's a going to the CRA portal, there's a expert group that several of us in the expert group that several of us in the expert group that several of us in the room participate in. Uh there's room participate in. Uh there's room participate in. Uh there's anes I really like the documentation anes I really like the documentation anes I really like the documentation from BSI. I think they do a really good from BSI. I think they do a really good from BSI. I think they do a really good job. So that's a nice model to look at. job. So that's a nice model to look at. job. So that's a nice model to look at. uh actual implementation guidance before uh actual implementation guidance before uh actual implementation guidance before we get the standardization worked out. we get the standardization worked out. we get the standardization worked out. Um we have a working group where we talk Um we have a working group where we talk Um we have a working group where we talk about global regulation. Today it's about global regulation. Today it's about global regulation. Today it's mostly about the CRA but we also will mostly about the CRA but we also will mostly about the CRA but we also will talk about US or Chinese or Indian or talk about US or Chinese or Indian or talk about US or Chinese or Indian or British laws. Uh we have a public policy British laws. Uh we have a public policy British laws. Uh we have a public policy committee. We have a whole website committee. We have a whole website committee. We have a whole website focused in on what my group is doing. focused in on what my group is doing. focused in on what my group is doing. But there are a lot of other groups like But there are a lot of other groups like But there are a lot of other groups like the Eclipse Orc working group. They have the Eclipse Orc working group. They have the Eclipse Orc working group. They have a ton of information available out a ton of information available out a ton of information available out there. So don't be unaware and there. So don't be unaware and there. So don't be unaware and uncertain. There are ways for you to get uncertain. There are ways for you to get uncertain. There are ways for you to get the information you need to be compliant. That's all I have prepared. compliant. That's all I have prepared. compliant. That's all I have prepared. What additional questions? Um I think I What additional questions? Um I think I What additional questions? Um I think I have some tissues up here if you have a have some tissues up here if you have a have some tissues up here if you have a cry. Uh what what can we anything else cry. Uh what what can we anything else cry. Uh what what can we anything else you want to know more you want to know more you want to know more about or ask the room? And this isn't all the CRA room? And this isn't all the CRA room? And this isn't all the CRA obligations. This is just PER. There's a obligations. This is just PER. There's a obligations. This is just PER. There's a bunch of other stuff your company needs bunch of other stuff your company needs bunch of other stuff your company needs to be doing outside of that. On the on to be doing outside of that. On the on to be doing outside of that. On the on the previous page, you had some really the previous page, you had some really the previous page, you had some really good references and things. Presumably, good references and things. Presumably, good references and things. Presumably, all of those different groups agree on all of those different groups agree on all of those different groups agree on everything. You're killing me, Burcell. Uh, fun You're killing me, Burcell. Uh, fun You're killing me, Burcell. Uh, fun fact, there is no such thing as the open fact, there is no such thing as the open fact, there is no such thing as the open source. uh getting two developers to source. uh getting two developers to source. uh getting two developers to agree on anything is a challenge at best agree on anything is a challenge at best agree on anything is a challenge at best of times. So there are a couple of times. So there are a couple of times. So there are a couple different groups working to solve this different groups working to solve this different groups working to solve this problem within their kind of domain of problem within their kind of domain of problem within their kind of domain of expertise. We do talk um a lot of the expertise. We do talk um a lot of the expertise. We do talk um a lot of the foundations today talk and I would foundations today talk and I would foundations today talk and I would encourage you all to go reach out to if encourage you all to go reach out to if encourage you all to go reach out to if you're a member of any of these you're a member of any of these you're a member of any of these organizations talk with them find out organizations talk with them find out organizations talk with them find out what your affiliate organization is what your affiliate organization is what your affiliate organization is doing and how you can contribute and doing and how you can contribute and doing and how you can contribute and help them help all of help them help all of help them help all of you. Oh yeah, stay tuned. The gentleman you. Oh yeah, stay tuned. The gentleman you. Oh yeah, stay tuned. The gentleman in the handsome lavender waste coat has in the handsome lavender waste coat has in the handsome lavender waste coat has some assistance in that particular area some assistance in that particular area some assistance in that particular area coming later. Mr. Bohannan. Thanks coming later. Mr. Bohannan. Thanks coming later. Mr. Bohannan. Thanks again. My name is Mark Bohannan. uh again. My name is Mark Bohannan. uh again. My name is Mark Bohannan. uh worked with Cro at Red Hat. Actually, I worked with Cro at Red Hat. Actually, I worked with Cro at Red Hat. Actually, I was actually his lawyer and played the was actually his lawyer and played the was actually his lawyer and played the role of telling what he could and could role of telling what he could and could role of telling what he could and could not say, right? Uh I thought I might not say, right? Uh I thought I might not say, right? Uh I thought I might just offer my own perspective on a just offer my own perspective on a just offer my own perspective on a couple of things. He did very well, couple of things. He did very well, couple of things. He did very well, quote, thank you. No, and you're free quote, thank you. No, and you're free quote, thank you. No, and you're free given the reversed roles now to tell me given the reversed roles now to tell me given the reversed roles now to tell me I'm full of it at this point, but I I'm full of it at this point, but I I'm full of it at this point, but I think there are a couple things that think there are a couple things that think there are a couple things that would be helpful for people to get in would be helpful for people to get in would be helpful for people to get in their heads about this. K made reference their heads about this. K made reference their heads about this. K made reference that this is a consumer protection that this is a consumer protection that this is a consumer protection initiative. It is not a security initiative. It is not a security initiative. It is not a security initiative. And you got to get your head initiative. And you got to get your head initiative. And you got to get your head around fact that the model of this is around fact that the model of this is around fact that the model of this is that ultimately what you're going to that ultimately what you're going to that ultimately what you're going to have to have is the oldfashioned CE mark have to have is the oldfashioned CE mark have to have is the oldfashioned CE mark on your product. Yep. For those of you on your product. Yep. For those of you on your product. Yep. For those of you who don't know what the CE mark is, uh who don't know what the CE mark is, uh who don't know what the CE mark is, uh think about your toaster. Okay. And on think about your toaster. Okay. And on think about your toaster. Okay. And on the back of it, there are all these uh the back of it, there are all these uh the back of it, there are all these uh Underwriters Laboratory CE marks that Underwriters Laboratory CE marks that Underwriters Laboratory CE marks that they have conformed. They are taking a they have conformed. They are taking a they have conformed. They are taking a framework that was developed for framework that was developed for framework that was developed for physical products particularly for physical products particularly for physical products particularly for consumers and now applying it to consumers and now applying it to consumers and now applying it to products with digital elements. I say products with digital elements. I say products with digital elements. I say that because that because that because uh the thing one thing that and I uh the thing one thing that and I uh the thing one thing that and I encourage you to incorporate this get encourage you to incorporate this get encourage you to incorporate this get your head around these class one and your head around these class one and your head around these class one and class two products. If there's one thing class two products. If there's one thing class two products. If there's one thing Yeah. that you take away, know which Yeah. that you take away, know which Yeah. that you take away, know which class you're in because the hill you class you're in because the hill you class you're in because the hill you have to climb will either be 4550 degree have to climb will either be 4550 degree have to climb will either be 4550 degree angle or a direct 90deree angle. If angle or a direct 90deree angle. If angle or a direct 90deree angle. If you're class you're class you're class one, you will simply have simp I say one, you will simply have simp I say one, you will simply have simp I say simply you will have to only simply you will have to only simply you will have to only attest subject to uh you know fraud and attest subject to uh you know fraud and attest subject to uh you know fraud and everything else to a provider of a CE everything else to a provider of a CE everything else to a provider of a CE mark to say you can get it. The class mark to say you can get it. The class mark to say you can get it. The class two are going to have to do that with a two are going to have to do that with a two are going to have to do that with a third-party validation. third-party validation. third-party validation. fake common criteria on steroids. fake common criteria on steroids. fake common criteria on steroids. If those of you in the telecom industry, If those of you in the telecom industry, If those of you in the telecom industry, if you remember the old electromagnetic if you remember the old electromagnetic if you remember the old electromagnetic compatibility that took 15 years to try compatibility that took 15 years to try compatibility that took 15 years to try to work out, they're trying to do what to work out, they're trying to do what to work out, they're trying to do what took 15 years in the EMC and do it in took 15 years in the EMC and do it in took 15 years in the EMC and do it in two years. So, the testing is not two years. So, the testing is not two years. So, the testing is not necessarily going to be by the entities necessarily going to be by the entities necessarily going to be by the entities you've used compliance testing for like you've used compliance testing for like you've used compliance testing for like BSI or any of those. It's going to be BSI or any of those. It's going to be BSI or any of those. It's going to be the network of third-party evaluators the network of third-party evaluators the network of third-party evaluators that are very politically powerful in that are very politically powerful in that are very politically powerful in Europe that will are authorized to give Europe that will are authorized to give Europe that will are authorized to give the CD part. So I think that's a very the CD part. So I think that's a very the CD part. So I think that's a very important yeah piece particularly if important yeah piece particularly if important yeah piece particularly if you're in a company work with the teams you're in a company work with the teams you're in a company work with the teams that have been doing compliance because that have been doing compliance because that have been doing compliance because they will have a mindset that helps you they will have a mindset that helps you they will have a mindset that helps you technical compliance uh for this. So technical compliance uh for this. So technical compliance uh for this. So otherwise I thought it was very solid otherwise I thought it was very solid otherwise I thought it was very solid great work and we're all trying to great work and we're all trying to great work and we're all trying to figure out what this means and I lived figure out what this means and I lived figure out what this means and I lived it for three or four years. This is not it for three or four years. This is not it for three or four years. This is not suspend suspend suspend logic. Chaos theory is I think the best logic. Chaos theory is I think the best logic. Chaos theory is I think the best tool to understand what is going on with tool to understand what is going on with tool to understand what is going on with the CRA. So thank you. the CRA. So thank you. the CRA. So thank you. Looks like my friend Sarah might have a Looks like my friend Sarah might have a Looks like my friend Sarah might have a question or comment. Can you talk a little bit more about Can you talk a little bit more about Can you talk a little bit more about those expert groups that those expert groups that those expert groups that um are on the learn more? What is an um are on the learn more? What is an um are on the learn more? What is an expert group and who contributes to it? expert group and who contributes to it? expert group and who contributes to it? Uh yes. So there are several uh entities Uh yes. So there are several uh entities Uh yes. So there are several uh entities that are affiliated with this process. that are affiliated with this process. that are affiliated with this process. uh one of the named groups is called the uh one of the named groups is called the uh one of the named groups is called the expert group and this is predominantly expert group and this is predominantly expert group and this is predominantly uh European citizens you know cyber uh European citizens you know cyber uh European citizens you know cyber security experts within the European security experts within the European security experts within the European Union and then a select uh group of uh Union and then a select uh group of uh Union and then a select uh group of uh liaison uh folks like Eclipse and the liaison uh folks like Eclipse and the liaison uh folks like Eclipse and the Linux Foundation are part of this expert Linux Foundation are part of this expert Linux Foundation are part of this expert group and this is where a lot of the group and this is where a lot of the group and this is where a lot of the highlevel kind of conversation and highlevel kind of conversation and highlevel kind of conversation and debate happens ENISA and the commission debate happens ENISA and the commission debate happens ENISA and the commission representatives are there So this is a representatives are there So this is a representatives are there So this is a very influential but very closed group. very influential but very closed group. very influential but very closed group. Um as a US citizen I am allowed to be on Um as a US citizen I am allowed to be on Um as a US citizen I am allowed to be on some of these things and I'm not allowed some of these things and I'm not allowed some of these things and I'm not allowed to be on others. So uh check and see to be on others. So uh check and see to be on others. So uh check and see there are many corporations that are there are many corporations that are there are many corporations that are part of that advisory list or there are part of that advisory list or there are part of that advisory list or there are foundations like Eclipse and uh OpenSSF foundations like Eclipse and uh OpenSSF foundations like Eclipse and uh OpenSSF Linux Foundation that participate. Linux Foundation that participate. Linux Foundation that participate. There's also a group called Senelac There's also a group called Senelac There's also a group called Senelac which does standardization across the which does standardization across the which does standardization across the union. Uh they have uh 41 potential union. Uh they have uh 41 potential union. Uh they have uh 41 potential standards they're discussing and standards they're discussing and standards they're discussing and debating. So that's like you know 41 debating. So that's like you know 41 debating. So that's like you know 41 extra meetings. Yay. Um then there's extra meetings. Yay. Um then there's extra meetings. Yay. Um then there's another group called Etsy which is uh another group called Etsy which is uh another group called Etsy which is uh another kind of standardization entity another kind of standardization entity another kind of standardization entity within the union. And my perception is within the union. And my perception is within the union. And my perception is um Etsy seems a little bit more um Etsy seems a little bit more um Etsy seems a little bit more practical. Um I don't uh I am currently practical. Um I don't uh I am currently practical. Um I don't uh I am currently uh applying to be uh allowed to lies uh applying to be uh allowed to lies uh applying to be uh allowed to lies with both groups. It's a very uh complex with both groups. It's a very uh complex with both groups. It's a very uh complex process. My first application to send process. My first application to send process. My first application to send Senlac was rejected because I didn't Senlac was rejected because I didn't Senlac was rejected because I didn't list off the headquarters of all of our list off the headquarters of all of our list off the headquarters of all of our members in Europe. I just gave them a members in Europe. I just gave them a members in Europe. I just gave them a web page and they didn't like that. So, web page and they didn't like that. So, web page and they didn't like that. So, uh, they're pretty the bar to get in is uh, they're pretty the bar to get in is uh, they're pretty the bar to get in is pretty high. And if you're interested, pretty high. And if you're interested, pretty high. And if you're interested, again, I would encourage you to work again, I would encourage you to work again, I would encourage you to work with entities that are already there. If with entities that are already there. If with entities that are already there. If you already have an industry group or a you already have an industry group or a you already have an industry group or a foundation that you partner with or foundation that you partner with or foundation that you partner with or you're a member of, I would encourage you're a member of, I would encourage you're a member of, I would encourage you to work through those entities you to work through those entities you to work through those entities because the actual application process because the actual application process because the actual application process is a pain. is a pain. is a pain. Yes. Uh, how does this how would Yes. Uh, how does this how would Yes. Uh, how does this how would software as a service scope into this? software as a service scope into this? software as a service scope into this? So how does software as a service uh be So how does software as a service uh be So how does software as a service uh be affected by this? affected by this? affected by this? Well, broadly uh if it is sold to a European consumer uh if it is sold to a European consumer uh if it is sold to a European consumer and it is some type of uh artifact that and it is some type of uh artifact that and it is some type of uh artifact that they work with. So I I mentioned uh you they work with. So I I mentioned uh you they work with. So I I mentioned uh you have an app on a smartphone. You're a have an app on a smartphone. You're a have an app on a smartphone. You're a bank and you give your customers a app bank and you give your customers a app bank and you give your customers a app on the smartphone. So the app on the on the smartphone. So the app on the on the smartphone. So the app on the phone is required to be compliant and phone is required to be compliant and phone is required to be compliant and any infrastructure back in the cloud or any infrastructure back in the cloud or any infrastructure back in the cloud or your data center that supports that is your data center that supports that is your data center that supports that is uh required uh needs to go under the uh required uh needs to go under the uh required uh needs to go under the scrutiny of the law. Now broadly uh scrutiny of the law. Now broadly uh scrutiny of the law. Now broadly uh hyperscalers like Google mail uh that hyperscalers like Google mail uh that hyperscalers like Google mail uh that type of stuff is out of scope. There's a type of stuff is out of scope. There's a type of stuff is out of scope. There's a different law that manages that that different law that manages that that different law that manages that that will take precedence. But uh think about will take precedence. But uh think about will take precedence. But uh think about anything any infrastructure back at the anything any infrastructure back at the anything any infrastructure back at the mothership that supports this consumer mothership that supports this consumer mothership that supports this consumer product that would need to be in scope. product that would need to be in scope. product that would need to be in scope. And then as Mr. Bohannan mentioned And then as Mr. Bohannan mentioned And then as Mr. Bohannan mentioned there's class one and class 2 products there's class one and class 2 products there's class one and class 2 products which the commission is asking for which the commission is asking for which the commission is asking for feedback on right now. So if you have feedback on right now. So if you have feedback on right now. So if you have feelings about the definitions of things feelings about the definitions of things feelings about the definitions of things like what is a router, what is an like what is a router, what is an like what is a router, what is an operating system, the commission is operating system, the commission is operating system, the commission is taking feedback on that and you I and taking feedback on that and you I and taking feedback on that and you I and Eclipse and others are working to Eclipse and others are working to Eclipse and others are working to provide them uh feedback. But again, if provide them uh feedback. But again, if provide them uh feedback. But again, if you fall into that area, you might have you fall into that area, you might have you fall into that area, you might have the easy button to kind of self assess, the easy button to kind of self assess, the easy button to kind of self assess, but you might get the hard path, which but you might get the hard path, which but you might get the hard path, which sucks, which is, you know, the rubber sucks, which is, you know, the rubber sucks, which is, you know, the rubber glove treatment. But again, it's glove treatment. But again, it's glove treatment. But again, it's anything that supports that product back anything that supports that product back anything that supports that product back at the mothership, but not your whole at the mothership, but not your whole at the mothership, but not your whole network. network. network. Consumer, that's the other piece I Consumer, that's the other piece I Consumer, that's the other piece I wanted to poke at is like if you're a wanted to poke at is like if you're a wanted to poke at is like if you're a businessto business sort of SAS businessto business sort of SAS businessto business sort of SAS provider, the businessto business, I provider, the businessto business, I provider, the businessto business, I believe, is covered by another law. So believe, is covered by another law. So believe, is covered by another law. So it is not directly in scope of the CRA. This is CRA. This is CRA. This is not US banking. This US banking. This US banking. This is so is so is so that business. So that's a distinct reality business. So that's a distinct reality business. So that's a distinct reality that you may not have different that's Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And and things like your website art in And and things like your website art in And and things like your website art in scope. Okay. Thank you. You're welcome. scope. Okay. Thank you. You're welcome. scope. Okay. Thank you. You're welcome. We got a question from Discord. Nice. We got a question from Discord. Nice. We got a question from Discord. Nice. I'm going to read it verbatim. Okay. I'm going to read it verbatim. Okay. I'm going to read it verbatim. Okay. OSS. If the original product has OSS. If the original product has OSS. If the original product has vulnerabilities and there are versions vulnerabilities and there are versions vulnerabilities and there are versions available via repackaging, etc. that may available via repackaging, etc. that may available via repackaging, etc. that may be downstream in a supply chain. Is the be downstream in a supply chain. Is the be downstream in a supply chain. Is the entire supply chain considered a single entire supply chain considered a single entire supply chain considered a single entity for the purposes of this law? Uh, entity for the purposes of this law? Uh, entity for the purposes of this law? Uh, no. The entity that sold the good for no. The entity that sold the good for no. The entity that sold the good for money is must be compliant and do money is must be compliant and do money is must be compliant and do effective due diligence on their supply effective due diligence on their supply effective due diligence on their supply chain. So uh if you source a pro so if chain. So uh if you source a pro so if chain. So uh if you source a pro so if you build a server and you get a part you build a server and you get a part you build a server and you get a part from Intel from Intel from Intel uh you sold the product to the consumer uh you sold the product to the consumer uh you sold the product to the consumer and you might get drugged in to the and you might get drugged in to the and you might get drugged in to the conversation but you know it would be conversation but you know it would be conversation but you know it would be the HP or Dell or Lenovo would be the the HP or Dell or Lenovo would be the the HP or Dell or Lenovo would be the the primary entity would be in scope. So the primary entity would be in scope. So the primary entity would be in scope. So it's not your whole supply chain but you it's not your whole supply chain but you it's not your whole supply chain but you need to be doing effective due diligence need to be doing effective due diligence need to be doing effective due diligence to reduce risk as much as possible. to reduce risk as much as possible. to reduce risk as much as possible. That's your obligation. So, you need to That's your obligation. So, you need to That's your obligation. So, you need to be holding your suppliers uh responsible be holding your suppliers uh responsible be holding your suppliers uh responsible and you know have them help you be and you know have them help you be and you know have them help you be compliant. compliant. compliant. So, Jesse mentioned one of my favorite So, Jesse mentioned one of my favorite So, Jesse mentioned one of my favorite examples or counter examples which is examples or counter examples which is examples or counter examples which is about the the banking app. I think it's about the the banking app. I think it's about the the banking app. I think it's worth discussing and I'm I'm not sure I worth discussing and I'm I'm not sure I worth discussing and I'm I'm not sure I stand on it. So, let's say I I I buy stand on it. So, let's say I I I buy stand on it. So, let's say I I I buy flight radar 24 and people use that to flight radar 24 and people use that to flight radar 24 and people use that to track planes, right? I'm clearly buying track planes, right? I'm clearly buying track planes, right? I'm clearly buying a service, right? says that I'm paying a service, right? says that I'm paying a service, right? says that I'm paying for that thing and so that is being made for that thing and so that is being made for that thing and so that is being made available in the EU uh on the market and available in the EU uh on the market and available in the EU uh on the market and therefore clearly the the CRA applies to therefore clearly the the CRA applies to therefore clearly the the CRA applies to it. If I'm a bank, I could say well I'm it. If I'm a bank, I could say well I'm it. If I'm a bank, I could say well I'm making available this application but making available this application but making available this application but you're not paying for the application. you're not paying for the application. you're not paying for the application. Um I have a service which you're using Um I have a service which you're using Um I have a service which you're using which is separate uh but you're not which is separate uh but you're not which is separate uh but you're not paying for the application just paying for the application just paying for the application just servicing your your account. Why should servicing your your account. Why should servicing your your account. Why should that application be uh subject to the that application be uh subject to the that application be uh subject to the CRA? And I I'm not sure I have a good CRA? And I I'm not sure I have a good CRA? And I I'm not sure I have a good answer for that and I think it's worth answer for that and I think it's worth answer for that and I think it's worth discussing. Fun fact, there is a discussing. Fun fact, there is a discussing. Fun fact, there is a different law that applies to banks different law that applies to banks different law that applies to banks which I believe is Dora. Okay, so ignore which I believe is Dora. Okay, so ignore which I believe is Dora. Okay, so ignore the banking one, but as a general as a the banking one, but as a general as a the banking one, but as a general as a general use case, he's always he always general use case, he's always he always general use case, he's always he always has an answer, but do you know what I has an answer, but do you know what I has an answer, but do you know what I mean? If if you're servicing something mean? If if you're servicing something mean? If if you're servicing something else, right, does it does it count if else, right, does it does it count if else, right, does it does it count if you're actually giving away the you're actually giving away the you're actually giving away the application for free? application for free? application for free? I I don't know. I I cannot give you I I don't know. I I cannot give you I I don't know. I I cannot give you advice on that. U I would ask you to advice on that. U I would ask you to advice on that. U I would ask you to consult your legal weasel and uh they'll consult your legal weasel and uh they'll consult your legal weasel and uh they'll hopefully help you. Mr. Bohannan might hopefully help you. Mr. Bohannan might hopefully help you. Mr. Bohannan might have an opinion though. No, no. So have an opinion though. No, no. So have an opinion though. No, no. So again, Mark Bohannan again. So my reason again, Mark Bohannan again. So my reason again, Mark Bohannan again. So my reason why I I suggested people suspend logic why I I suggested people suspend logic why I I suggested people suspend logic is this is a great example. The impetus is this is a great example. The impetus is this is a great example. The impetus for the CRA was in fact to go after the for the CRA was in fact to go after the for the CRA was in fact to go after the internet of things IoT products. Okay. internet of things IoT products. Okay. internet of things IoT products. Okay. So, the irony is what you're describing So, the irony is what you're describing So, the irony is what you're describing is precisely what was meant to be is precisely what was meant to be is precisely what was meant to be addressed by the addressed by the addressed by the CRA. My policy answer, not a legal CRA. My policy answer, not a legal CRA. My policy answer, not a legal answer, is that what would be relevant answer, is that what would be relevant answer, is that what would be relevant are the components of what's in that app are the components of what's in that app are the components of what's in that app are very much potentially subject, but are very much potentially subject, but are very much potentially subject, but the app itself since they're not selling the app itself since they're not selling the app itself since they're not selling it is not. That that's the way I would it is not. That that's the way I would it is not. That that's the way I would think about it. But this was meant to think about it. But this was meant to think about it. But this was meant to address and in fact we all argued for address and in fact we all argued for address and in fact we all argued for years have this just apply to IoT and years have this just apply to IoT and years have this just apply to IoT and that's a much more focused way to do that's a much more focused way to do that's a much more focused way to do this. No, they wanted you know my this. No, they wanted you know my this. No, they wanted you know my favorite quote was someone in the favorite quote was someone in the favorite quote was someone in the commission uh we were meeting and said commission uh we were meeting and said commission uh we were meeting and said well you know my my lettuce is regulated well you know my my lettuce is regulated well you know my my lettuce is regulated better than software is so let's get it better than software is so let's get it better than software is so let's get it better and I'm like literally that was a better and I'm like literally that was a better and I'm like literally that was a comment. So this is the mentality, the comment. So this is the mentality, the comment. So this is the mentality, the framework, the experience they're framework, the experience they're framework, the experience they're bringing to this. But uh keep in mind bringing to this. But uh keep in mind bringing to this. But uh keep in mind this was originally driven by a desire this was originally driven by a desire this was originally driven by a desire to regulate IoT. to regulate IoT. to regulate IoT. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Can I just add to that? Yes. What he Can I just add to that? Yes. What he Can I just add to that? Yes. What he said a thousand times over, right? said a thousand times over, right? said a thousand times over, right? Regulators in Europe are really pissed Regulators in Europe are really pissed Regulators in Europe are really pissed off at the industry for not solving this off at the industry for not solving this off at the industry for not solving this problem and they're not super interested problem and they're not super interested problem and they're not super interested in your nuances, right? And they have in your nuances, right? And they have in your nuances, right? And they have the power and they're going to use that the power and they're going to use that the power and they're going to use that power and they're going to make your power and they're going to make your power and they're going to make your lives very difficult if you don't start lives very difficult if you don't start lives very difficult if you don't start fixing this and doing it. It's just fixing this and doing it. It's just fixing this and doing it. It's just they're not screwing around. Decades of they're not screwing around. Decades of they're not screwing around. Decades of waiting for it to get fixed out have not waiting for it to get fixed out have not waiting for it to get fixed out have not worked out and they stopped waiting. And worked out and they stopped waiting. And worked out and they stopped waiting. And the botnet thing of IoT, they're worried the botnet thing of IoT, they're worried the botnet thing of IoT, they're worried about not just your router not working about not just your router not working about not just your router not working well for you or leaking your internet. well for you or leaking your internet. well for you or leaking your internet. They're worried about it becoming a They're worried about it becoming a They're worried about it becoming a botnet taking over the next nuclear botnet taking over the next nuclear botnet taking over the next nuclear power plants, right? They really care. power plants, right? They really care. power plants, right? They really care. And then if you are like, well, I'm And then if you are like, well, I'm And then if you are like, well, I'm giving this software away. Like, are you giving this software away. Like, are you giving this software away. Like, are you doing business? Is this software part of doing business? Is this software part of doing business? Is this software part of your business? Screw you. Right? They're your business? Screw you. Right? They're your business? Screw you. Right? They're not interested in your nuances. Right? not interested in your nuances. Right? not interested in your nuances. Right? To to illustrate the lack of nuance in To to illustrate the lack of nuance in To to illustrate the lack of nuance in their thinking here. Right? They didn't their thinking here. Right? They didn't their thinking here. Right? They didn't even put open source on this until after even put open source on this until after even put open source on this until after a couple of iterations and a lot of a couple of iterations and a lot of a couple of iterations and a lot of noise and a lot of really helpful people noise and a lot of really helpful people noise and a lot of really helpful people banging drums very loudly. And so it was banging drums very loudly. And so it was banging drums very loudly. And so it was going to be a train wreck of epic going to be a train wreck of epic going to be a train wreck of epic proportions because they didn't want proportions because they didn't want proportions because they didn't want open source. and they look to be blunt open source. and they look to be blunt open source. and they look to be blunt at the Linux Foundation as an industry at the Linux Foundation as an industry at the Linux Foundation as an industry consortium that allows them to hide consortium that allows them to hide consortium that allows them to hide behind a nonprofit as opposed to being behind a nonprofit as opposed to being behind a nonprofit as opposed to being liable for things. They're not wrong, liable for things. They're not wrong, liable for things. They're not wrong, they're not right. It's complicated. they're not right. It's complicated. they're not right. It's complicated. It's nuanced. They don't care about It's nuanced. They don't care about It's nuanced. They don't care about nuance, nuance, nuance, right? So, if you're sitting there and right? So, if you're sitting there and right? So, if you're sitting there and you do business in Europe with a product you do business in Europe with a product you do business in Europe with a product that has a digital element, you are on that has a digital element, you are on that has a digital element, you are on the hook and they don't care about any the hook and they don't care about any the hook and they don't care about any reason you can find to get away from it. reason you can find to get away from it. reason you can find to get away from it. I am not a lawyer and I don't care if I I am not a lawyer and I don't care if I I am not a lawyer and I don't care if I say these things, right? Please, we we have extra. So, I'm right?

Uh, and I another question from Discord. Uh, and I think you might have touched on this, so think you might have touched on this, so think you might have touched on this, so maybe just be covering some of the maybe just be covering some of the maybe just be covering some of the slides again. Uh, can you provide some slides again. Uh, can you provide some slides again. Uh, can you provide some resources for a company trying to be resources for a company trying to be resources for a company trying to be compliant with many of the EU compliant with many of the EU compliant with many of the EU regulations such as product liability regulations such as product liability regulations such as product liability directive and CRA? Are these covered in directive and CRA? Are these covered in directive and CRA? Are these covered in some of these resources where companies some of these resources where companies some of these resources where companies can be more efficient with the can be more efficient with the can be more efficient with the information that is related? information that is related? information that is related? Yes. Um that is again reflecting back on Yes. Um that is again reflecting back on Yes. Um that is again reflecting back on my work on the security baseline and my work on the security baseline and my work on the security baseline and this artifact I'm showing on the screen. this artifact I'm showing on the screen. this artifact I'm showing on the screen. Uh I have taken the baseline Uh I have taken the baseline Uh I have taken the baseline requirements and I have lined it up requirements and I have lined it up requirements and I have lined it up horizontally with um all my open SSF horizontally with um all my open SSF horizontally with um all my open SSF tools like Salsa and Scorecard and tools like Salsa and Scorecard and tools like Salsa and Scorecard and stuff. But then I line it up with the stuff. But then I line it up with the stuff. But then I line it up with the CRA, the SSDF, the CSF, CRA, the SSDF, the CSF, CRA, the SSDF, the CSF, um, Open Chain, Open CR. I'm in the um, Open Chain, Open CR. I'm in the um, Open Chain, Open CR. I'm in the middle of mapping a PCI DSS, um, a thing middle of mapping a PCI DSS, um, a thing middle of mapping a PCI DSS, um, a thing called PCR. Uh, then I'm going to move called PCR. Uh, then I'm going to move called PCR. Uh, then I'm going to move into Dora in this 2. So resources like into Dora in this 2. So resources like into Dora in this 2. So resources like this, you can see if I do this, you this, you can see if I do this, you this, you can see if I do this, you know, one one control here, you tick off know, one one control here, you tick off know, one one control here, you tick off the boxes on multiple compliance the boxes on multiple compliance the boxes on multiple compliance regimes. And this while I have not regimes. And this while I have not regimes. And this while I have not explicitly done 27,0001 and two um all explicitly done 27,0001 and two um all explicitly done 27,0001 and two um all of my training and certifications are of my training and certifications are of my training and certifications are sourced with 27,01 and two. So uh sourced with 27,01 and two. So uh sourced with 27,01 and two. So uh directionally this also follows that but directionally this also follows that but directionally this also follows that but I haven't done the direct mapping yet. I haven't done the direct mapping yet. I haven't done the direct mapping yet. But so yes, there are resources But so yes, there are resources But so yes, there are resources available that will show you you do available that will show you you do available that will show you you do these three things and you are able to these three things and you are able to these three things and you are able to either have evidence to defend yourself either have evidence to defend yourself either have evidence to defend yourself or you're doing uh the right practices or you're doing uh the right practices or you're doing uh the right practices to be able to uh meet that to be able to uh meet that to be able to uh meet that obligation. This is not for open source obligation. This is not for open source obligation. This is not for open source projects. Actually, I worked in banking projects. Actually, I worked in banking projects. Actually, I worked in banking for seven years. I had this spreadsheet for seven years. I had this spreadsheet for seven years. I had this spreadsheet because we had numerous uh banking because we had numerous uh banking because we had numerous uh banking regulators that I had to be beholden to regulators that I had to be beholden to regulators that I had to be beholden to and I was tired of failing audits. So we and I was tired of failing audits. So we and I was tired of failing audits. So we followed the strictest compliance regime followed the strictest compliance regime followed the strictest compliance regime um where I worked and this has been the um where I worked and this has been the um where I worked and this has been the kind of the the progeny of that work. So kind of the the progeny of that work. So kind of the the progeny of that work. So yes, if you follow some of these things yes, if you follow some of these things yes, if you follow some of these things which again are mom and apple pie cyber which again are mom and apple pie cyber which again are mom and apple pie cyber security uh but this is focused on security uh but this is focused on security uh but this is focused on development software creation uh development software creation uh development software creation uh compilation build and publication and compilation build and publication and compilation build and publication and then opera oper then opera oper then opera oper operationalization it's a mouthful so operationalization it's a mouthful so operationalization it's a mouthful so yes things like this help you meet yes things like this help you meet yes things like this help you meet different your different laws and different your different laws and different your different laws and frameworks frameworks frameworks so on the um the reporting timelines so on the um the reporting timelines so on the um the reporting timelines Did I understand the the second set of Did I understand the the second set of Did I understand the the second set of them was just on pure discovery of them was just on pure discovery of them was just on pure discovery of vulnerabilities? Yeah, that's normal vulnerabilities? Yeah, that's normal vulnerabilities? Yeah, that's normal vulnerabilities. vulnerabilities. vulnerabilities. So, companies with like super active bug So, companies with like super active bug So, companies with like super active bug bounty programs are pretty hosed at this bounty programs are pretty hosed at this bounty programs are pretty hosed at this point until they figure out some way to point until they figure out some way to point until they figure out some way to report everything constantly. Uh yeah, report everything constantly. Uh yeah, report everything constantly. Uh yeah, it's it's it's I there are some adjustments everyone's I there are some adjustments everyone's I there are some adjustments everyone's going to need to make to their programs. going to need to make to their programs. going to need to make to their programs. Yeah. Um there is um and I can't recall Yeah. Um there is um and I can't recall Yeah. Um there is um and I can't recall what article it is, but they do address what article it is, but they do address what article it is, but they do address things like embargos. things like embargos. things like embargos. Uh so you in certain circumstances you Uh so you in certain circumstances you Uh so you in certain circumstances you can get exclusion from the timeline but can get exclusion from the timeline but can get exclusion from the timeline but they don't give you like a well- they don't give you like a well- they don't give you like a well- definfined criteria and it's kind of definfined criteria and it's kind of definfined criteria and it's kind of weasly vaguely worded but basically I weasly vaguely worded but basically I weasly vaguely worded but basically I think you would need to petition ina think you would need to petition ina think you would need to petition ina predominantly to say hey I have a predominantly to say hey I have a predominantly to say hey I have a vulnerability it's going to take me uh vulnerability it's going to take me uh vulnerability it's going to take me uh three months to get staged uh downstream three months to get staged uh downstream three months to get staged uh downstream and you know I'd like to ask to be and you know I'd like to ask to be and you know I'd like to ask to be excluded from the timeline for this excluded from the timeline for this excluded from the timeline for this particular instance. But yeah, if you particular instance. But yeah, if you particular instance. But yeah, if you have a very active bug bounty program or have a very active bug bounty program or have a very active bug bounty program or you're, you know, somebody like Red Hat, you're, you know, somebody like Red Hat, you're, you know, somebody like Red Hat, Canon, Canonicle, or Susi that you're Canon, Canonicle, or Susi that you're Canon, Canonicle, or Susi that you're pushing out 100 patches a day, um pushing out 100 patches a day, um pushing out 100 patches a day, um there's going to be some adjustments there's going to be some adjustments there's going to be some adjustments you're going to need to make to figure you're going to need to make to figure you're going to need to make to figure out how you're going to deliver those out how you're going to deliver those out how you're going to deliver those fixes and the timeline requirements. So fixes and the timeline requirements. So fixes and the timeline requirements. So my my answer question, yeah, sort of to my my answer question, yeah, sort of to my my answer question, yeah, sort of to add to that a bit, my understanding of add to that a bit, my understanding of add to that a bit, my understanding of of that is this is one of those places of that is this is one of those places of that is this is one of those places where they're looking for manufacturers where they're looking for manufacturers where they're looking for manufacturers to get really good relationships with to get really good relationships with to get really good relationships with with the local seaerts and stuff so that with the local seaerts and stuff so that with the local seaerts and stuff so that they they know how this works and and they they know how this works and and they they know how this works and and it's not a surprise basically, right? it's not a surprise basically, right? it's not a surprise basically, right? Boning a friend. Boning a friend. Boning a friend. Hello. First of all, I'm not a lawyer. Hello. First of all, I'm not a lawyer. Hello. First of all, I'm not a lawyer. very important mention um regarding very important mention um regarding very important mention um regarding severe incident um I think okay severe incident um I think okay severe incident um I think okay yes cool right so regarding severe yes cool right so regarding severe yes cool right so regarding severe incident I think the definition included incident I think the definition included incident I think the definition included something like sensitive or important something like sensitive or important something like sensitive or important data functions so that data functions so that data functions so that yeah so that means it's not applicable yeah so that means it's not applicable yeah so that means it's not applicable to necessarily any vulnerability but to necessarily any vulnerability but to necessarily any vulnerability but it's going to be a mess to actually draw it's going to be a mess to actually draw it's going to be a mess to actually draw the line right as to where that is right the line right as to where that is right the line right as to where that is right do you have a I think you add the do you have a I think you add the do you have a I think you add the definition somewhere definition somewhere definition somewhere else. Uh this is it right here. Yeah. else. Uh this is it right here. Yeah. else. Uh this is it right here. Yeah. Sensitive or important data or Sensitive or important data or Sensitive or important data or functions. So essentially a functions. So essentially a functions. So essentially a predominantly focused on consumer data. predominantly focused on consumer data. predominantly focused on consumer data. So think GDPR type things PII PHI. So if So think GDPR type things PII PHI. So if So think GDPR type things PII PHI. So if your your your app your thing if it breaks has the app your thing if it breaks has the app your thing if it breaks has the ability to expose that information ability to expose that information ability to expose that information that's when that's the severe incident. that's when that's the severe incident. that's when that's the severe incident. Broadly anything that touches Broadly anything that touches Broadly anything that touches confidentiality probably is going to be confidentiality probably is going to be confidentiality probably is going to be in scope and again then integrity in scope and again then integrity in scope and again then integrity depends on the data right depends on the depends on the data right depends on the depends on the data right depends on the data data data uh I don't know that they're interested uh I don't know that they're interested uh I don't know that they're interested in having that debate but yes so there in having that debate but yes so there in having that debate but yes so there are the potential to have things that are the potential to have things that are the potential to have things that aren't uh in scope but then you have aren't uh in scope but then you have aren't uh in scope but then you have you're modifying your core like PERT you're modifying your core like PERT you're modifying your core like PERT vulnerability triage and handling vulnerability triage and handling vulnerability triage and handling process so do you want to have two process so do you want to have two process so do you want to have two different processes different processes different processes And do you have the ability?
