Um that's uh something that's really Um that's uh something that's really Um that's uh something that's really near and dear to my heart is just near and dear to my heart is just near and dear to my heart is just figuring out how to support open source figuring out how to support open source figuring out how to support open source projects on providing security and projects on providing security and projects on providing security and security features to their end users. Uh security features to their end users. Uh security features to their end users. Uh there's a few people in that I'm looking there's a few people in that I'm looking there's a few people in that I'm looking at right now that are very invested in at right now that are very invested in at right now that are very invested in providing security features to end providing security features to end providing security features to end users. Uh so thank you guys uh for that users. Uh so thank you guys uh for that users. Uh so thank you guys uh for that male I'm looking at you guys. Um, one of male I'm looking at you guys. Um, one of male I'm looking at you guys. Um, one of the big things that is my background of the big things that is my background of the big things that is my background of how I got started with that is when I how I got started with that is when I how I got started with that is when I was working in finance at some of the was working in finance at some of the was working in finance at some of the tier one banks, I got asked to represent tier one banks, I got asked to represent tier one banks, I got asked to represent ourselves and and look at tools that ourselves and and look at tools that ourselves and and look at tools that exist in open source and that's how I exist in open source and that's how I exist in open source and that's how I got started at the fintech open source got started at the fintech open source got started at the fintech open source foundation uh where I'm now uh serving foundation uh where I'm now uh serving foundation uh where I'm now uh serving as a leader over some of the the as a leader over some of the the as a leader over some of the the different initiatives that are there and different initiatives that are there and different initiatives that are there and with these two guys helped create the with these two guys helped create the with these two guys helped create the open source project security baseline open source project security baseline open source project security baseline which we're going to talk about a a which we're going to talk about a a which we're going to talk about a a little bit later on. little bit later on. little bit later on. Excellent. Excellent. Excellent. So, some of us had a longer journey here So, some of us had a longer journey here So, some of us had a longer journey here today than others. I heard that you two today than others. I heard that you two today than others. I heard that you two uh just got here from London. You guys uh just got here from London. You guys uh just got here from London. You guys were doing a keynote at were doing a keynote at were doing a keynote at KubeCon. Maybe uh talk a little bit KubeCon. Maybe uh talk a little bit KubeCon. Maybe uh talk a little bit about that experience and what some of about that experience and what some of about that experience and what some of the conversation was over there. Yeah. the conversation was over there. Yeah. the conversation was over there. Yeah. Um Um Um so, raise of hands for real this time. so, raise of hands for real this time. so, raise of hands for real this time. Most of you are not going to need to Most of you are not going to need to Most of you are not going to need to raise your hand. Who has read the term raise your hand. Who has read the term raise your hand. Who has read the term products with digital elements at least products with digital elements at least products with digital elements at least 343 times in the last couple months? Oh, 343 times in the last couple months? Oh, 343 times in the last couple months? Oh, this is my audience. I love you guys. We this is my audience. I love you guys. We this is my audience. I love you guys. We have nothing to teach here, Mike. have nothing to teach here, Mike. have nothing to teach here, Mike. We had a crowd of 5,000 people in front We had a crowd of 5,000 people in front We had a crowd of 5,000 people in front of us on Friday and one person raised of us on Friday and one person raised of us on Friday and one person raised their hand. Maybe the rest were shy. their hand. Maybe the rest were shy. their hand. Maybe the rest were shy. Maybe the ones in the back we couldn't Maybe the ones in the back we couldn't Maybe the ones in the back we couldn't see. Yeah. But very very very different. see. Yeah. But very very very different. see. Yeah. But very very very different. Um, so yeah. So, so CRA was the topic Um, so yeah. So, so CRA was the topic Um, so yeah. So, so CRA was the topic that we got to talk about. Um, it has that we got to talk about. Um, it has that we got to talk about. Um, it has globe spanning implications, right? Uh, globe spanning implications, right? Uh, globe spanning implications, right? Uh, which you can tell by the fact that I'm which you can tell by the fact that I'm which you can tell by the fact that I'm American, Mike's American. Yeah. And, American, Mike's American. Yeah. And, American, Mike's American. Yeah. And, uh, we were invited to go to London in uh, we were invited to go to London in uh, we were invited to go to London in the UK to talk about legislation in the the UK to talk about legislation in the the UK to talk about legislation in the European Union. European Union. European Union. Um but I think it really Um but I think it really Um but I think it really does um but you know I think to to what does um but you know I think to to what does um but you know I think to to what Eddie was just saying um it really does Eddie was just saying um it really does Eddie was just saying um it really does speak to the sort of global impact these speak to the sort of global impact these speak to the sort of global impact these legisl that this legislation and various legisl that this legislation and various legisl that this legislation and various other regulations across the globe are other regulations across the globe are other regulations across the globe are having that hey uh it doesn't matter who having that hey uh it doesn't matter who having that hey uh it doesn't matter who introduced the law if you're selling in introduced the law if you're selling in introduced the law if you're selling in that market uh you are impacted by it that market uh you are impacted by it that market uh you are impacted by it and and and yet Linux Foundation did some research yet Linux Foundation did some research yet Linux Foundation did some research recently uh we did two papers of this uh recently uh we did two papers of this uh recently uh we did two papers of this uh infographic is from a document called infographic is from a document called infographic is from a document called unaware and unaware and unaware and uncertain and uh this is a a pretty uncertain and uh this is a a pretty uncertain and uh this is a a pretty stunning figure. We they interviewed 600 stunning figure. We they interviewed 600 stunning figure. We they interviewed 600 upstream maintainers uh some upstream maintainers uh some upstream maintainers uh some manufacturers and several people that manufacturers and several people that manufacturers and several people that identified as open source stewards. So identified as open source stewards. So identified as open source stewards. So broadly like people from foundations but broadly like people from foundations but broadly like people from foundations but not exclusively. not exclusively. not exclusively. And 62% said that they were not familiar And 62% said that they were not familiar And 62% said that they were not familiar at all or were only slightly familiar at all or were only slightly familiar at all or were only slightly familiar with the law. And there was a with the law. And there was a with the law. And there was a significant the majority of folks that significant the majority of folks that significant the majority of folks that participated were from the US and EU. It participated were from the US and EU. It participated were from the US and EU. It was kind of evenly split between those was kind of evenly split between those was kind of evenly split between those with some folks from Apac and other with some folks from Apac and other with some folks from Apac and other parts of the world participating as parts of the world participating as parts of the world participating as well. well. well. Yeah. And I think um again if you are Yeah. And I think um again if you are Yeah. And I think um again if you are selling in the European Union right if selling in the European Union right if selling in the European Union right if you're selling software or rather you're selling software or rather you're selling software or rather products with digital elements which products with digital elements which products with digital elements which means put simply it just means if I am means put simply it just means if I am means put simply it just means if I am shipping you bits whether those bits are shipping you bits whether those bits are shipping you bits whether those bits are literally just like software over the literally just like software over the literally just like software over the internet or whether it is um I am internet or whether it is um I am internet or whether it is um I am handing you an IoT device uh you need to handing you an IoT device uh you need to handing you an IoT device uh you need to follow that law and so um yeah it was a follow that law and so um yeah it was a follow that law and so um yeah it was a bit surprising um with That said, I bit surprising um with That said, I bit surprising um with That said, I think there's a a lot of stuff that think there's a a lot of stuff that think there's a a lot of stuff that we're doing to kind of help fix that. we're doing to kind of help fix that. we're doing to kind of help fix that. Absolutely. So, my first question for Absolutely. So, my first question for Absolutely. So, my first question for this esteemed group is how do I know if this esteemed group is how do I know if this esteemed group is how do I know if my firm or organization is potentially my firm or organization is potentially my firm or organization is potentially could be fined? could be fined? could be fined? Yeah. Uh, so there's there's three Yeah. Uh, so there's there's three Yeah. Uh, so there's there's three different personas in the CRA, right? different personas in the CRA, right? different personas in the CRA, right? And all of these are uh people who have And all of these are uh people who have And all of these are uh people who have any sort of downstream impact to the any sort of downstream impact to the any sort of downstream impact to the European market, which a lot of us do, European market, which a lot of us do, European market, which a lot of us do, some of us don't, right? if you're if some of us don't, right? if you're if some of us don't, right? if you're if you're just a US or or just in your you're just a US or or just in your you're just a US or or just in your country and you're not going and country and you're not going and country and you're not going and reaching out to the European Union might reaching out to the European Union might reaching out to the European Union might not impact you. Uh CVS, right? Think the not impact you. Uh CVS, right? Think the not impact you. Uh CVS, right? Think the the the Walgreens competitor, right, is the the Walgreens competitor, right, is the the Walgreens competitor, right, is the first example I can think of where the first example I can think of where the first example I can think of where they just a while back turned off their they just a while back turned off their they just a while back turned off their websites to the to the EU. They're just websites to the to the EU. They're just websites to the to the EU. They're just like I don't know if that's still the like I don't know if that's still the like I don't know if that's still the case today, but yeah, you could do that. case today, but yeah, you could do that. case today, but yeah, you could do that. If you're literally not touching the the If you're literally not touching the the If you're literally not touching the the EU, then this might not have any impact EU, then this might not have any impact EU, then this might not have any impact on you. But if you do have any on you. But if you do have any on you. But if you do have any downstream impact to the to the EU, downstream impact to the to the EU, downstream impact to the to the EU, you're most likely going to be in one of you're most likely going to be in one of you're most likely going to be in one of three personas. Possibly you might be three personas. Possibly you might be three personas. Possibly you might be double dipping. Uh the three personas, double dipping. Uh the three personas, double dipping. Uh the three personas, Mike, do you want to touch on that? Mike, do you want to touch on that? Mike, do you want to touch on that? Sure. Yeah. So the the three personas Sure. Yeah. So the the three personas Sure. Yeah. So the the three personas are you have um open source maintainers are you have um open source maintainers are you have um open source maintainers or three primary personas. Open source or three primary personas. Open source or three primary personas. Open source maintainers, uh open source stewards, maintainers, uh open source stewards, maintainers, uh open source stewards, and and and manufacturers. So uh let's kind of work manufacturers. So uh let's kind of work manufacturers. So uh let's kind of work in reverse. If you're a manufacturer, in reverse. If you're a manufacturer, in reverse. If you're a manufacturer, which means I am which means I am which means I am bringing a product with digital elements bringing a product with digital elements bringing a product with digital elements to market in the European to market in the European to market in the European Union, you are you have to follow this Union, you are you have to follow this Union, you are you have to follow this or you will get fined. Um, take a step or you will get fined. Um, take a step or you will get fined. Um, take a step back and we'll kind of go into more back and we'll kind of go into more back and we'll kind of go into more details in a little bit, but like if details in a little bit, but like if details in a little bit, but like if you're an open source steward like the you're an open source steward like the you're an open source steward like the Linux Foundation, um, you know, Open Linux Foundation, um, you know, Open Linux Foundation, um, you know, Open SSF, Eclipse, Yep. all those great SSF, Eclipse, Yep. all those great SSF, Eclipse, Yep. all those great folks. Uh you don't really have any folks. Uh you don't really have any folks. Uh you don't really have any legal liability, but there still are legal liability, but there still are legal liability, but there still are suggestions for you know participating suggestions for you know participating suggestions for you know participating and and the customtailored uh and and the customtailored uh and and the customtailored uh customtailored highly specific reg customtailored highly specific reg customtailored highly specific reg regulatory regime. Uh I forgot I missed regulatory regime. Uh I forgot I missed regulatory regime. Uh I forgot I missed that. Yeah. Light touch. Light touch. that. Yeah. Light touch. Light touch. that. Yeah. Light touch. Light touch. That's a Yeah. Uh so there is some That's a Yeah. Uh so there is some That's a Yeah. Uh so there is some regulation for the steward such as Linux regulation for the steward such as Linux regulation for the steward such as Linux Foundation, Apache, Eclipse. Yeah. And Foundation, Apache, Eclipse. Yeah. And Foundation, Apache, Eclipse. Yeah. And then followed by open source maintainers then followed by open source maintainers then followed by open source maintainers which contrary to all the fear which contrary to all the fear which contrary to all the fear uncertainty doubt around this if you are uncertainty doubt around this if you are uncertainty doubt around this if you are an open source maintainer who is not an open source maintainer who is not an open source maintainer who is not bringing a product with digital elements bringing a product with digital elements bringing a product with digital elements to market in the European Union you have to market in the European Union you have to market in the European Union you have no issues like you have nothing you no issues like you have nothing you no issues like you have nothing you don't have any responsibility nobody can don't have any responsibility nobody can don't have any responsibility nobody can come sue you because you have a come sue you because you have a come sue you because you have a vulnerability in the project you were vulnerability in the project you were vulnerability in the project you were working on over the weekend or whatever. working on over the weekend or whatever. working on over the weekend or whatever. Yeah, just because you made your co code Yeah, just because you made your co code Yeah, just because you made your co code publicly available on GitHub does not publicly available on GitHub does not publicly available on GitHub does not mean that you are accountable to mean that you are accountable to mean that you are accountable to somebody picking it up and using it. somebody picking it up and using it. somebody picking it up and using it. Yep. Which I think also speaks to a lot Yep. Which I think also speaks to a lot Yep. Which I think also speaks to a lot of manufacturers. You can't pass the of manufacturers. You can't pass the of manufacturers. You can't pass the buck anymore. You can't go and say, buck anymore. You can't go and say, buck anymore. You can't go and say, "Hey, I'm including let's say Kubernetes "Hey, I'm including let's say Kubernetes "Hey, I'm including let's say Kubernetes as part of, you know, my project. Oh, as part of, you know, my project. Oh, as part of, you know, my project. Oh, there's a vulnerability in Kubernetes. I there's a vulnerability in Kubernetes. I there's a vulnerability in Kubernetes. I don't know what to do about it." Well, don't know what to do about it." Well, don't know what to do about it." Well, when I get angry grams from, you know, when I get angry grams from, you know, when I get angry grams from, you know, my customers or the European Union my customers or the European Union my customers or the European Union about, hey, you have this vulnerability. about, hey, you have this vulnerability. about, hey, you have this vulnerability. You didn't do anything to address it. You didn't do anything to address it. You didn't do anything to address it. Oh, it was open source. It's not my Oh, it was open source. It's not my Oh, it was open source. It's not my responsibility. No, it is your responsibility. No, it is your responsibility. No, it is your responsibility. responsibility. responsibility. Yeah. Especially if you're using like Yeah. Especially if you're using like Yeah. Especially if you're using like vanilla Kubernetes, uh you are going to vanilla Kubernetes, uh you are going to vanilla Kubernetes, uh you are going to be responsible for any vulnerabilities be responsible for any vulnerabilities be responsible for any vulnerabilities that are present in the version of that are present in the version of that are present in the version of Kubernetes that you're using. But if Kubernetes that you're using. But if Kubernetes that you're using. But if you're purchasing that from let's say a you're purchasing that from let's say a you're purchasing that from let's say a big cloud provider, managed service big cloud provider, managed service big cloud provider, managed service provider, uh they are going to be provider, uh they are going to be provider, uh they are going to be delivering that product to you. That is delivering that product to you. That is delivering that product to you. That is the commercial that is the point that the commercial that is the point that the commercial that is the point that the commercial activity is taking place. the commercial activity is taking place. the commercial activity is taking place. So they will be held accountable uh and So they will be held accountable uh and So they will be held accountable uh and your legal liability will be offset uh your legal liability will be offset uh your legal liability will be offset uh through the commercial activity there. through the commercial activity there. through the commercial activity there. So this has been a source of a lot of So this has been a source of a lot of So this has been a source of a lot of confusion and frustration. Uh the law, confusion and frustration. Uh the law, confusion and frustration. Uh the law, if nobody has had the chance to read it, if nobody has had the chance to read it, if nobody has had the chance to read it, is uh nearly a hundred pages long and uh is uh nearly a hundred pages long and uh is uh nearly a hundred pages long and uh our European friends like to write. It's our European friends like to write. It's our European friends like to write. It's a lot of words and uh so that term a lot of words and uh so that term a lot of words and uh so that term products with digital elements like products with digital elements like products with digital elements like literally does show up in that document literally does show up in that document literally does show up in that document hundreds of times. They don't hundreds of times. They don't hundreds of times. They don't abbreviate. They're very precise, which abbreviate. They're very precise, which abbreviate. They're very precise, which is good. Um but it's also a little is good. Um but it's also a little is good. Um but it's also a little challenging kind of reading through the challenging kind of reading through the challenging kind of reading through the convoluted stuff. convoluted stuff. convoluted stuff. But um thinking about this, you know, But um thinking about this, you know, But um thinking about this, you know, what matters to me? I'm a product what matters to me? I'm a product what matters to me? I'm a product security person. I'm an upstream open security person. I'm an upstream open security person. I'm an upstream open source developer. Um I I I don't work in source developer. Um I I I don't work in source developer. Um I I I don't work in legal or legal or legal or GRC. How does this regulatory compliance GRC. How does this regulatory compliance GRC. How does this regulatory compliance kind of relate to realw world security? kind of relate to realw world security? kind of relate to realw world security? Give me some insights, guys. Give me some insights, guys. Give me some insights, guys. Yeah. Uh I'm at risk of going long on Yeah. Uh I'm at risk of going long on Yeah. Uh I'm at risk of going long on this one. Uh so so who's heard who's this one. Uh so so who's heard who's this one. Uh so so who's heard who's heard like security is not compliance? heard like security is not compliance? heard like security is not compliance? That's something that is just yeah That's something that is just yeah That's something that is just yeah security is not compliance right we all security is not compliance right we all security is not compliance right we all agree with that and yet we find agree with that and yet we find agree with that and yet we find ourselves in security constantly asking ourselves in security constantly asking ourselves in security constantly asking what standards should I be meeting what what standards should I be meeting what what standards should I be meeting what guidelines should I follow could you guidelines should I follow could you guidelines should I follow could you guys give me a control catalog uh that I guys give me a control catalog uh that I guys give me a control catalog uh that I could actually like pass off to my could actually like pass off to my could actually like pass off to my implementers to to work from yes yeah implementers to to work from yes yeah implementers to to work from yes yeah like like because just saying um do NIST like like because just saying um do NIST like like because just saying um do NIST is is not super super practical when is is not super super practical when is is not super super practical when what I'm trying to do is deploy landing what I'm trying to do is deploy landing what I'm trying to do is deploy landing zone for client facing applications, zone for client facing applications, zone for client facing applications, right? Uh so in in that capacity, right? Uh so in in that capacity, right? Uh so in in that capacity, security and compliance need to be security and compliance need to be security and compliance need to be tightly coupled because standards, tightly coupled because standards, tightly coupled because standards, guidelines, frameworks are extremely guidelines, frameworks are extremely guidelines, frameworks are extremely helpful for helping us figure out what helpful for helping us figure out what helpful for helping us figure out what we need to be doing to bring real world we need to be doing to bring real world we need to be doing to bring real world security in play. Now that that gets to security in play. Now that that gets to security in play. Now that that gets to the bottom, I touched on the orange the bottom, I touched on the orange the bottom, I touched on the orange text. Mike, do you want to touch on the text. Mike, do you want to touch on the text. Mike, do you want to touch on the the white text on the last slide? Sure. the white text on the last slide? Sure. the white text on the last slide? Sure. Um Um Um so I've worked at uh many of also a so I've worked at uh many of also a so I've worked at uh many of also a financial institution in in the past and um the challenge is even though security um the challenge is even though security um the challenge is even though security is not is not is not compliance as time has gone on those compliance as time has gone on those compliance as time has gone on those lines begin to get blurriier and lines begin to get blurriier and lines begin to get blurriier and blurriier every year where especially blurriier every year where especially blurriier every year where especially how quickly how quickly how quickly uh security development is happening um uh security development is happening um uh security development is happening um in in sort of these spaces and you know in in sort of these spaces and you know in in sort of these spaces and you know you know you go back a couple of decades you know you go back a couple of decades you know you go back a couple of decades ago and doing compliance and doing ago and doing compliance and doing ago and doing compliance and doing security hey I'm releasing software once security hey I'm releasing software once security hey I'm releasing software once a year or whatever you can have the a year or whatever you can have the a year or whatever you can have the audit once a year now we're talking audit once a year now we're talking audit once a year now we're talking about continuous compliance continuous about continuous compliance continuous about continuous compliance continuous audits those sorts of things where hey I audits those sorts of things where hey I audits those sorts of things where hey I am releasing no am releasing no am releasing no longer once a year I'm potentially longer once a year I'm potentially longer once a year I'm potentially releasing once a month, once a week, releasing once a month, once a week, releasing once a month, once a week, once a day, sometimes even several times once a day, sometimes even several times once a day, sometimes even several times a day. a day. a day. And we're seeing that, hey, like the the And we're seeing that, hey, like the the And we're seeing that, hey, like the the once every year audit is just not going once every year audit is just not going once every year audit is just not going to cut it anymore. And we're seeing a to cut it anymore. And we're seeing a to cut it anymore. And we're seeing a lot more in continuous compliance. And lot more in continuous compliance. And lot more in continuous compliance. And then also, even if you are still doing then also, even if you are still doing then also, even if you are still doing that audit once a year, you don't want that audit once a year, you don't want that audit once a year, you don't want to be surprised around, you know, hey, to be surprised around, you know, hey, to be surprised around, you know, hey, it's it's the yearly audit time again. it's it's the yearly audit time again. it's it's the yearly audit time again. And oh my gosh, for the past 6 months And oh my gosh, for the past 6 months And oh my gosh, for the past 6 months you haven't been following the right you haven't been following the right you haven't been following the right practices because you know security went practices because you know security went practices because you know security went off and did a thing but they didn't off and did a thing but they didn't off and did a thing but they didn't inform legal, they didn't inform inform legal, they didn't inform inform legal, they didn't inform compliance or vice versa. Legal and compliance or vice versa. Legal and compliance or vice versa. Legal and compliance knew new knew uh uh compliance knew new knew uh uh compliance knew new knew uh uh restrictions came into place but they restrictions came into place but they restrictions came into place but they they didn't bring security into it. So they didn't bring security into it. So they didn't bring security into it. So they weren't aware that hey you know you they weren't aware that hey you know you they weren't aware that hey you know you didn't cross this tea or dot that eye didn't cross this tea or dot that eye didn't cross this tea or dot that eye and now we have six months of evidence and now we have six months of evidence and now we have six months of evidence sort of lost. sort of lost. sort of lost. So the CRA is broadly for this audience So the CRA is broadly for this audience So the CRA is broadly for this audience divided into two categories of interest divided into two categories of interest divided into two categories of interest for you. The first part is around uh for you. The first part is around uh for you. The first part is around uh software development practices. So SDLC, software development practices. So SDLC, software development practices. So SDLC, secure by design, secure by default. The secure by design, secure by default. The secure by design, secure by default. The other half is of specific interest to other half is of specific interest to other half is of specific interest to Volcon because it dives deeply into Volcon because it dives deeply into Volcon because it dives deeply into coordinated vulnerability disclosure and coordinated vulnerability disclosure and coordinated vulnerability disclosure and vulnerability management practices of vulnerability management practices of vulnerability management practices of the uh manufacturer. and a little bit on the uh manufacturer. and a little bit on the uh manufacturer. and a little bit on stewards. So let's spend some time stewards. So let's spend some time stewards. So let's spend some time jibberjabbering about this. So jibberjabbering about this. So jibberjabbering about this. So vulnerability management is this vulnerability management is this vulnerability management is this something you we talk a lot about something you we talk a lot about something you we talk a lot about upstream? Is this something that uh upstream? Is this something that uh upstream? Is this something that uh downstream does a lot? So like as as downstream does a lot? So like as as downstream does a lot? So like as as open source manage maintainers um open source manage maintainers um open source manage maintainers um vulnerability management vulnerability management vulnerability management um how often do you have to think about um how often do you have to think about um how often do you have to think about vulnerability management when you're vulnerability management when you're vulnerability management when you're releasing Kubernetes? releasing Kubernetes? releasing Kubernetes? The the answer was what we all expected. The the answer was what we all expected. The the answer was what we all expected. A deep sigh, eyes rolled back into the A deep sigh, eyes rolled back into the A deep sigh, eyes rolled back into the skull. Uh every time a vulnerability is announced, every time a vulnerability is announced, every time a vulnerability is announced, you've lost three days of your life. To resolve it. Yeah. So, so the the most To resolve it. Yeah. So, so the the most To resolve it. Yeah. So, so the the most uh high like largest maintainer base of uh high like largest maintainer base of uh high like largest maintainer base of any open source software uh one of the any open source software uh one of the any open source software uh one of the most highly regulated pieces of open most highly regulated pieces of open most highly regulated pieces of open soft open source software in spite of soft open source software in spite of soft open source software in spite of the fact that there's no legal the fact that there's no legal the fact that there's no legal liabilities to it. Um still takes 3 days liabilities to it. Um still takes 3 days liabilities to it. Um still takes 3 days of dedicated focused effort from a of dedicated focused effort from a of dedicated focused effort from a massive team to be able to deliver a fix massive team to be able to deliver a fix massive team to be able to deliver a fix for a known vulnerability. Um that's for a known vulnerability. Um that's for a known vulnerability. Um that's that's huge, right? Uh, now think about that's huge, right? Uh, now think about that's huge, right? Uh, now think about somebody who is maintaining 200 somebody who is maintaining 200 somebody who is maintaining 200 products. I'm thinking of Jordan, right? products. I'm thinking of Jordan, right? products. I'm thinking of Jordan, right? If if if there's a vulnerability found If if if there's a vulnerability found If if if there's a vulnerability found in one of one of these projects in a in one of one of these projects in a in one of one of these projects in a Python ecosystem, um, being able to Python ecosystem, um, being able to Python ecosystem, um, being able to manage those vulnerabilities is a huge manage those vulnerabilities is a huge manage those vulnerabilities is a huge lift. Uh, so the fact that the CRA is lift. Uh, so the fact that the CRA is lift. Uh, so the fact that the CRA is moving legal liability from the open moving legal liability from the open moving legal liability from the open source maintainers is a a huge benefit. source maintainers is a a huge benefit. source maintainers is a a huge benefit. Yeah. Uh, oh, did you want it? It's a Yeah. Uh, oh, did you want it? It's a Yeah. Uh, oh, did you want it? It's a huge benefitish huge benefitish huge benefitish uh to the maintainers. The it's great uh to the maintainers. The it's great uh to the maintainers. The it's great for the for the for the maintainersish except the manufacturers maintainersish except the manufacturers maintainersish except the manufacturers have some incredibly have some incredibly have some incredibly uh optimistic delivery timelines they're uh optimistic delivery timelines they're uh optimistic delivery timelines they're required to hit. So within uh 24 hours required to hit. So within uh 24 hours required to hit. So within uh 24 hours they're required to provide some notice they're required to provide some notice they're required to provide some notice that they're they're aware of a exploit that they're they're aware of a exploit that they're they're aware of a exploit or a severe vulnerability depend there's or a severe vulnerability depend there's or a severe vulnerability depend there's two paths. um you've got 72 hours to two paths. um you've got 72 hours to two paths. um you've got 72 hours to have a security advisory together and have a security advisory together and have a security advisory together and that you're strongly encouraged to have that you're strongly encouraged to have that you're strongly encouraged to have that fix ready, a patch or at a minimum that fix ready, a patch or at a minimum that fix ready, a patch or at a minimum a workaround and then you've got like a a workaround and then you've got like a a workaround and then you've got like a month to do kind of a postmortem and month to do kind of a postmortem and month to do kind of a postmortem and have your final ducks in a row. So the have your final ducks in a row. So the have your final ducks in a row. So the maintainer, the manufacturers have all maintainer, the manufacturers have all maintainer, the manufacturers have all these legal these legal these legal obligations. But um let me ask here of obligations. But um let me ask here of obligations. But um let me ask here of those of you that work at a commercial those of you that work at a commercial those of you that work at a commercial enterprise uh how many of you directly enterprise uh how many of you directly enterprise uh how many of you directly contribute or interact with your contribute or interact with your contribute or interact with your upstream open-source providers? One, upstream open-source providers? One, upstream open-source providers? One, two, three, more than four, five. Five two, three, more than four, five. Five two, three, more than four, five. Five and a shaky hand. Neat. and a shaky hand. Neat. and a shaky hand. Neat. So, y'all got some work to do uh in So, y'all got some work to do uh in So, y'all got some work to do uh in trying to hit some of these timelines. trying to hit some of these timelines. trying to hit some of these timelines. And if you are exclusively dependent on And if you are exclusively dependent on And if you are exclusively dependent on a free and open- source upstream a free and open- source upstream a free and open- source upstream maintainer, you're going to need to maintainer, you're going to need to maintainer, you're going to need to figure some stuff figure some stuff figure some stuff out. Oh, uh got a question. out. Oh, uh got a question. out. Oh, uh got a question. I'll repeat. I'll repeat. I'll repeat. Manufacturers are working their own Manufacturers are working their own Manufacturers are working their own versions of source projects and then versions of source projects and then versions of source projects and then having discre open source projects and having discre open source projects and having discre open source projects and their ports and maybe arising on the their ports and maybe arising on the their ports and maybe arising on the ports that we never made aware is not. ports that we never made aware is not. ports that we never made aware is not. So um we do have a virtual audience. So, So um we do have a virtual audience. So, So um we do have a virtual audience. So, I'll repeat this question, but going I'll repeat this question, but going I'll repeat this question, but going forward, if you could use the mic, that forward, if you could use the mic, that forward, if you could use the mic, that would be helpful to our virtual would be helpful to our virtual would be helpful to our virtual attendees. But the TLDDR is ma a choice attendees. But the TLDDR is ma a choice attendees. But the TLDDR is ma a choice a manufacturer could make is if they a manufacturer could make is if they a manufacturer could make is if they don't have a good relationship with an don't have a good relationship with an don't have a good relationship with an upstream maintainer, they could fork upstream maintainer, they could fork upstream maintainer, they could fork that software and take on that that software and take on that that software and take on that engineering burden themselves and then engineering burden themselves and then engineering burden themselves and then eventually we're going to have a drift eventually we're going to have a drift eventually we're going to have a drift between what upstream and this these between what upstream and this these between what upstream and this these multiple forks potentially uh might have multiple forks potentially uh might have multiple forks potentially uh might have to try to implement a solution. So it's to try to implement a solution. So it's to try to implement a solution. So it's going to definitely cause uh confusion going to definitely cause uh confusion going to definitely cause uh confusion and some bifurcation around the and some bifurcation around the and some bifurcation around the ecosystem ecosystem ecosystem and I think actually that that ties into and I think actually that that ties into and I think actually that that ties into potentially how we can maybe fix that or potentially how we can maybe fix that or potentially how we can maybe fix that or at least uh stave off some of those at least uh stave off some of those at least uh stave off some of those issues. So in the open source right hey issues. So in the open source right hey issues. So in the open source right hey if open source is not responsible if open source is not responsible if open source is not responsible enterprises are enterprises are enterprises are responsible what do I do right um responsible what do I do right um responsible what do I do right um well have a better relationship with well have a better relationship with well have a better relationship with your open source uh the software that your open source uh the software that your open source uh the software that you're using right contribute back um you're using right contribute back um you're using right contribute back um you know provide resources provide money you know provide resources provide money you know provide resources provide money provide time etc to those folks also provide time etc to those folks also provide time etc to those folks also look long and hard at what you are using look long and hard at what you are using look long and hard at what you are using right uh how many folks here are aware right uh how many folks here are aware right uh how many folks here are aware that like you know that hey you probably that like you know that hey you probably that like you know that hey you probably if you used open SSH you were relying on if you used open SSH you were relying on if you used open SSH you were relying on XZ utils which for years and years and XZ utils which for years and years and XZ utils which for years and years and years maintained by one person right and years maintained by one person right and years maintained by one person right and how many of you work at regulated in how many of you work at regulated in how many of you work at regulated in regulated industries where if you were regulated industries where if you were regulated industries where if you were to go and tell your legal and compliance to go and tell your legal and compliance to go and tell your legal and compliance team oh yeah that software was written team oh yeah that software was written team oh yeah that software was written by one employee who we don't even know by one employee who we don't even know by one employee who we don't even know they would tell you what are you talking they would tell you what are you talking they would tell you what are you talking about stop immediately go and you know about stop immediately go and you know about stop immediately go and you know rewrite the software with no you known rewrite the software with no you known rewrite the software with no you known employees yada employees yada employees yada yada. Okay, so you understand a that a yada. Okay, so you understand a that a yada. Okay, so you understand a that a little bit more. But then hey, a lot of little bit more. But then hey, a lot of little bit more. But then hey, a lot of us all have that issue, right? A us all have that issue, right? A us all have that issue, right? A everybody here who's working at a everybody here who's working at a everybody here who's working at a regulated industry, you know, you all regulated industry, you know, you all regulated industry, you know, you all have the same sort of problems. So why have the same sort of problems. So why have the same sort of problems. So why should we all individually solve it? Why should we all individually solve it? Why should we all individually solve it? Why can't we start to work with for example can't we start to work with for example can't we start to work with for example these open source stewards like Eclipse these open source stewards like Eclipse these open source stewards like Eclipse Foundation, Linux Foundation and so on Foundation, Linux Foundation and so on Foundation, Linux Foundation and so on to maybe collaborate, contribute to maybe collaborate, contribute to maybe collaborate, contribute resources centrally, focus on fixing the resources centrally, focus on fixing the resources centrally, focus on fixing the open source software centrally, right? open source software centrally, right? open source software centrally, right? where the money and resources are where the money and resources are where the money and resources are collectively sort of pulled, the the collectively sort of pulled, the the collectively sort of pulled, the the communication collaboration is communication collaboration is communication collaboration is collectively pulled so that um when we collectively pulled so that um when we collectively pulled so that um when we start to address these uh start to address these uh start to address these uh vulnerabilities in open source, we don't vulnerabilities in open source, we don't vulnerabilities in open source, we don't have to fork, right? Because we can say, have to fork, right? Because we can say, have to fork, right? Because we can say, hey, as an example, lots of folks sell hey, as an example, lots of folks sell hey, as an example, lots of folks sell Kubernetes at some level, right? whether Kubernetes at some level, right? whether Kubernetes at some level, right? whether it's in the cloud, whether it's I'm it's in the cloud, whether it's I'm it's in the cloud, whether it's I'm shipping you an enterprise Kubernetes or shipping you an enterprise Kubernetes or shipping you an enterprise Kubernetes or I'm shipping you something that sits on I'm shipping you something that sits on I'm shipping you something that sits on top or top or top or whatever, we can all sort of work whatever, we can all sort of work whatever, we can all sort of work together to fix the vulnerability once, together to fix the vulnerability once, together to fix the vulnerability once, but by actually contributing the but by actually contributing the but by actually contributing the resources since we're, you know, the resources since we're, you know, the resources since we're, you know, the folks who are selling it, making the folks who are selling it, making the folks who are selling it, making the commercial benefit can all be sort of commercial benefit can all be sort of commercial benefit can all be sort of centralized in something like a steward. centralized in something like a steward. centralized in something like a steward. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. um forking the the the mentality behind um forking the the the mentality behind um forking the the the mentality behind I'm going to fork my open source project I'm going to fork my open source project I'm going to fork my open source project maintain it maintain it maintain it independently is stemming from this independently is stemming from this independently is stemming from this uh perception of software as long-term uh perception of software as long-term uh perception of software as long-term stable right u stable right u stable right u so if your software is like Windows so if your software is like Windows so if your software is like Windows where it's like hey every few years where it's like hey every few years where it's like hey every few years there's this big update um if I just there's this big update um if I just there's this big update um if I just copied that code over and maintained it copied that code over and maintained it copied that code over and maintained it myself. In 5 years, I might need to myself. In 5 years, I might need to myself. In 5 years, I might need to reync with that and get all the updates reync with that and get all the updates reync with that and get all the updates in. Uh something like Kubernetes is one in. Uh something like Kubernetes is one in. Uh something like Kubernetes is one of the slower rapid cadence projects, of the slower rapid cadence projects, of the slower rapid cadence projects, right? But it follows a rapid cadence. right? But it follows a rapid cadence. right? But it follows a rapid cadence. Um what is it? Is it three, four months? Um what is it? Is it three, four months? Um what is it? Is it three, four months? Every three months. uh every 3 months Every three months. uh every 3 months Every three months. uh every 3 months you're getting a new release of you're getting a new release of you're getting a new release of Kubernetes that's going to include um Kubernetes that's going to include um Kubernetes that's going to include um some new features, some security fixes, some new features, some security fixes, some new features, some security fixes, just all sorts of considerations that just all sorts of considerations that just all sorts of considerations that the open source community at large has the open source community at large has the open source community at large has found to be relevant and important to found to be relevant and important to found to be relevant and important to your use of the software. And so in a your use of the software. And so in a your use of the software. And so in a year you will have forked from four four year you will have forked from four four year you will have forked from four four versions. You'll be four versions behind versions. You'll be four versions behind versions. You'll be four versions behind in a year. Uh and so even though this is in a year. Uh and so even though this is in a year. Uh and so even though this is one of the most common practices, it's one of the most common practices, it's one of the most common practices, it's one of the most risky and one of the one of the most risky and one of the one of the most risky and one of the most costly. It is extremely expensive most costly. It is extremely expensive most costly. It is extremely expensive to maintain your own fork of something to maintain your own fork of something to maintain your own fork of something even if it's not as big as Kubernetes even if it's not as big as Kubernetes even if it's not as big as Kubernetes and it's extremely risky because of how and it's extremely risky because of how and it's extremely risky because of how fast the cadence of releases is all fast the cadence of releases is all fast the cadence of releases is all across the modern ecosystem. across the modern ecosystem. across the modern ecosystem. Looks like we have a question. There's Looks like we have a question. There's Looks like we have a question. There's an online question. Um could you an online question. Um could you an online question. Um could you recclarify your understanding of the recclarify your understanding of the recclarify your understanding of the 24-hour notification? Uh my reading is 24-hour notification? Uh my reading is 24-hour notification? Uh my reading is that it applies to exploited that it applies to exploited that it applies to exploited vulnerabilities not exploitables and vulnerabilities not exploitables and vulnerabilities not exploitables and security incidents uh which I read as security incidents uh which I read as security incidents uh which I read as server misconfigurations. I do not see server misconfigurations. I do not see server misconfigurations. I do not see mention of serious vulnerabilities in mention of serious vulnerabilities in mention of serious vulnerabilities in the text. So uh we had a whole day of the text. So uh we had a whole day of the text. So uh we had a whole day of talking about the CRA yesterday. So I talking about the CRA yesterday. So I talking about the CRA yesterday. So I can't possibly touch on every little can't possibly touch on every little can't possibly touch on every little bit. But if you look at the bit. But if you look at the bit. But if you look at the vulnerability management section, there vulnerability management section, there vulnerability management section, there are two things that manufacturers are are two things that manufacturers are are two things that manufacturers are responsible for. When there is a known responsible for. When there is a known responsible for. When there is a known exploited vulnerability, that's the exploited vulnerability, that's the exploited vulnerability, that's the fasttrack. And then when there is a fasttrack. And then when there is a fasttrack. And then when there is a severe vulnerability, severe vulnerability, severe vulnerability, um, which is typically just a regular um, which is typically just a regular um, which is typically just a regular van that impacts CIA and had it touches van that impacts CIA and had it touches van that impacts CIA and had it touches on like PII, PHI, sensitive information. on like PII, PHI, sensitive information. on like PII, PHI, sensitive information. Those are the two paths that Those are the two paths that Those are the two paths that manufacturers and stewards are obliged manufacturers and stewards are obliged manufacturers and stewards are obliged to uh take action on. So it is in there. to uh take action on. So it is in there. to uh take action on. So it is in there. Um it'll be annex one will give you the Um it'll be annex one will give you the Um it'll be annex one will give you the kind of checklist and I can't recall kind of checklist and I can't recall kind of checklist and I can't recall which section. It might be article 14 I which section. It might be article 14 I which section. It might be article 14 I think might have the bond management think might have the bond management think might have the bond management piece but it it is in there. Uh this is piece but it it is in there. Uh this is piece but it it is in there. Uh this is a point to remind everybody of the a point to remind everybody of the a point to remind everybody of the dates, right? So middle of next year, dates, right? So middle of next year, dates, right? So middle of next year, we're going to have a lot more clarity we're going to have a lot more clarity we're going to have a lot more clarity locked in around the details of like locked in around the details of like locked in around the details of like what is going to be measured and end of what is going to be measured and end of what is going to be measured and end of next year, December 11th, 2026, uh is next year, December 11th, 2026, uh is next year, December 11th, 2026, uh is when we're going to have our reporting when we're going to have our reporting when we're going to have our reporting requirements. So full effect happens in requirements. So full effect happens in requirements. So full effect happens in at the end of 2027 when there's the long at the end of 2027 when there's the long at the end of 2027 when there's the long list of regulated, you know, activities, list of regulated, you know, activities, list of regulated, you know, activities, but at the end of next year, we are but at the end of next year, we are but at the end of next year, we are going to have reporting requirements going to have reporting requirements going to have reporting requirements that are going to be uh in place. So, that are going to be uh in place. So, that are going to be uh in place. So, I'm going to poll the audience here of I'm going to poll the audience here of I'm going to poll the audience here of the manufacturers. How many of you know the manufacturers. How many of you know the manufacturers. How many of you know the top 10 most used or what you feel the top 10 most used or what you feel the top 10 most used or what you feel are the most critical open- source are the most critical open- source are the most critical open- source projects you use in your portfolio? portfolio? portfolio? Neat. You all better start getting some Neat. You all better start getting some Neat. You all better start getting some lists together because you'll be lists together because you'll be lists together because you'll be responsible for everything, not just the responsible for everything, not just the responsible for everything, not just the top 10. Yeah. So I would recommend start top 10. Yeah. So I would recommend start top 10. Yeah. So I would recommend start off small and uh grow from there. So off small and uh grow from there. So off small and uh grow from there. So let's move on. So we we have some let's move on. So we we have some let's move on. So we we have some solutions here to help both up and solutions here to help both up and solutions here to help both up and downstream. So let's talk about this downstream. So let's talk about this downstream. So let's talk about this opensource project security baseline. opensource project security baseline. opensource project security baseline. How does that help? How does that help? How does that help? You really put some drama on on the name You really put some drama on on the name You really put some drama on on the name there. What is up with that? Yeah. Well, there. What is up with that? Yeah. Well, there. What is up with that? Yeah. Well, keep the question up. I'll keep the keep the question up. I'll keep the keep the question up. I'll keep the question up. Um so open source project question up. Um so open source project question up. Um so open source project security baseline is uh the most security baseline is uh the most security baseline is uh the most descriptive name we could possibly think descriptive name we could possibly think descriptive name we could possibly think of. It results in Cro going around in my of. It results in Cro going around in my of. It results in Cro going around in my ear saying opus opus opus. ear saying opus opus opus. ear saying opus opus opus. Yeah. OPS baseline. Uh the intent behind Yeah. OPS baseline. Uh the intent behind Yeah. OPS baseline. Uh the intent behind this is to uh interview as many this is to uh interview as many this is to uh interview as many maintainers and stewards as possible to maintainers and stewards as possible to maintainers and stewards as possible to come up with a a set of requirements come up with a a set of requirements come up with a a set of requirements that are are very very clearly stated. that are are very very clearly stated. that are are very very clearly stated. uh when something is true then some uh when something is true then some uh when something is true then some actor must perform some action right uh actor must perform some action right uh actor must perform some action right uh so just very clearly stating so just very clearly stating so just very clearly stating expectations for open source projects uh expectations for open source projects uh expectations for open source projects uh we believe that this is uh we have we believe that this is uh we have we believe that this is uh we have defined a core minimum that should be defined a core minimum that should be defined a core minimum that should be true for all open source projects uh true for all open source projects uh true for all open source projects uh this is a very recent thing so it's this is a very recent thing so it's this is a very recent thing so it's still taking feedback taking input uh still taking feedback taking input uh still taking feedback taking input uh but within the baseline we've also got but within the baseline we've also got but within the baseline we've also got uh maturity levels two and three which uh maturity levels two and three which uh maturity levels two and three which are for stretch goals so the Linux are for stretch goals so the Linux are for stretch goals so the Linux foundation has maturity levels where we foundation has maturity levels where we foundation has maturity levels where we in as stewards can hold projects to a in as stewards can hold projects to a in as stewards can hold projects to a higher level of accountability. Uh and higher level of accountability. Uh and higher level of accountability. Uh and so we have those stretch goals built so we have those stretch goals built so we have those stretch goals built into the baseline as well. Uh and you into the baseline as well. Uh and you into the baseline as well. Uh and you guys Yeah. So the the baseline catalog guys Yeah. So the the baseline catalog guys Yeah. So the the baseline catalog which is the brains of the whole project which is the brains of the whole project which is the brains of the whole project is a series of 41 requirements and as is a series of 41 requirements and as is a series of 41 requirements and as Eddie said they're broken up into three Eddie said they're broken up into three Eddie said they're broken up into three levels of maturity. Level one we think levels of maturity. Level one we think levels of maturity. Level one we think should be achievable by a single should be achievable by a single should be achievable by a single maintainer project. maintainer project. maintainer project. How we got those requirements was How we got those requirements was How we got those requirements was combing through things like the NIST combing through things like the NIST combing through things like the NIST cyber security framework. Um the secure cyber security framework. Um the secure cyber security framework. Um the secure software development framework uh things software development framework uh things software development framework uh things like uh open chain the CRA we did like uh open chain the CRA we did like uh open chain the CRA we did alignment we did a mapping of the CRA alignment we did a mapping of the CRA alignment we did a mapping of the CRA requirements. So out of annex one there requirements. So out of annex one there requirements. So out of annex one there are 21 requirements and if you follow are 21 requirements and if you follow are 21 requirements and if you follow the baseline and have evidence of all the baseline and have evidence of all the baseline and have evidence of all those practices we feel that you have those practices we feel that you have those practices we feel that you have legs to stand on for 19 out of those 21 legs to stand on for 19 out of those 21 legs to stand on for 19 out of those 21 requirements. We don't cover things like requirements. We don't cover things like requirements. We don't cover things like around um handling of sensitive data or around um handling of sensitive data or around um handling of sensitive data or removing user data from a system because removing user data from a system because removing user data from a system because upstream is really about the software upstream is really about the software upstream is really about the software the project. They're not really about a the project. They're not really about a the project. They're not really about a solution. So, sorry manufacturers, you solution. So, sorry manufacturers, you solution. So, sorry manufacturers, you have two extra things you have to do, have two extra things you have to do, have two extra things you have to do, but you had to do that anyway. But, uh, but you had to do that anyway. But, uh, but you had to do that anyway. But, uh, let's just talk about the baseline. let's just talk about the baseline. let's just talk about the baseline. Yeah. Um, so what's kind of great about Yeah. Um, so what's kind of great about Yeah. Um, so what's kind of great about the baseline the baseline the baseline is even though it's focused on the is even though it's focused on the is even though it's focused on the upstream open source projects to follow, upstream open source projects to follow, upstream open source projects to follow, right? Think of it as hey right? Think of it as hey right? Think of it as hey um what can a maintainer be doing um what can a maintainer be doing um what can a maintainer be doing whether they're a single maintainer or whether they're a single maintainer or whether they're a single maintainer or underneath the Linux foundation underneath the Linux foundation underneath the Linux foundation something like a CNCF project an open something like a CNCF project an open something like a CNCF project an open SSF project what can they be doing to SSF project what can they be doing to SSF project what can they be doing to sort sort sort of do reasonable sort of security things of do reasonable sort of security things of do reasonable sort of security things so that their downstream consumers right so that their downstream consumers right so that their downstream consumers right who are using this potentially in their who are using this potentially in their who are using this potentially in their products or maybe not even in their products or maybe not even in their products or maybe not even in their products can feel safe right even though products can feel safe right even though products can feel safe right even though we're talking obviously about the CRA we we're talking obviously about the CRA we we're talking obviously about the CRA we also think that the baseline is just also think that the baseline is just also think that the baseline is just good security practice. So that even if good security practice. So that even if good security practice. So that even if you're not selling a thing, hey, we're, you're not selling a thing, hey, we're, you're not selling a thing, hey, we're, you know, I'm I like my open source you know, I'm I like my open source you know, I'm I like my open source project to be secure. Well, follow some project to be secure. Well, follow some project to be secure. Well, follow some of these practices. of these practices. of these practices. Um, so it's includes things like uh some Um, so it's includes things like uh some Um, so it's includes things like uh some of it is very very simple like have of it is very very simple like have of it is very very simple like have security documentation for your project. security documentation for your project. security documentation for your project. Even if the security documentation is Even if the security documentation is Even if the security documentation is this project is not secure please do not this project is not secure please do not this project is not secure please do not use it for security sensitive uh use it for security sensitive uh use it for security sensitive uh applications well as a downstream applications well as a downstream applications well as a downstream consumer I want to know that right I I consumer I want to know that right I I consumer I want to know that right I I don't like want you know a lot of times don't like want you know a lot of times don't like want you know a lot of times I look at a project and I go wow it has I look at a project and I go wow it has I look at a project and I go wow it has a lot of stars but then you find out a lot of stars but then you find out a lot of stars but then you find out that it was you know it was on hacker that it was you know it was on hacker that it was you know it was on hacker news it got thousands upon thousands of news it got thousands upon thousands of news it got thousands upon thousands of stars it was somebody's like sort of stars it was somebody's like sort of stars it was somebody's like sort of weekend project it's really cool but the weekend project it's really cool but the weekend project it's really cool but the person is just like yeah no I I I just person is just like yeah no I I I just person is just like yeah no I I I just kind of hacked on a thing for a weekend kind of hacked on a thing for a weekend kind of hacked on a thing for a weekend and then sort of let it kind of do it and then sort of let it kind of do it and then sort of let it kind of do it you know let it go. Um the baseline you know let it go. Um the baseline you know let it go. Um the baseline really sort of helps with first getting really sort of helps with first getting really sort of helps with first getting folks to understand what is the project folks to understand what is the project folks to understand what is the project in the first place who do I contact if I in the first place who do I contact if I in the first place who do I contact if I do have an issue and the again given do have an issue and the again given do have an issue and the again given that it is open source the answer can be that it is open source the answer can be that it is open source the answer can be hey if there's any vulnerabilities not hey if there's any vulnerabilities not hey if there's any vulnerabilities not my problem right but even just having my problem right but even just having my problem right but even just having that you can go and say hey I don't want that you can go and say hey I don't want that you can go and say hey I don't want to include the not my problem um in to include the not my problem um in to include the not my problem um in inside of uh uh you know my my software inside of uh uh you know my my software inside of uh uh you know my my software that I'm delivering to my customers um that I'm delivering to my customers um that I'm delivering to my customers um and then Uh yeah and and what we're and then Uh yeah and and what we're and then Uh yeah and and what we're doing is uh obviously our first and doing is uh obviously our first and doing is uh obviously our first and largest target was the CRA that's the largest target was the CRA that's the largest target was the CRA that's the most present thing but our intention is most present thing but our intention is most present thing but our intention is to go across other cyber security to go across other cyber security to go across other cyber security frameworks like um 853 161 uh doing frameworks like um 853 161 uh doing frameworks like um 853 161 uh doing looking at things like uh Fed ramp kind looking at things like uh Fed ramp kind looking at things like uh Fed ramp kind of how we line up with Fed ramp of how we line up with Fed ramp of how we line up with Fed ramp requirements but we're going to march requirements but we're going to march requirements but we're going to march our way around the world and basically our way around the world and basically our way around the world and basically show if you do um show if you do um show if you do um OSPSLE1 if you're compliant with that OSPSLE1 if you're compliant with that OSPSLE1 if you're compliant with that you also get gold stars with you also get gold stars with you also get gold stars with PCIDSS and you know the White House PCIDSS and you know the White House PCIDSS and you know the White House requirement that you have an SSDF requirement that you have an SSDF requirement that you have an SSDF attestation. So we're going to go attestation. So we're going to go attestation. So we're going to go through and show you where you do the through and show you where you do the through and show you where you do the compliance once and how it's applicable compliance once and how it's applicable compliance once and how it's applicable in other frameworks and legislative in other frameworks and legislative in other frameworks and legislative organizations. Does anybody do control organizations. Does anybody do control organizations. Does anybody do control mappings like in your day job ever? mappings like in your day job ever? mappings like in your day job ever? Okay. Um patch is welcome. Crob needs Okay. Um patch is welcome. Crob needs Okay. Um patch is welcome. Crob needs help. KB's been going through where help. KB's been going through where help. KB's been going through where we've like compiled a list of the like, we've like compiled a list of the like, we've like compiled a list of the like, hey, this is this is what it means to hey, this is this is what it means to hey, this is this is what it means to lock down open source projects and KB's lock down open source projects and KB's lock down open source projects and KB's been going through and he has a massive been going through and he has a massive been going through and he has a massive crosswalk of all those things he was crosswalk of all those things he was crosswalk of all those things he was just talking about. Um, it's extremely just talking about. Um, it's extremely just talking about. Um, it's extremely helpful, but there's not a lot of people helpful, but there's not a lot of people helpful, but there's not a lot of people who have that skill set to be able to do who have that skill set to be able to do who have that skill set to be able to do those mappings. Uh, so so good job. those mappings. Uh, so so good job. those mappings. Uh, so so good job. Patch is Patch is Patch is welcome and somebody come help this man. welcome and somebody come help this man. welcome and somebody come help this man. Well, and and looking at it, the the gap Well, and and looking at it, the the gap Well, and and looking at it, the the gap I feel that baseline fills, unlike I feel that baseline fills, unlike I feel that baseline fills, unlike things like 853 or even the the secure things like 853 or even the the secure things like 853 or even the the secure software development framework, those software development framework, those software development framework, those are focused on enterprise operations. are focused on enterprise operations. are focused on enterprise operations. Yep. So, a bank or a retailer um or even Yep. So, a bank or a retailer um or even Yep. So, a bank or a retailer um or even maybe a government agency. So, those maybe a government agency. So, those maybe a government agency. So, those frameworks are really operationally frameworks are really operationally frameworks are really operationally focused. So, do you have guards with focused. So, do you have guards with focused. So, do you have guards with guns and dogs and cameras? Do you have guns and dogs and cameras? Do you have guns and dogs and cameras? Do you have an HR team? You know, does your CISO an HR team? You know, does your CISO an HR team? You know, does your CISO report to the board once a year? These report to the board once a year? These report to the board once a year? These are concepts that don't exist upstream. are concepts that don't exist upstream. are concepts that don't exist upstream. And even the SSDF, while is a better And even the SSDF, while is a better And even the SSDF, while is a better step forward, it does talk about step forward, it does talk about step forward, it does talk about development practices, it doesn't really development practices, it doesn't really development practices, it doesn't really dig deep into how modern software is dig deep into how modern software is dig deep into how modern software is developed and the collaborative nature developed and the collaborative nature developed and the collaborative nature of open source and how downstream consu of open source and how downstream consu of open source and how downstream consu consumes it and composes it into their consumes it and composes it into their consumes it and composes it into their products. And we feel that it's fairly products. And we feel that it's fairly products. And we feel that it's fairly holistic. We have a lot of things around holistic. We have a lot of things around holistic. We have a lot of things around how the software is developed, how that how the software is developed, how that how the software is developed, how that software is compiled, built and software is compiled, built and software is compiled, built and distributed. And then we also have distributed. And then we also have distributed. And then we also have guidance on how things should be guidance on how things should be guidance on how things should be consumed and maintained. So we feel it's consumed and maintained. So we feel it's consumed and maintained. So we feel it's fairly comprehensive, not perfect, but fairly comprehensive, not perfect, but fairly comprehensive, not perfect, but uh I think it's a step forward as uh I think it's a step forward as uh I think it's a step forward as opposed to I just follow NIST 853. opposed to I just follow NIST 853. opposed to I just follow NIST 853. Yeah. Good luck with those cameras. And Yeah. Good luck with those cameras. And Yeah. Good luck with those cameras. And and some of the stuff in in NIST 853 and and some of the stuff in in NIST 853 and and some of the stuff in in NIST 853 and and similar like just and similar like just and similar like just you can't do open source in that way. you can't do open source in that way. you can't do open source in that way. It's just like some of the things around It's just like some of the things around It's just like some of the things around having certain types of protections of having certain types of protections of having certain types of protections of who's allowed to see the source code and who's allowed to see the source code and who's allowed to see the source code and stuff like that. It's like it's open stuff like that. It's like it's open stuff like that. It's like it's open source, the world can see it. Oh no, source, the world can see it. Oh no, source, the world can see it. Oh no, they stole your source code. Yeah. Um they stole your source code. Yeah. Um they stole your source code. Yeah. Um and and so when it comes to sort of open and and so when it comes to sort of open and and so when it comes to sort of open source uh there's you know even with source uh there's you know even with source uh there's you know even with that said though there's a lot of stuff that said though there's a lot of stuff that said though there's a lot of stuff that I feel like you know that we all that I feel like you know that we all that I feel like you know that we all feel like open source feel like open source feel like open source maintainers it's very very uh low effort maintainers it's very very uh low effort maintainers it's very very uh low effort to say hey let's enable MFA so that if to say hey let's enable MFA so that if to say hey let's enable MFA so that if somebody steals your GitHub credentials somebody steals your GitHub credentials somebody steals your GitHub credentials they don't push out malicious source and they don't push out malicious source and they don't push out malicious source and then all your downstream consumers kind then all your downstream consumers kind then all your downstream consumers kind of uh do that and it's like it's very of uh do that and it's like it's very of uh do that and it's like it's very low touch and then even if you don't low touch and then even if you don't low touch and then even if you don't care about folks who are downstream care about folks who are downstream care about folks who are downstream your own reputation is probably worth a your own reputation is probably worth a your own reputation is probably worth a little bit of something. Like you don't little bit of something. Like you don't little bit of something. Like you don't want folks to just be like, I don't want want folks to just be like, I don't want want folks to just be like, I don't want to work with that person because they to work with that person because they to work with that person because they just don't even do the bare minimum for just don't even do the bare minimum for just don't even do the bare minimum for security. Yeah. Um so changing changing security. Yeah. Um so changing changing security. Yeah. Um so changing changing topics back uh zooming up to CRA topics. topics back uh zooming up to CRA topics. topics back uh zooming up to CRA topics. um as somebody who's a little bit more um as somebody who's a little bit more um as somebody who's a little bit more focused on security like practitioner focused on security like practitioner focused on security like practitioner level security development that kind of level security development that kind of level security development that kind of stuff um there's a document that you are stuff um there's a document that you are stuff um there's a document that you are a contributor to uh the OC related stuff a contributor to uh the OC related stuff a contributor to uh the OC related stuff um that has been actually really helpful um that has been actually really helpful um that has been actually really helpful on navigating this or kind of bridging on navigating this or kind of bridging on navigating this or kind of bridging uh these compliance topics but then uh these compliance topics but then uh these compliance topics but then bringing it like real world with like bringing it like real world with like bringing it like real world with like hey here's where you can find more hey here's where you can find more hey here's where you can find more information the actionable stuff Um can information the actionable stuff Um can information the actionable stuff Um can you talk a little bit about that? Um so you talk a little bit about that? Um so you talk a little bit about that? Um so the CRA the law itself is done and we're the CRA the law itself is done and we're the CRA the law itself is done and we're in a period now where they are working in a period now where they are working in a period now where they are working on amendments. So there will be some on amendments. So there will be some on amendments. So there will be some slight changes here and there some term slight changes here and there some term slight changes here and there some term clarification and definition. But the clarification and definition. But the clarification and definition. But the other major work stream is um other major work stream is um other major work stream is um standardization where uh the European standardization where uh the European standardization where uh the European Commission would like to wherever they Commission would like to wherever they Commission would like to wherever they have a requirement they would like to have a requirement they would like to have a requirement they would like to point somebody to an internationally point somebody to an internationally point somebody to an internationally adopted best practice and standard and adopted best practice and standard and adopted best practice and standard and say this is how you should do this. This say this is how you should do this. This say this is how you should do this. This is the model of how this happens. And is the model of how this happens. And is the model of how this happens. And like Eddie mentioned, ORC has a great like Eddie mentioned, ORC has a great like Eddie mentioned, ORC has a great repository that's talked about a lot of repository that's talked about a lot of repository that's talked about a lot of these frameworks. um PERT services these frameworks. um PERT services these frameworks. um PERT services frameworks in there now. frameworks in there now. frameworks in there now. Y um but you know things like that. This Y um but you know things like that. This Y um but you know things like that. This is how a product security team should is how a product security team should is how a product security team should work or this is how um coordinated work or this is how um coordinated work or this is how um coordinated vulnerability disclosure it kind of vulnerability disclosure it kind of vulnerability disclosure it kind of models for that and the commission models for that and the commission models for that and the commission through a couple different bodies. Um through a couple different bodies. Um through a couple different bodies. Um there are three bodies that I'm aware there are three bodies that I'm aware there are three bodies that I'm aware of. um Etsy standardization um Senselac of. um Etsy standardization um Senselac of. um Etsy standardization um Senselac for standardization and then we have a for standardization and then we have a for standardization and then we have a uh a special group called the expert uh a special group called the expert uh a special group called the expert group which is an invite only uh list of group which is an invite only uh list of group which is an invite only uh list of folks um predominantly European uh cyber folks um predominantly European uh cyber folks um predominantly European uh cyber security experts but then there's also a security experts but then there's also a security experts but then there's also a special category for liaons and that's special category for liaons and that's special category for liaons and that's where um foundations have the ability to where um foundations have the ability to where um foundations have the ability to contribute and Eclipse and the Linux contribute and Eclipse and the Linux contribute and Eclipse and the Linux foundation open SSF are both foundation open SSF are both foundation open SSF are both participating in this group and that's participating in this group and that's participating in this group and that's where we kind of have a direct pipeline where we kind of have a direct pipeline where we kind of have a direct pipeline to the commission and ENISA and other to the commission and ENISA and other to the commission and ENISA and other folks related to this as these things folks related to this as these things folks related to this as these things get worked out. But it's uh very complex get worked out. But it's uh very complex get worked out. But it's uh very complex what's going on. Uh a lots of the what's going on. Uh a lots of the what's going on. Uh a lots of the Senelac standardization stream is Senelac standardization stream is Senelac standardization stream is potentially 41 different standards. So potentially 41 different standards. So potentially 41 different standards. So it's a a lot of lot of meetings and it's a a lot of lot of meetings and it's a a lot of lot of meetings and talking and trying to identify this talking and trying to identify this talking and trying to identify this stuff. So uh for those taking notes or stuff. So uh for those taking notes or stuff. So uh for those taking notes or googling um where can we find that those googling um where can we find that those googling um where can we find that those resources? Um I I don't have that in resources? Um I I don't have that in resources? Um I I don't have that in this presentation. I did a presentation this presentation. I did a presentation this presentation. I did a presentation yesterday. What should we Google? Um yesterday. What should we Google? Um yesterday. What should we Google? Um well my presentation's on GitHub right well my presentation's on GitHub right well my presentation's on GitHub right now yesterday and I have a slide where I now yesterday and I have a slide where I now yesterday and I have a slide where I link to the European Commission uh where link to the European Commission uh where link to the European Commission uh where the expert group has their meeting the expert group has their meeting the expert group has their meeting notes. So I'll be glad to provide that notes. So I'll be glad to provide that notes. So I'll be glad to provide that uh later. But if you're bored and you uh later. But if you're bored and you uh later. But if you're bored and you have a device, you can go to GitHub and have a device, you can go to GitHub and have a device, you can go to GitHub and look at security probe presentations and look at security probe presentations and look at security probe presentations and look for um PERT tlddr was a pertldr was look for um PERT tlddr was a pertldr was look for um PERT tlddr was a pertldr was the name of the presentation. I have a the name of the presentation. I have a the name of the presentation. I have a slide in there that gives you links to slide in there that gives you links to slide in there that gives you links to those resources though we didn't prepare those resources though we didn't prepare those resources though we didn't prepare that today. that today. that today. Sorry. That's all right. Yes. Yes. Yes. Oh, Oh, Oh, Cro brought words. I did bring words. Cro brought words. I did bring words. Cro brought words. I did bring words. So article 64 talks about the So article 64 talks about the So article 64 talks about the consequences for manufacturers of consequences for manufacturers of consequences for manufacturers of non-compliance. Um I added highlighting non-compliance. Um I added highlighting non-compliance. Um I added highlighting but wherever possible I try to use the but wherever possible I try to use the but wherever possible I try to use the exact words that the legislators used exact words that the legislators used exact words that the legislators used but uh this is from article 64 uh item but uh this is from article 64 uh item but uh this is from article 64 uh item 34 and uh 2 three and four that talks 34 and uh 2 three and four that talks 34 and uh 2 three and four that talks about the consequences for a about the consequences for a about the consequences for a manufacturer. So, if you are manufacturer. So, if you are manufacturer. So, if you are non-compliant with the requirements, you non-compliant with the requirements, you non-compliant with the requirements, you potentially get to pay up to two and a potentially get to pay up to two and a potentially get to pay up to two and a half percent of your of your revenue half percent of your of your revenue half percent of your of your revenue from last year. Your uh the term is your from last year. Your uh the term is your from last year. Your uh the term is your total worldwide annual turnover for each total worldwide annual turnover for each total worldwide annual turnover for each incident. Uh and this is very similar incident. Uh and this is very similar incident. Uh and this is very similar anyone's gone through GDPR. Uh if you anyone's gone through GDPR. Uh if you anyone's gone through GDPR. Uh if you are non-compliant with obligations in are non-compliant with obligations in are non-compliant with obligations in article 14, 23, 28, 31, 32, article 14, 23, 28, 31, 32, article 14, 23, 28, 31, 32, uh 33 and 39 and 41, 47, 48, uh 49, and uh 33 and 39 and 41, 47, 48, uh 49, and uh 33 and 39 and 41, 47, 48, uh 49, and 53, you potentially could pay up to 2% 53, you potentially could pay up to 2% 53, you potentially could pay up to 2% of your last year's global total of your last year's global total of your last year's global total revenue. And then if you are found to be revenue. And then if you are found to be revenue. And then if you are found to be supplying incorrect, incomplete or supplying incorrect, incomplete or supplying incorrect, incomplete or misleading information, if they think misleading information, if they think misleading information, if they think you are lying to them or you are you are lying to them or you are you are lying to them or you are incompetent and gave the wrong incompetent and gave the wrong incompetent and gave the wrong information, that's just a 1% of all of information, that's just a 1% of all of information, that's just a 1% of all of your last year's revenue last year's uh your last year's revenue last year's uh your last year's revenue last year's uh global turnover uh for each incident. global turnover uh for each incident. global turnover uh for each incident. So the stakes are very high here. And So the stakes are very high here. And So the stakes are very high here. And remember upstream and stewards, we can remember upstream and stewards, we can remember upstream and stewards, we can help, but we're not required to do help, but we're not required to do help, but we're not required to do anything. This is all on you folks that anything. This is all on you folks that anything. This is all on you folks that sold a thing for money that used someone sold a thing for money that used someone sold a thing for money that used someone else's ideas. Yeah. And it's uh probably else's ideas. Yeah. And it's uh probably else's ideas. Yeah. And it's uh probably worthwhile to sort of highlight, you worthwhile to sort of highlight, you worthwhile to sort of highlight, you know, um automotive, medical devices, know, um automotive, medical devices, know, um automotive, medical devices, those sorts of folks, they're already those sorts of folks, they're already those sorts of folks, they're already doing this.

But a lot of other major about this." But a lot of other major about this." But a lot of other major sort of industries, um, telco, for sort of industries, um, telco, for sort of industries, um, telco, for example, this is new to them. And, uh, example, this is new to them. And, uh, example, this is new to them. And, uh, if you look at the annual turnover of if you look at the annual turnover of if you look at the annual turnover of some of those companies, we're talking some of those companies, we're talking some of those companies, we're talking like half a billion dollars. Uh, like half a billion dollars. Uh, like half a billion dollars. Uh, potentially. Euros, sir. Sorry. Euros. potentially. Euros, sir. Sorry. Euros. potentially. Euros, sir. Sorry. Euros. Yes. Yes.

And Big deal. It's a very big deal. And again from our research the some of the again from our research the some of the again from our research the some of the top concerns we heard from manufacturers top concerns we heard from manufacturers top concerns we heard from manufacturers is there's a lot of legal complexity and is there's a lot of legal complexity and is there's a lot of legal complexity and you know they they want to help ensure you know they they want to help ensure you know they they want to help ensure the safety of their components from the safety of their components from the safety of their components from their upstream suppliers but a lot of their upstream suppliers but a lot of their upstream suppliers but a lot of folks don't know how they they are very folks don't know how they they are very folks don't know how they they are very uh early on in their journey of uh early on in their journey of uh early on in their journey of effectively engaging upstream. So let's start by trying to upstream. So let's start by trying to upstream. So let's start by trying to make some people aware. So, thinking make some people aware. So, thinking make some people aware. So, thinking about about about You think we're done? You think we're You think we're done? You think we're You think we're done? You think we're No, no, we got 10 minutes. We got 10 No, no, we got 10 minutes. We got 10 No, no, we got 10 minutes. We got 10 minutes for Q&amp;A. All right. Well, let's minutes for Q&amp;A.

So the I'll kind of go in reverse order. So the I'll kind of go in reverse order. So the CRA talks about uh there are critical CRA talks about uh there are critical CRA talks about uh there are critical projects. So that includes products projects. So that includes products projects. So that includes products products yes sorry critical products products yes sorry critical products products yes sorry critical products which are considered things like hard which are considered things like hard which are considered things like hard certain hardware security devices that certain hardware security devices that certain hardware security devices that sort of stuff they have third-party sort of stuff they have third-party sort of stuff they have third-party conformance assessments that need to be conformance assessments that need to be conformance assessments that need to be performed um they are under very very performed um they are under very very performed um they are under very very very strict rules right hence hardware very strict rules right hence hardware very strict rules right hence hardware security devices that sort of thing um security devices that sort of thing um security devices that sort of thing um then there is important but of course then there is important but of course then there is important but of course this stuff is simple so important has to this stuff is simple so important has to this stuff is simple so important has to be split up into two subcategories uh be split up into two subcategories uh be split up into two subcategories uh you have type one and type you have type one and type you have type one and type type two which also requires a third type two which also requires a third type two which also requires a third party conformance assessment but maybe a party conformance assessment but maybe a party conformance assessment but maybe a little less strict little less strict little less strict um includes things like container um includes things like container um includes things like container orchestrators. So Kubernetes been orchestrators. So Kubernetes been orchestrators. So Kubernetes been talking about that a lot. That's under talking about that a lot. That's under talking about that a lot. That's under there. And then you have type one which there. And then you have type one which there. And then you have type one which um counterintuitively at least as of um counterintuitively at least as of um counterintuitively at least as of right now contains things like operating right now contains things like operating right now contains things like operating systems which why is operating systems systems which why is operating systems systems which why is operating systems considered less of a but whatever.

Um th those things uh do have uh uh security those things uh do have uh uh security those things uh do have uh uh security assessments but you can self assess. Um assessments but you can self assess. Um assessments but you can self assess. Um you still need to follow a what do they you still need to follow a what do they you still need to follow a what do they call it in in there? It's like you have call it in in there? It's like you have call it in in there? It's like you have to follow a a European standard I to follow a a European standard I to follow a a European standard I believe or something an identified believe or something an identified believe or something an identified standard. standard. standard.

And in the bucket of everything else, um pretty much it's just, you else, um pretty much it's just, you else, um pretty much it's just, you know, you you have to be doing know, you you have to be doing know, you you have to be doing reasonable things. You have to self reasonable things. You have to self reasonable things. You have to self assess. There are still certain assess. There are still certain assess. There are still certain requirements that you still have that requirements that you still have that requirements that you still have that are that are strict, but for the most are that are strict, but for the most are that are strict, but for the most part, you need to essentially sort of part, you need to essentially sort of part, you need to essentially sort of confirm like, yeah, I'm doing reasonable confirm like, yeah, I'm doing reasonable confirm like, yeah, I'm doing reasonable security things and if somebody suspects security things and if somebody suspects security things and if somebody suspects something that, you know, yes, they can something that, you know, yes, they can something that, you know, yes, they can go and and look at an audit and that, go and and look at an audit and that, go and and look at an audit and that, you know, request an audit and that sort you know, request an audit and that sort you know, request an audit and that sort of thing. But um so again all software of thing. But um so again all software of thing. But um so again all software hardware products with digital elements hardware products with digital elements hardware products with digital elements as I say uh falls under it and again as I say uh falls under it and again as I say uh falls under it and again with a little bit of an asterisk on SAS. Trying to see if we have while I'm SAS. Trying to see if we have while I'm SAS. Trying to see if we have while I'm waiting for people to queue up at the waiting for people to queue up at the waiting for people to queue up at the microphone or on Discord I'm seeing if microphone or on Discord I'm seeing if microphone or on Discord I'm seeing if we have any interesting things we wanted we have any interesting things we wanted we have any interesting things we wanted to touch on. Here's that compliance crosswalk we on. Here's that compliance crosswalk we on. Here's that compliance crosswalk we talked about. It's a publicly available talked about. It's a publicly available talked about. It's a publicly available document. It is integrated inside the document. It is integrated inside the document. It is integrated inside the baseline catalog for each of the baseline catalog for each of the baseline catalog for each of the individual controls. But if you are a individual controls. But if you are a individual controls. But if you are a governance, risk, and compliance wonk governance, risk, and compliance wonk governance, risk, and compliance wonk like me, you like spreadsheets. And so like me, you like spreadsheets. And so like me, you like spreadsheets. And so we've kind of put it in a spreadsheet. I we've kind of put it in a spreadsheet. I we've kind of put it in a spreadsheet. I am working my way through mapping to am working my way through mapping to am working my way through mapping to PCIDSS4 right now and a another model PCIDSS4 right now and a another model PCIDSS4 right now and a another model called PCR. And then I'll eventually do called PCR. And then I'll eventually do called PCR. And then I'll eventually do Dora N 2. Um and then I'll get into the Dora N 2. Um and then I'll get into the Dora N 2. Um and then I'll get into the AI laws. Uh there's a some is an AI laws. Uh there's a some is an AI laws. Uh there's a some is an executive order here. There is a law executive order here. There is a law executive order here. There is a law over in Europe and many nations around over in Europe and many nations around over in Europe and many nations around the globe. If they don't have a CRA like the globe. If they don't have a CRA like the globe. If they don't have a CRA like thing, they are planning it. We're aware thing, they are planning it. We're aware thing, they are planning it. We're aware of uh China and India and Britain all of uh China and India and Britain all of uh China and India and Britain all planning on doing something similar and planning on doing something similar and planning on doing something similar and you know the word they might not say you know the word they might not say you know the word they might not say product with digital elements but it product with digital elements but it product with digital elements but it they might use different terms but the they might use different terms but the they might use different terms but the heart of it is going to be kind of the heart of it is going to be kind of the heart of it is going to be kind of the same. What's your secure software same. What's your secure software same. What's your secure software development practices? How are you development practices? How are you development practices? How are you managing and informing people about managing and informing people about managing and informing people about vulnerabilities? Wait, everybody please clap for Male Wait, everybody please clap for Male Wait, everybody please clap for Male whether you know who he is or not. Thank you. That makes the thing much Thank you. That makes the thing much Thank you. That makes the thing much easier. Um, so this mapping is great. Um easier. Um, so this mapping is great. Um easier. Um, so this mapping is great. Um I I had a question about uh how do you I I had a question about uh how do you I I had a question about uh how do you feel about the the completeness of the feel about the the completeness of the feel about the the completeness of the mapping or when you said that one of the mapping or when you said that one of the mapping or when you said that one of the CRA requirements is covered by one of CRA requirements is covered by one of CRA requirements is covered by one of the baseline requirements uh how much of the baseline requirements uh how much of the baseline requirements uh how much of the the CRA requirements are actually the the CRA requirements are actually the the CRA requirements are actually covered or is it 90% of the requirements covered or is it 90% of the requirements covered or is it 90% of the requirements are okay if I follow this practice from are okay if I follow this practice from are okay if I follow this practice from the baseline or 5% or and if not is the baseline or 5% or and if not is the baseline or 5% or and if not is there any plan on providing that so I there any plan on providing that so I there any plan on providing that so I also came out of finance and insurance also came out of finance and insurance also came out of finance and insurance so I have worked in heavily regulated so I have worked in heavily regulated so I have worked in heavily regulated industry countries. So my early years of industry countries. So my early years of industry countries. So my early years of experience, my opinion is uh a experience, my opinion is uh a experience, my opinion is uh a manufacturer could confidently state manufacturer could confidently state manufacturer could confidently state their case if they have the untampered their case if they have the untampered their case if they have the untampered evidence for 19 out of the 21 annex one evidence for 19 out of the 21 annex one evidence for 19 out of the 21 annex one requirements. And again, it's just the requirements. And again, it's just the requirements. And again, it's just the around personal identifiable around personal identifiable around personal identifiable information, which upstream normally information, which upstream normally information, which upstream normally doesn't. We don't touch that because doesn't. We don't touch that because doesn't. We don't touch that because we're not running a product. and then we're not running a product. and then we're not running a product. and then the ability to remove an EU citizen's the ability to remove an EU citizen's the ability to remove an EU citizen's information from your system. Again, we information from your system. Again, we information from your system. Again, we don't um projects have that mechanism, don't um projects have that mechanism, don't um projects have that mechanism, but that's not we don't sell a product. but that's not we don't sell a product. but that's not we don't sell a product. So, that's not something we typically So, that's not something we typically So, that's not something we typically do. So there isn't like a tool you run do. So there isn't like a tool you run do. So there isn't like a tool you run but so aside from those two I feel that but so aside from those two I feel that but so aside from those two I feel that you will if you follow the baseline you will if you follow the baseline you will if you follow the baseline requirements you have um you your requirements you have um you your requirements you have um you your components are following safe practices components are following safe practices components are following safe practices and where possible we're grabbing um the and where possible we're grabbing um the and where possible we're grabbing um the digitally authenticated attestation digitally authenticated attestation digitally authenticated attestation information that this is the security information that this is the security information that this is the security policy this is the link showing the policy this is the link showing the policy this is the link showing the GitHub configuration or GitLab GitHub configuration or GitLab GitHub configuration or GitLab configuration that sets this requirement configuration that sets this requirement configuration that sets this requirement in your CI system. So again, I think you in your CI system. So again, I think you in your CI system. So again, I think you have a very strong case. I'm not a have a very strong case. I'm not a have a very strong case. I'm not a lawyer. I'm not your lawyer. I don't lawyer. I'm not your lawyer. I don't lawyer. I'm not your lawyer. I don't work at your companies. It's up to you work at your companies. It's up to you work at your companies. It's up to you to make that. But you're looking at to make that. But you're looking at to make that. But you're looking at almost 95% is what you're you're almost 95% is what you're you're almost 95% is what you're you're theorizing. Yep. And again, I I've dealt theorizing. Yep. And again, I I've dealt theorizing. Yep. And again, I I've dealt with working with organizations like the with working with organizations like the with working with organizations like the OC and the Fed and other heavily serious OC and the Fed and other heavily serious OC and the Fed and other heavily serious auditors. And so I not my first rodeo. auditors. And so I not my first rodeo. auditors. And so I not my first rodeo. And I feel again uh as a audited person And I feel again uh as a audited person And I feel again uh as a audited person this if I had this type of evidence I this if I had this type of evidence I this if I had this type of evidence I think it would be a good relationship think it would be a good relationship think it would be a good relationship talking to for the CRA the market talking to for the CRA the market talking to for the CRA the market surveillance authority or when you're surveillance authority or when you're surveillance authority or when you're going through your uh CE mark process or going through your uh CE mark process or going through your uh CE mark process or if you know ENISA or somebody comes if you know ENISA or somebody comes if you know ENISA or somebody comes knocking on the door asking to see a knocking on the door asking to see a knocking on the door asking to see a copy of your sbomb. copy of your sbomb. copy of your sbomb. Yeah. And and it's probably also again Yeah. And and it's probably also again Yeah. And and it's probably also again worth like highlighting that worth like highlighting that worth like highlighting that um the baseline's great and in fact um the baseline's great and in fact um the baseline's great and in fact there's a lot of other projects in open there's a lot of other projects in open there's a lot of other projects in open source that are trying to also help out source that are trying to also help out source that are trying to also help out with the actual tooling piece. So again with the actual tooling piece. So again with the actual tooling piece. So again um it's not just about doing the um it's not just about doing the um it's not just about doing the practices, it's about proving that practices, it's about proving that practices, it's about proving that you're doing the practices. And so uh you're doing the practices. And so uh you're doing the practices. And so uh there's projects for example like those there's projects for example like those there's projects for example like those underneath the um cloud native computing underneath the um cloud native computing underneath the um cloud native computing foundation. There's one called In Toto foundation. There's one called In Toto foundation. There's one called In Toto which um looks at sort of essentially uh which um looks at sort of essentially uh which um looks at sort of essentially uh um defining the rules in a cryptographic um defining the rules in a cryptographic um defining the rules in a cryptographic way uh cryptographically attestable way way uh cryptographically attestable way way uh cryptographically attestable way and so you can have things like in Toto and so you can have things like in Toto and so you can have things like in Toto add astrations that you know you are add astrations that you know you are add astrations that you know you are essentially signing records of hey I essentially signing records of hey I essentially signing records of hey I checked let's just say as an example I checked let's just say as an example I checked let's just say as an example I ran OSV scanner right and I'm going to ran OSV scanner right and I'm going to ran OSV scanner right and I'm going to attest that I ran OSV scanner and that attest that I ran OSV scanner and that attest that I ran OSV scanner and that zero vulnerability showed up every day zero vulnerability showed up every day zero vulnerability showed up every day Right? And all of that can then be used Right? And all of that can then be used Right? And all of that can then be used as evidence in, you know, when, let's as evidence in, you know, when, let's as evidence in, you know, when, let's say, there are potentially findings. say, there are potentially findings. say, there are potentially findings. Hey, here's what we did. Hey, here's what we did. Hey, here's what we did. And if you're really bored or you're a And if you're really bored or you're a And if you're really bored or you're a masochist, you could have uh essentially masochist, you could have uh essentially masochist, you could have uh essentially a meeting every hour of every day of the a meeting every hour of every day of the a meeting every hour of every day of the week uh talking about this. This is an week uh talking about this. This is an week uh talking about this. This is an example of um the OpenSSF and the Linux example of um the OpenSSF and the Linux example of um the OpenSSF and the Linux Foundation's uh efforts in particular, Foundation's uh efforts in particular, Foundation's uh efforts in particular, but um Eclipse is holding similar but um Eclipse is holding similar but um Eclipse is holding similar meetings. Apache um upstream stewards meetings. Apache um upstream stewards meetings. Apache um upstream stewards are taking this very seriously. And then are taking this very seriously. And then are taking this very seriously. And then there are things like the Etsy and there are things like the Etsy and there are things like the Etsy and Senselac standardization meetings. So if Senselac standardization meetings. So if Senselac standardization meetings. So if you're bored and you like meetings, you you're bored and you like meetings, you you're bored and you like meetings, you can have some awesome meetings like 24 can have some awesome meetings like 24 can have some awesome meetings like 24 hours a day. It's great. But if you're hours a day. It's great. But if you're hours a day. It's great. But if you're interested to learn more, this is around interested to learn more, this is around interested to learn more, this is around our broad global cyber policy efforts our broad global cyber policy efforts our broad global cyber policy efforts which includes the US and India and which includes the US and India and which includes the US and India and China. Um, and then we also the security China. Um, and then we also the security China. Um, and then we also the security baseline. If you're interested in baseline. If you're interested in baseline. If you're interested in contributing or helping or learning contributing or helping or learning contributing or helping or learning more, we have uh similar information more, we have uh similar information more, we have uh similar information that I didn't put on the slide, but I that I didn't put on the slide, but I that I didn't put on the slide, but I can get you information on how to can get you information on how to can get you information on how to contact us and how to participate and contact us and how to participate and contact us and how to participate and kind of learn more about these artifacts kind of learn more about these artifacts kind of learn more about these artifacts and how you can help try to work with and how you can help try to work with and how you can help try to work with upstream maintainers to help them be a upstream maintainers to help them be a upstream maintainers to help them be a little more secure and then help the job little more secure and then help the job little more secure and then help the job of manufacturers comply and make that of manufacturers comply and make that of manufacturers comply and make that just a little bit easier for them. So, just a little bit easier for them. So, just a little bit easier for them. So, as a uh little bit of a closing note as a uh little bit of a closing note as a uh little bit of a closing note from me, from me, from me, um there was a point when the CRA was um there was a point when the CRA was um there was a point when the CRA was really, really scary. Yes. really, really scary. Yes. really, really scary. Yes. Um my employer runs a uh the Maven Um my employer runs a uh the Maven Um my employer runs a uh the Maven Central Registry and we were told at one Central Registry and we were told at one Central Registry and we were told at one point that we'd be legally accountable point that we'd be legally accountable point that we'd be legally accountable if anybody published a package with if anybody published a package with if anybody published a package with vulnerable code. It's like, okay, well vulnerable code. It's like, okay, well vulnerable code. It's like, okay, well then we're going to have to just turn then we're going to have to just turn then we're going to have to just turn off Europe, right? like like like we off Europe, right? like like like we off Europe, right? like like like we because people are going to publish because people are going to publish because people are going to publish packages with with vulnerabilities, packages with with vulnerabilities, packages with with vulnerabilities, right? There's there's no way that right? There's there's no way that right? There's there's no way that that's ever going to not happen, right? that's ever going to not happen, right? that's ever going to not happen, right? Uh there was a point where the CRA was Uh there was a point where the CRA was Uh there was a point where the CRA was really scary. Some maintainers that we really scary. Some maintainers that we really scary. Some maintainers that we know Yep. shut down their projects know Yep. shut down their projects know Yep. shut down their projects because they didn't want to be fined $10 because they didn't want to be fined $10 because they didn't want to be fined $10 million euros. Read the room, man. euros. Read the room, man. euros. Read the room, man. Sorry. Uh so there was a point where the Sorry. Uh so there was a point where the Sorry. Uh so there was a point where the CRA was very very scary but that point CRA was very very scary but that point CRA was very very scary but that point is in the past. The CRA has been refined is in the past. The CRA has been refined is in the past. The CRA has been refined is continuing to be refined. Uh in fact is continuing to be refined. Uh in fact is continuing to be refined. Uh in fact we had to make our slides last week as we had to make our slides last week as we had to make our slides last week as vague as possible because there were vague as possible because there were vague as possible because there were still meetings happening as we spoke still meetings happening as we spoke still meetings happening as we spoke like as we were presenting there is a like as we were presenting there is a like as we were presenting there is a meeting happening to refine some of the meeting happening to refine some of the meeting happening to refine some of the legislation. But the the fact is that legislation. But the the fact is that legislation. But the the fact is that right now for the first time in maybe right now for the first time in maybe right now for the first time in maybe history, first time that I can think of, history, first time that I can think of, history, first time that I can think of, we're at a point where we have legal we're at a point where we have legal we're at a point where we have legal systems, legislative systems coming and systems, legislative systems coming and systems, legislative systems coming and forcing us to unite and work together to forcing us to unite and work together to forcing us to unite and work together to produce cyber security outcomes. And produce cyber security outcomes. And produce cyber security outcomes. And this is where that compliance and this is where that compliance and this is where that compliance and security bridge is actually happening. security bridge is actually happening. security bridge is actually happening. And what we can do is we can be pulling And what we can do is we can be pulling And what we can do is we can be pulling in our open source dependencies, forking in our open source dependencies, forking in our open source dependencies, forking them and assuming that legal risk, that them and assuming that legal risk, that them and assuming that legal risk, that liability ourselves or we can be liability ourselves or we can be liability ourselves or we can be purchasing from a supplier who is uh purchasing from a supplier who is uh purchasing from a supplier who is uh assuming the legal liability themselves. assuming the legal liability themselves. assuming the legal liability themselves. Uh or we can be going out and supporting Uh or we can be going out and supporting Uh or we can be going out and supporting the actual upstream maintainers. We do the actual upstream maintainers. We do the actual upstream maintainers. We do have three options depending on your use have three options depending on your use have three options depending on your use case. One of them may be ideal. Four. case. One of them may be ideal. Four. case. One of them may be ideal. Four. Four. Oh, the fourth option sell in Four. Oh, the fourth option sell in Four. Oh, the fourth option sell in Europe. Yeah. Don't sell in Europe. Europe. Yeah. Don't sell in Europe. Europe. Yeah. Don't sell in Europe. Yeah, I guess. I mean, fifth option, Yeah, I guess. I mean, fifth option, Yeah, I guess. I mean, fifth option, it's only a giant market, you know? it's only a giant market, you know? it's only a giant market, you know? Fifth option is just take the fine, Fifth option is just take the fine, Fifth option is just take the fine, right? It's only 1%. Um, so there's right? It's only 1%. Um, so there's right? It's only 1%. Um, so there's there's options, right? But at the end there's options, right? But at the end there's options, right? But at the end of the day, if we're working together, of the day, if we're working together, of the day, if we're working together, if we are pursuing these outcomes if we are pursuing these outcomes if we are pursuing these outcomes together, the only thing that this is together, the only thing that this is together, the only thing that this is bad for is the bad guys. We are nearing bad for is the bad guys. We are nearing bad for is the bad guys. We are nearing a point in history where the people who a point in history where the people who a point in history where the people who have been going and jiggling doorork have been going and jiggling doorork have been going and jiggling doorork knobs are going to find every single knobs are going to find every single knobs are going to find every single door is locked. We are getting to that door is locked. We are getting to that door is locked. We are getting to that point and it is going to be possible if point and it is going to be possible if point and it is going to be possible if we continue to work together. If you go we continue to work together. If you go we continue to work together. If you go to probe and say how do I contribute to to probe and say how do I contribute to to probe and say how do I contribute to the open source security foundation's the open source security foundation's the open source security foundation's goals, right? If you go to u Mike and goals, right? If you go to u Mike and goals, right? If you go to u Mike and myself and say how do I get involved myself and say how do I get involved myself and say how do I get involved with finance or the cloudnative with finance or the cloudnative with finance or the cloudnative computing foundation and help improve computing foundation and help improve computing foundation and help improve the security state there? If you go to the security state there? If you go to the security state there? If you go to male and say, "Hey, what's going on with male and say, "Hey, what's going on with male and say, "Hey, what's going on with with the Eclipse Foundation and how can with the Eclipse Foundation and how can with the Eclipse Foundation and how can I contribute to security outcomes I contribute to security outcomes I contribute to security outcomes there?" If you go to Puerto and say there?" If you go to Puerto and say there?"

Uh yes and that's some of regulations. Uh yes and that's some of regulations. Uh yes and that's some of the work that we and others in the the work that we and others in the the work that we and others in the community are doing today. That's part community are doing today.

We feel there's an open source aware. We feel there's an open source aware. We feel there's an open source open source alternative that helps us open source alternative that helps us open source alternative that helps us people meet this standard. Um so yeah people meet this standard. Um so yeah people meet this standard. Um so yeah but patch is welcome if you have ideas but patch is welcome if you have ideas but patch is welcome if you have ideas you know contribute you we have a lot of you know contribute you we have a lot of you know contribute you we have a lot of different people that are directly different people that are directly different people that are directly working with the commission and u in working with the commission and u in working with the commission and u in Nissa and whatnot so reach out to us Nissa and whatnot so reach out to us Nissa and whatnot so reach out to us we're glad to help get your ideas put we're glad to help get your ideas put we're glad to help get your ideas put forth thanks forth thanks forth thanks welcome um also since I think we're welcome um also since I think we're welcome um also since I think we're almost at time I oh we have one more almost at time I oh we have one more almost at time I oh we have one more question we have one more question question we have one more question question we have one more question so you've talked a lot about you know so you've talked a lot about you know so you've talked a lot about you know Kubernetes Eclipse Foundation Kubernetes Eclipse Foundation Kubernetes Eclipse Foundation working with finance. Can you talk a working with finance. Can you talk a working with finance. Can you talk a little bit more about how uh the people little bit more about how uh the people little bit more about how uh the people in this room might activate their in this room might activate their in this room might activate their company to participate in a foundation? company to participate in a foundation? company to participate in a foundation? Like what does that look like? How do Like what does that look like? How do Like what does that look like? How do you get involved? I know I've spent a you get involved? I know I've spent a you get involved? I know I've spent a lot of time getting my company involved lot of time getting my company involved lot of time getting my company involved in in OpenSSF has been very valuable. in in OpenSSF has been very valuable. in in OpenSSF has been very valuable. And just some some thoughts on how And just some some thoughts on how And just some some thoughts on how someone might get started. someone might get started. someone might get started. From my perspective, From my perspective, From my perspective, the simplest, most coste effective and the simplest, most coste effective and the simplest, most coste effective and most effective way to get engaged in most effective way to get engaged in most effective way to get engaged in this process is working with uh the this process is working with uh the this process is working with uh the upstream from an open source upstream from an open source upstream from an open source perspective, working with those upstream perspective, working with those upstream perspective, working with those upstream open source stewards because uh many of open source stewards because uh many of open source stewards because uh many of us have a seat at the table and when us have a seat at the table and when us have a seat at the table and when we're able to come to um the regulators we're able to come to um the regulators we're able to come to um the regulators or in Nissa and say we have uh 16 global or in Nissa and say we have uh 16 global or in Nissa and say we have uh 16 global uh entities that feel this is uh you uh entities that feel this is uh you uh entities that feel this is uh you know have this opinion. We're able to know have this opinion. We're able to know have this opinion. We're able to kind of uh coalesce and bring together kind of uh coalesce and bring together kind of uh coalesce and bring together all these opinions and use a kind of a all these opinions and use a kind of a all these opinions and use a kind of a one voice methodology and that's very one voice methodology and that's very one voice methodology and that's very powerful. You know that the regulators powerful. You know that the regulators powerful. You know that the regulators recognize that that they care and they recognize that that they care and they recognize that that they care and they don't care about the the burdens for don't care about the the burdens for don't care about the the burdens for manufacturers. But you know where if we manufacturers. But you know where if we manufacturers. But you know where if we can highlight that you know this this can highlight that you know this this can highlight that you know this this idea this standard or framework is idea this standard or framework is idea this standard or framework is adopted across every auto manufacturer adopted across every auto manufacturer adopted across every auto manufacturer on the planet um that that's very on the planet um that that's very on the planet um that that's very compelling to them and it kind of helps compelling to them and it kind of helps compelling to them and it kind of helps uh highlight the eminence. So if you are uh highlight the eminence. So if you are uh highlight the eminence. So if you are interested in trying to help have this interested in trying to help have this interested in trying to help have this impact or think about how your company impact or think about how your company impact or think about how your company needs to react to this, find groups needs to react to this, find groups needs to react to this, find groups whether it's Linux Foundation, Eclipse, whether it's Linux Foundation, Eclipse, whether it's Linux Foundation, Eclipse, Apache, others. We're all working on Apache, others. We're all working on Apache, others. We're all working on this together. We cross talk quite a this together. We cross talk quite a this together. We cross talk quite a lot. So you know find a friend upstream lot. So you know find a friend upstream lot. So you know find a friend upstream and the baseline while you know my and the baseline while you know my and the baseline while you know my primary stakeholder was upstream primary stakeholder was upstream primary stakeholder was upstream maintainers it's also a great blueprint maintainers it's also a great blueprint maintainers it's also a great blueprint for your procurement or your software for your procurement or your software for your procurement or your software ingestion process. These are the types ingestion process. These are the types ingestion process. These are the types of things you should be looking at of of things you should be looking at of of things you should be looking at of your suppliers. What are they doing? And your suppliers. What are they doing? And your suppliers. What are they doing? And you potentially could turn that around you potentially could turn that around you potentially could turn that around and integrate that as part of your and integrate that as part of your and integrate that as part of your software and thirdarty component software and thirdarty component software and thirdarty component management program to say what are you management program to say what are you management program to say what are you doing around these things? How are you doing around these things? How are you doing around these things? How are you how do you control who gets the merge how do you control who gets the merge how do you control who gets the merge bit on the part on the software to bit on the part on the software to bit on the part on the software to guarantee that things aren't tampered guarantee that things aren't tampered guarantee that things aren't tampered with? So, there's a lot of ways to with? So, there's a lot of ways to with? So, there's a lot of ways to collaborate. collaborate. collaborate. Yeah. Um yeah, the uh one final thing Yeah.

I'll be talking a little bit in an hour at 11:00 a.m. about like bit in an hour at 11:00 a.m. about like bit in an hour at 11:00 a.m. about like some practical open source tools you can some practical open source tools you can some practical open source tools you can actually be using to implement stuff actually be using to implement stuff actually be using to implement stuff like baseline and some of the things like baseline and some of the things like baseline and some of the things that we've been talking about here. And that we've been talking about here. And that we've been talking about here. And and fun fact, I arranged that today is and fun fact, I arranged that today is and fun fact, I arranged that today is open source security day at open source security day at open source security day at Voncon. Every track touches on open Voncon. Every track touches on open Voncon. Every track touches on open source security today in every room. So source security today in every room. So source security today in every room. So Vincent Dan is speaking right after you Vincent Dan is speaking right after you Vincent Dan is speaking right after you and that is huge.
