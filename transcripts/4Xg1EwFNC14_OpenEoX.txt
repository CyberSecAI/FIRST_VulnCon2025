Uh I'm principal security Rogue. Uh I'm principal security Rogue. Uh I'm principal security engineer at Red Hat. And today I would engineer at Red Hat. And today I would engineer at Red Hat. And today I would like to show a short presentation about like to show a short presentation about like to show a short presentation about open UX project. Uh which is related to open UX project. Uh which is related to open UX project. Uh which is related to the product life cycle data the product life cycle data the product life cycle data representation in machine readable representation in machine readable representation in machine readable format. Uh I need to operate in two format. Uh I need to operate in two format. Uh I need to operate in two computers. There we go. So uh before we computers. There we go. So uh before we computers. There we go. So uh before we start discussing uh the open uh UX start discussing uh the open uh UX start discussing uh the open uh UX project conception and uh objectives, we project conception and uh objectives, we project conception and uh objectives, we need to better understand the product need to better understand the product need to better understand the product life cycle problems we have. We will life cycle problems we have. We will life cycle problems we have. We will start with uh simple product definition start with uh simple product definition start with uh simple product definition itself. Then we will talk about product itself. Then we will talk about product itself. Then we will talk about product uh identification very briefly and uh identification very briefly and uh identification very briefly and product versioning and why it's so product versioning and why it's so product versioning and why it's so important uh for us that will give us important uh for us that will give us important uh for us that will give us necessary uh foundation to to discuss necessary uh foundation to to discuss necessary uh foundation to to discuss the life cycle itself. the life cycle itself. the life cycle itself. uh knowing this uh we will have a better uh knowing this uh we will have a better uh knowing this uh we will have a better understanding of the life cycle data understanding of the life cycle data understanding of the life cycle data problems we struggle uh with today and problems we struggle uh with today and problems we struggle uh with today and uh then I will show how open open UX can uh then I will show how open open UX can uh then I will show how open open UX can address them at the end uh we will talk address them at the end uh we will talk address them at the end uh we will talk about example implementation and I will about example implementation and I will about example implementation and I will also quickly go through uh today's also quickly go through uh today's also quickly go through uh today's challenges uh in this project so let's challenges uh in this project so let's challenges uh in this project so let's start First, let's try to answer a start First, let's try to answer a start First, let's try to answer a simple question. What does product term simple question. What does product term simple question. What does product term stand for? And I know that it may sounds stand for? And I know that it may sounds stand for? And I know that it may sounds like a trivial question, but uh it's not like a trivial question, but uh it's not like a trivial question, but uh it's not the case. Uh I asked this question the case. Uh I asked this question the case. Uh I asked this question internally at Red Hat and um I receive a internally at Red Hat and um I receive a internally at Red Hat and um I receive a different answers from uh different uh different answers from uh different uh different answers from uh different uh organization, different teams. I was organization, different teams. I was organization, different teams. I was told that product is a single license. told that product is a single license. told that product is a single license. Yeah. uh other team told me that product Yeah. uh other team told me that product Yeah. uh other team told me that product is an offering which is associated with is an offering which is associated with is an offering which is associated with dedicated support model. Another team dedicated support model. Another team dedicated support model. Another team told me that product is a single uh told me that product is a single uh told me that product is a single uh upstream repository that is used uh at upstream repository that is used uh at upstream repository that is used uh at Red Hat product. Another team told me Red Hat product. Another team told me Red Hat product. Another team told me that product is a complex product with that product is a complex product with that product is a complex product with many components, packages, dependencies many components, packages, dependencies many components, packages, dependencies and this is the product because we build and this is the product because we build and this is the product because we build it at at the end. I heard also that it at at the end. I heard also that it at at the end. I heard also that product is a uh marketing name is a product is a uh marketing name is a product is a uh marketing name is a market product name which is a market product name which is a market product name which is a combination of many products together combination of many products together combination of many products together shift shipped as a one thing to the shift shipped as a one thing to the shift shipped as a one thing to the customer. So as you see uh the answer customer. So as you see uh the answer customer. So as you see uh the answer depends on the person who is asked and depends on the person who is asked and depends on the person who is asked and is it a problem? Well it's okay as long is it a problem? Well it's okay as long is it a problem? Well it's okay as long as we can uh precisely identify what we as we can uh precisely identify what we as we can uh precisely identify what we are talking about. Um today in this are talking about. Um today in this are talking about. Um today in this presentation I will focus on uh software products let's move to the next slide. products let's move to the next slide. products let's move to the next slide. So in regards to the software products So in regards to the software products So in regards to the software products um product identification in the um product identification in the um product identification in the industry uh we have many uh approaches industry uh we have many uh approaches industry uh we have many uh approaches how product can be identified. We can how product can be identified. We can how product can be identified. We can use CPEs everyone knows it very well. We use CPEs everyone knows it very well. We use CPEs everyone knows it very well. We can use PS package or usually used for can use PS package or usually used for can use PS package or usually used for uh g repositories but we can also use uh g repositories but we can also use uh g repositories but we can also use software identification tags software software identification tags software software identification tags software heritage ids and there are many more heritage ids and there are many more heritage ids and there are many more options. Uh today I don't want to spend options. Uh today I don't want to spend options. Uh today I don't want to spend too much time too much time too much time um uh on the software in dedication um uh on the software in dedication um uh on the software in dedication because uh tomorrow my good friend because uh tomorrow my good friend because uh tomorrow my good friend Martin uh has a dedicated session about Martin uh has a dedicated session about Martin uh has a dedicated session about this topic. Um today I would like to uh this topic. Um today I would like to uh this topic. Um today I would like to uh focus more on uh product versioning and focus more on uh product versioning and focus more on uh product versioning and why it's so important for us. So in the software management you will So in the software management you will So in the software management you will very fast understand that you need very fast understand that you need very fast understand that you need precise versioning uh that will allow precise versioning uh that will allow precise versioning uh that will allow you to distinguish changes in your uh you to distinguish changes in your uh you to distinguish changes in your uh software code. software code. software code. version locks the locks the the the the version locks the locks the the the the version locks the locks the the the the state of the software in the particular state of the software in the particular state of the software in the particular point of time uh that includes also all point of time uh that includes also all point of time uh that includes also all correlated requirements and dependencies correlated requirements and dependencies correlated requirements and dependencies for this software. So this is one for this software. So this is one for this software. So this is one version and if you want to include some version and if you want to include some version and if you want to include some update then you need to release a new update then you need to release a new update then you need to release a new version of that software that will again version of that software that will again version of that software that will again log the uh code of your application in a log the uh code of your application in a log the uh code of your application in a particular point of time on the the time particular point of time on the the time particular point of time on the the time of the release and again all correlated of the release and again all correlated of the release and again all correlated dependencies. At Red Hat uh we follow XY dependencies. At Red Hat uh we follow XY dependencies. At Red Hat uh we follow XY Z uh semantic Z uh semantic Z uh semantic versioning where X uh refers to the versioning where X uh refers to the versioning where X uh refers to the major versions of the product and uh major versions of the product and uh major versions of the product and uh each major version uh changes in all of each major version uh changes in all of each major version uh changes in all of those in each major versions are not those in each major versions are not those in each major versions are not backward uh compatible and many times backward uh compatible and many times backward uh compatible and many times update from one major version to another update from one major version to another update from one major version to another one uh is not that uh simple. one uh is not that uh simple. one uh is not that uh simple. Y refers to the minor versions also call Y refers to the minor versions also call Y refers to the minor versions also call it uh product streams. Uh updates that it uh product streams. Uh updates that it uh product streams. Uh updates that goes uh to the Y streams are backward goes uh to the Y streams are backward goes uh to the Y streams are backward compatible. And um at Red Hat use case compatible. And um at Red Hat use case compatible. And um at Red Hat use case uh many times uh one product has many uh many times uh one product has many uh many times uh one product has many multiple uh Y streams supported at the multiple uh Y streams supported at the multiple uh Y streams supported at the same time. same time. same time. Z refers to the asynchronous updates Z refers to the asynchronous updates Z refers to the asynchronous updates patches that are released as a part of patches that are released as a part of patches that are released as a part of the specific one uh Y stream. Uh let's the specific one uh Y stream. Uh let's the specific one uh Y stream. Uh let's take a look at the real example. Red Hat take a look at the real example. Red Hat take a look at the real example. Red Hat Open Shift container platform Open Shift container platform Open Shift container platform 4.18.5. Uh in this uh case four uh 4.18.5. Uh in this uh case four uh 4.18.5. Uh in this uh case four uh represents the major version of the Open represents the major version of the Open represents the major version of the Open Shift container platform product. 18 is Shift container platform product. 18 is Shift container platform product. 18 is a supported stream and five is the fifth a supported stream and five is the fifth a supported stream and five is the fifth update as a part of 4.18 stream update as a part of 4.18 stream update as a part of 4.18 stream uh stream itself as a supported um uh stream itself as a supported um uh stream itself as a supported um product version is uh associated with product version is uh associated with product version is uh associated with unique CP ids on this slide you you see unique CP ids on this slide you you see unique CP ids on this slide you you see uh official uh two CPS assigned to open uh official uh two CPS assigned to open uh official uh two CPS assigned to open sheet 4.18 sheet 4.18 sheet 4.18 stream so we just briefly discuss uh stream so we just briefly discuss uh stream so we just briefly discuss uh what product uh term can mean and how um what product uh term can mean and how um what product uh term can mean and how um we should use product versioning that we should use product versioning that we should use product versioning that give us necessary uh foundation to give us necessary uh foundation to give us necessary uh foundation to discuss the product life cycle. On this slide uh intentionally I cycle. On this slide uh intentionally I cycle. On this slide uh intentionally I included a full life cycle definition included a full life cycle definition included a full life cycle definition that is used in the open UX project. Um that is used in the open UX project. Um that is used in the open UX project. Um in short life cycle is a combination of in short life cycle is a combination of in short life cycle is a combination of product versioning and associated with product versioning and associated with product versioning and associated with this version uh product support model this version uh product support model this version uh product support model where support model is uh defined by where support model is uh defined by where support model is uh defined by vendor or owner of that product set of vendor or owner of that product set of vendor or owner of that product set of maintenance rules um starting from the maintenance rules um starting from the maintenance rules um starting from the release date release uh of the product release date release uh of the product release date release uh of the product GA date until the uh end of life and the GA date until the uh end of life and the GA date until the uh end of life and the maintenance scope can change over the maintenance scope can change over the maintenance scope can change over the time starting again from J to the end of time starting again from J to the end of time starting again from J to the end of life for the particular product or life for the particular product or life for the particular product or single uh product uh stream product single uh product uh stream product single uh product uh stream product version like we just discussed in the version like we just discussed in the version like we just discussed in the previous slide. We can distinguish many different slide. We can distinguish many different slide. We can distinguish many different support scopes uh which define the life support scopes uh which define the life support scopes uh which define the life cycle phases for that particular product cycle phases for that particular product cycle phases for that particular product or or product version and associated or or product version and associated or or product version and associated point of time in the product life. Um in point of time in the product life. Um in point of time in the product life. Um in this slide this slide this slide um I included u example sample of um I included u example sample of um I included u example sample of possible uh life cycle phases. So we can possible uh life cycle phases. So we can possible uh life cycle phases. So we can have for example maintenance support have for example maintenance support have for example maintenance support phase uh which is identified by end of phase uh which is identified by end of phase uh which is identified by end of maintenance uh support um type. Uh but maintenance uh support um type. Uh but maintenance uh support um type. Uh but we can also have end of vulnerability we can also have end of vulnerability we can also have end of vulnerability support end of migration support and support end of migration support and support end of migration support and many many more defined by the vendor or many many more defined by the vendor or many many more defined by the vendor or owner of the particular uh product or owner of the particular uh product or owner of the particular uh product or component. And those life cycle phases can be And those life cycle phases can be And those life cycle phases can be handled in a different handled in a different handled in a different way. We can distinguish two approaches. way. We can distinguish two approaches. way. We can distinguish two approaches. One is situation where the phases life One is situation where the phases life One is situation where the phases life cycle phases uh are connected together cycle phases uh are connected together cycle phases uh are connected together in a uh like a chain uh which is which in a uh like a chain uh which is which in a uh like a chain uh which is which is called it consecutive phases where is called it consecutive phases where is called it consecutive phases where end of one phase is a beginning of end of one phase is a beginning of end of one phase is a beginning of another life cycle phase like it is another life cycle phase like it is another life cycle phase like it is visible on this very very simple uh visible on this very very simple uh visible on this very very simple uh diagram. Another option diagram. Another option diagram. Another option is overlapping phases. Um where as you is overlapping phases. Um where as you is overlapping phases. Um where as you can see maintenance support phase one can see maintenance support phase one can see maintenance support phase one and maintenance support phase 2 the and maintenance support phase 2 the and maintenance support phase 2 the start date is exactly the same but the start date is exactly the same but the start date is exactly the same but the end dates of those two support phases end dates of those two support phases end dates of those two support phases are are are different. So to different. So to different. So to summarize product term can mean many summarize product term can mean many summarize product term can mean many things. Product versioning is very things. Product versioning is very things. Product versioning is very important and is associated with the important and is associated with the important and is associated with the product life cycle where in the product product life cycle where in the product product life cycle where in the product life cycle there can be many phases with life cycle there can be many phases with life cycle there can be many phases with different scopes and different end different scopes and different end different scopes and different end dates. It can be very complex in many dates. It can be very complex in many dates. It can be very complex in many cases isn't it? And the biggest problem cases isn't it? And the biggest problem cases isn't it? And the biggest problem is is is that today life cycle data uh are that today life cycle data uh are that today life cycle data uh are available mostly in a human readable available mostly in a human readable available mostly in a human readable formats. It is also important to mention right It is also important to mention right It is also important to mention right now that uh we can have a situation now that uh we can have a situation now that uh we can have a situation where we have two vendors that um offer where we have two vendors that um offer where we have two vendors that um offer two products. Those products could be two products. Those products could be two products. Those products could be very similar could even use exactly the very similar could even use exactly the very similar could even use exactly the same sources have the same functionality same sources have the same functionality same sources have the same functionality but there are two different life cycles but there are two different life cycles but there are two different life cycles depending of the vendor decision. There depending of the vendor decision. There depending of the vendor decision. There could be situation where one product is could be situation where one product is could be situation where one product is supported for a longer time but we supported for a longer time but we supported for a longer time but we limited very limited uh support scope limited very limited uh support scope limited very limited uh support scope when another product by distributed by when another product by distributed by when another product by distributed by another vendor uh has very short support another vendor uh has very short support another vendor uh has very short support uh life cycle but with very big uh life cycle but with very big uh life cycle but with very big scope. In this case we have also a scope. In this case we have also a scope. In this case we have also a situation where uh owner of a single situation where uh owner of a single situation where uh owner of a single component where from that owner component where from that owner component where from that owner perspective that single component like a perspective that single component like a perspective that single component like a giz repository is a product is already giz repository is a product is already giz repository is a product is already end of life is not supported by this by end of life is not supported by this by end of life is not supported by this by the maintainer but it's still supported the maintainer but it's still supported the maintainer but it's still supported by the other vendor who just use this by the other vendor who just use this by the other vendor who just use this component as a part of of his product. component as a part of of his product. component as a part of of his product. Right? And here we have open UX project where And here we have open UX project where And here we have open UX project where the main intention is to allow the main intention is to allow the main intention is to allow exchanging the life cycle data in the exchanging the life cycle data in the exchanging the life cycle data in the standardized machine readable format. Uh standardized machine readable format. Uh standardized machine readable format. Uh first intention when we start working on first intention when we start working on first intention when we start working on the open UX project was to cover only the open UX project was to cover only the open UX project was to cover only end of life and end of support end of life and end of support end of life and end of support uh maintenance phases. uh but uh very uh maintenance phases. uh but uh very uh maintenance phases. uh but uh very fast we realize that there are many more fast we realize that there are many more fast we realize that there are many more uh use cases which uh require data about uh use cases which uh require data about uh use cases which uh require data about different uh life cycle phases. We want different uh life cycle phases. We want different uh life cycle phases. We want to make sure that open UX will work uh to make sure that open UX will work uh to make sure that open UX will work uh together will be compatible with other together will be compatible with other together will be compatible with other um security data like sbombs or cysvex um security data like sbombs or cysvex um security data like sbombs or cysvex uh data uh that which will allow uh data uh that which will allow uh data uh that which will allow customers, users uh members of teams customers, users uh members of teams customers, users uh members of teams like security uh support, compliance like security uh support, compliance like security uh support, compliance teams, uh product planning, management teams, uh product planning, management teams, uh product planning, management including also sales and marketing including also sales and marketing including also sales and marketing teams. that will allow uh those all teams. that will allow uh those all teams. that will allow uh those all users easy accessible u way to get users easy accessible u way to get users easy accessible u way to get product life cycle information that product life cycle information that product life cycle information that product license data gathering is fast product license data gathering is fast product license data gathering is fast and can be done in an automated way. Here is a slide um where I wanted way. Here is a slide um where I wanted way. Here is a slide um where I wanted to present how open UX can work together to present how open UX can work together to present how open UX can work together with sbombs and uh cesaf data. In this with sbombs and uh cesaf data. In this with sbombs and uh cesaf data. In this case, user who for example take an ESBON case, user who for example take an ESBON case, user who for example take an ESBON for one particular product see the for one particular product see the for one particular product see the content of that product can verify and content of that product can verify and content of that product can verify and check the security statement based on check the security statement based on check the security statement based on the produced by the same vendor VX and the produced by the same vendor VX and the produced by the same vendor VX and CF data and at the same time can very CF data and at the same time can very CF data and at the same time can very easily check the product life cycle easily check the product life cycle easily check the product life cycle based on OPUX uh data produced by based on OPUX uh data produced by based on OPUX uh data produced by exactly the same vendor by uh by using exactly the same vendor by uh by using exactly the same vendor by uh by using the connection in this case the the connection in this case the the connection in this case the connection is through CPS and uh pools. connection is through CPS and uh pools. connection is through CPS and uh pools. So user can check that okay this is my So user can check that okay this is my So user can check that okay this is my product this is the content and this is product this is the content and this is product this is the content and this is the existing current phase uh for this the existing current phase uh for this the existing current phase uh for this product I know uh how long this phase uh product I know uh how long this phase uh product I know uh how long this phase uh will remain and how long this product will remain and how long this product will remain and how long this product will be will be will be supported let's take a look at real supported let's take a look at real supported let's take a look at real example so here is a red open shift example so here is a red open shift example so here is a red open shift container platform life cycle this is a container platform life cycle this is a container platform life cycle this is a screenshot from our public web page you screenshot from our public web page you screenshot from our public web page you can check it can check it can check it um as you can see Right now we support um as you can see Right now we support um as you can see Right now we support six different streams at the same time. six different streams at the same time. six different streams at the same time. Every stream is in a right now in a Every stream is in a right now in a Every stream is in a right now in a different uh support uh level different different uh support uh level different different uh support uh level different uh phase with different end dates. So uh phase with different end dates. So uh phase with different end dates. So it's really complex for the end user to it's really complex for the end user to it's really complex for the end user to to collect information in a easy um to collect information in a easy um to collect information in a easy um automated way. Uh what is the current automated way. Uh what is the current automated way. Uh what is the current state for the particular one of those state for the particular one of those state for the particular one of those streams at this point of time. But in streams at this point of time. But in streams at this point of time. But in open UX, we can represent this life open UX, we can represent this life open UX, we can represent this life cycle in a very easy and precise cycle in a very easy and precise cycle in a very easy and precise way. This is an example. Um um I didn't way. This is an example. Um um I didn't way. This is an example. Um um I didn't use any specific format. It's just an use any specific format. It's just an use any specific format. It's just an example how the data could be structured example how the data could be structured example how the data could be structured and what are the most important pieces and what are the most important pieces and what are the most important pieces here. So we have a product identify uh here. So we have a product identify uh here. So we have a product identify uh associated with dedicated UID. We have associated with dedicated UID. We have associated with dedicated UID. We have product pipe which is information what product pipe which is information what product pipe which is information what exactly it is in this case is like the exactly it is in this case is like the exactly it is in this case is like the cloud product business unit uh something cloud product business unit uh something cloud product business unit uh something that is important uh for Red Hat is like that is important uh for Red Hat is like that is important uh for Red Hat is like a cloud computing information about the a cloud computing information about the a cloud computing information about the parent product in this case Red Hat parent product in this case Red Hat parent product in this case Red Hat Enterprise Linux every product must have Enterprise Linux every product must have Enterprise Linux every product must have a associated all phases that are used in a associated all phases that are used in a associated all phases that are used in in this particular product. Uh I will in this particular product. Uh I will in this particular product. Uh I will show it in the next slide. Now we have show it in the next slide. Now we have show it in the next slide. Now we have all versions that exist for this all versions that exist for this all versions that exist for this product. in every single version is product. in every single version is product. in every single version is identified by CPE ID like I was identified by CPE ID like I was identified by CPE ID like I was presenting in the um previous slides and presenting in the um previous slides and presenting in the um previous slides and we can quickly check what is the we can quickly check what is the we can quickly check what is the previous what was the previous version previous what was the previous version previous what was the previous version what is the next version what is exist what is the next version what is exist what is the next version what is exist uh current phase right now at this uh current phase right now at this uh current phase right now at this moment as you can see uh right now uh moment as you can see uh right now uh moment as you can see uh right now uh version 4.12 is in a phase number four version 4.12 is in a phase number four version 4.12 is in a phase number four which is uh um represented by end of which is uh um represented by end of which is uh um represented by end of extended support extended support extended support uh um open UX uh type and associated uh um open UX uh type and associated uh um open UX uh type and associated date it's uh January date it's uh January date it's uh January 2026 like I said every product has list 2026 like I said every product has list 2026 like I said every product has list of all uh all phases and those phases of all uh all phases and those phases of all uh all phases and those phases has precise information what is included has precise information what is included has precise information what is included in the particular phase what you know in the particular phase what you know in the particular phase what you know rules are associated with that with that rules are associated with that with that rules are associated with that with that phase um on this slide uh I only phase um on this slide uh I only phase um on this slide uh I only included two the phase two phases the included two the phase two phases the included two the phase two phases the phase number uh one which is the GA date phase number uh one which is the GA date phase number uh one which is the GA date uh for this product and then we have uh for this product and then we have uh for this product and then we have phase number two uh represented by the phase number two uh represented by the phase number two uh represented by the end of full support type which is the end of full support type which is the end of full support type which is the full support phase and we have precise full support phase and we have precise full support phase and we have precise scope and in this case um it's not scope and in this case um it's not scope and in this case um it's not exactly what is um in the official open exactly what is um in the official open exactly what is um in the official open um shift container platform uh support um shift container platform uh support um shift container platform uh support model but I included that in theory you model but I included that in theory you model but I included that in theory you can use a scope and define as a multiple can use a scope and define as a multiple can use a scope and define as a multiple uh selection um array where you uh selection um array where you uh selection um array where you new features, bug fixes. Intentionally I new features, bug fixes. Intentionally I new features, bug fixes. Intentionally I um brought here that security patches um brought here that security patches um brought here that security patches could be distinguished based on the CV could be distinguished based on the CV could be distinguished based on the CV severity uh level as well. So every severity uh level as well. So every severity uh level as well. So every vendor can specify that for example in vendor can specify that for example in vendor can specify that for example in this product uh in this version and this this product uh in this version and this this product uh in this version and this point of time I will only release point of time I will only release point of time I will only release critical security updates nothing else. critical security updates nothing else. critical security updates nothing else. So it will be very precisely identify So it will be very precisely identify So it will be very precisely identify what user customer can expect from this what user customer can expect from this what user customer can expect from this specific version at this point of time what we have today in regards to time what we have today in regards to time what we have today in regards to challenges in the open UX project itself challenges in the open UX project itself challenges in the open UX project itself and um what are the challenges at Red and um what are the challenges at Red and um what are the challenges at Red Hat site. So on the openex project Hat site. So on the openex project Hat site. So on the openex project itself we're working right now uh on the itself we're working right now uh on the itself we're working right now uh on the universal taxonomy that will meet all universal taxonomy that will meet all universal taxonomy that will meet all poss possible users uh project poss possible users uh project poss possible users uh project users requirements. Uh we have ongoing users requirements. Uh we have ongoing users requirements. Uh we have ongoing discussion if it would be better to have discussion if it would be better to have discussion if it would be better to have a single scope as a interpret a single scope as a interpret a single scope as a interpret identification of the phase or maybe uh identification of the phase or maybe uh identification of the phase or maybe uh it would be better to have it would be better to have it would be better to have um less uh phases more on the more um less uh phases more on the more um less uh phases more on the more granular level. um but the scope will granular level. um but the scope will granular level. um but the scope will identify what exactly is included in identify what exactly is included in identify what exactly is included in that um specific phase. Uh we also had a that um specific phase. Uh we also had a that um specific phase. Uh we also had a discussion about uh if we want to use discussion about uh if we want to use discussion about uh if we want to use date ranges or maybe one single date date ranges or maybe one single date date ranges or maybe one single date will be enough at Red Hat. Uh we are will be enough at Red Hat. Uh we are will be enough at Red Hat. Uh we are discussing right now discussing right now discussing right now um how to use um this uh data standard um how to use um this uh data standard um how to use um this uh data standard across all organizations. uh we also across all organizations. uh we also across all organizations. uh we also have ongoing discussion about the scope have ongoing discussion about the scope have ongoing discussion about the scope of customization because not all data of customization because not all data of customization because not all data that we need internally at Red Hat um that we need internally at Red Hat um that we need internally at Red Hat um should go uh outside should be public. should go uh outside should be public. should go uh outside should be public. So it's a you know discussion about the So it's a you know discussion about the So it's a you know discussion about the difference between internal and external difference between internal and external difference between internal and external u data u data u data and at the end I would like to just and at the end I would like to just and at the end I would like to just summarize why we need this type of summarize why we need this type of summarize why we need this type of information. information. information. Today almost everyone can create asbomb Today almost everyone can create asbomb Today almost everyone can create asbomb for a product right uh then we have a for a product right uh then we have a for a product right uh then we have a lot of uh options how we want to show lot of uh options how we want to show lot of uh options how we want to show security posture for the particular security posture for the particular security posture for the particular product. So we have sbombs, we have product. So we have sbombs, we have product. So we have sbombs, we have already cis vex files, open vex and so already cis vex files, open vex and so already cis vex files, open vex and so on. But the biggest problem is that on. But the biggest problem is that on. But the biggest problem is that still uh we don't know what we're still uh we don't know what we're still uh we don't know what we're talking about. I can create an sbomb for talking about. I can create an sbomb for talking about. I can create an sbomb for one container image, my friend can one container image, my friend can one container image, my friend can create another sbomb and yeah we can create another sbomb and yeah we can create another sbomb and yeah we can assign some CVS. We can publish vex assign some CVS. We can publish vex assign some CVS. We can publish vex files but we don't know what exactly it files but we don't know what exactly it files but we don't know what exactly it is. Is it a single single g repository is. Is it a single single g repository is. Is it a single single g repository or this is a product? If is a product or this is a product? If is a product or this is a product? If is a product what is included in that product? So what is included in that product? So what is included in that product? So from the end user perspective, what from the end user perspective, what from the end user perspective, what exactly is the single source of truth exactly is the single source of truth exactly is the single source of truth here? Is it my sbomb and someone else here? Is it my sbomb and someone else here? Is it my sbomb and someone else vex or maybe someone else can prepare vex or maybe someone else can prepare vex or maybe someone else can prepare sbomb for my product? Where's where is sbomb for my product? Where's where is sbomb for my product? Where's where is the true? If we use open UX and we the true? If we use open UX and we the true? If we use open UX and we publish next to the sbomb this is the publish next to the sbomb this is the publish next to the sbomb this is the product is this is the type this is the product is this is the type this is the product is this is the type this is the where's who is the vendor. This is the where's who is the vendor. This is the where's who is the vendor. This is the product life cycle and this is what is product life cycle and this is what is product life cycle and this is what is propos promised as a part of this life propos promised as a part of this life propos promised as a part of this life cycle that will clear that will be very cycle that will clear that will be very cycle that will clear that will be very clear and give us clear picture where we clear and give us clear picture where we clear and give us clear picture where we are and what we're talking about. So are and what we're talking about. So are and what we're talking about. So that's it from my side for today. Thank that's it from my side for today. Thank that's it from my side for today. Thank you very much. Uh and now we have a you very much. Uh and now we have a you very much. Uh and now we have a couple of minutes for questions. We have couple of minutes for questions. We have couple of minutes for questions. We have just a few minutes. Uh I'll start over just a few minutes. Uh I'll start over just a few minutes. Uh I'll start over here. Good morning. Uh this is John. So, when Good morning. Uh this is John. So, when Good morning. Uh this is John. So, when you speak of end of life, does that mean you speak of end of life, does that mean you speak of end of life, does that mean if it's a proprietary product, if I if it's a proprietary product, if I if it's a proprietary product, if I continue still to use it, am I now continue still to use it, am I now continue still to use it, am I now violating your license with me because violating your license with me because violating your license with me because you're no longer selling it? you're no longer selling it? you're no longer selling it? Well, I wouldn't say that it's a license Well, I wouldn't say that it's a license Well, I wouldn't say that it's a license v violation because uh I will just as a v violation because uh I will just as a v violation because uh I will just as a owner of this product, I promise you to owner of this product, I promise you to owner of this product, I promise you to deliver some type of support and this is deliver some type of support and this is deliver some type of support and this is the end of life. You know, at that time the end of life. You know, at that time the end of life. You know, at that time there's no more support from my side. If there's no more support from my side. If there's no more support from my side. If you want to continue using it, of you want to continue using it, of you want to continue using it, of course. Okay. I can't maintain it course. Okay. I can't maintain it course. Okay. I can't maintain it because it's your product. Well, we can because it's your product. Well, we can because it's your product. Well, we can use it. Okay. At my risk. Okay. Thank use it. Okay. At my risk. Okay. Thank use it. Okay. At my risk. Okay. Thank you. Yeah. Oh, Oh, Oh, we're going to just wait for the next we're going to just wait for the next we're going to just wait for the next one. one. one. It's my turn to talk, Marina. It's my turn to talk, Marina. It's my turn to talk, Marina. So, um, Rogue, thank you for sharing So, um, Rogue, thank you for sharing So, um, Rogue, thank you for sharing this today. Um, is one of the challenges this today. Um, is one of the challenges this today. Um, is one of the challenges or that might have been grammatically or that might have been grammatically or that might have been grammatically awful. I don't know. is one of the awful. I don't know. is one of the awful. I don't know. is one of the challenges you're seeing um where do we challenges you're seeing um where do we challenges you're seeing um where do we source this life cycle data from? Is it source this life cycle data from? Is it source this life cycle data from? Is it a human inputting this data? Um and it's a human inputting this data? Um and it's a human inputting this data? Um and it's if so, it's only as good as the the if so, it's only as good as the the if so, it's only as good as the the process and humans maintaining it. And process and humans maintaining it. And process and humans maintaining it. And then also how do you account for those then also how do you account for those then also how do you account for those situations where some products like to situations where some products like to situations where some products like to say support starts at you know the say support starts at you know the say support starts at you know the release plus three months or something release plus three months or something release plus three months or something like that. So just kind of curious if like that. So just kind of curious if like that. So just kind of curious if you've discussed those challenges. Yeah. you've discussed those challenges. Yeah. you've discussed those challenges. Yeah. So um this is really to the uh back end So um this is really to the uh back end So um this is really to the uh back end implementation what will how it will be implementation what will how it will be implementation what will how it will be stored on uh our side like you know on stored on uh our side like you know on stored on uh our side like you know on you know internally uh at Red Hat. Uh we you know internally uh at Red Hat. Uh we you know internally uh at Red Hat. Uh we can have a connection between two can have a connection between two can have a connection between two phases. Um let me show it in phases. Um let me show it in phases. Um let me show it in slide. slide. slide. Uh there we go. So we can have we can Uh there we go. So we can have we can Uh there we go. So we can have we can have a connection between phases and we have a connection between phases and we have a connection between phases and we can specify that for example the next can specify that for example the next can specify that for example the next phase end of date is phase number like phase end of date is phase number like phase end of date is phase number like for example phase number four the end for example phase number four the end for example phase number four the end date is phase number two number three date is phase number two number three date is phase number two number three plus x days that will that will you know plus x days that will that will you know plus x days that will that will you know represent that we have today in the represent that we have today in the represent that we have today in the human enable format. human enable format. human enable format. Oh, okay. It's not the case in in Oh, okay. It's not the case in in Oh, okay. It's not the case in in regards to the open shift container regards to the open shift container regards to the open shift container platform, but we have already products platform, but we have already products platform, but we have already products at Red Hat where the life cycle is at Red Hat where the life cycle is at Red Hat where the life cycle is specify uh date plus x uh months or for specify uh date plus x uh months or for specify uh date plus x uh months or for example next release, next next version example next release, next next version example next release, next next version plus x months or days. But the same can plus x months or days. But the same can plus x months or days. But the same can be represented in the open ex standard be represented in the open ex standard be represented in the open ex standard by joining specific by joining specific by joining specific phases and adding that the end of phases and adding that the end of phases and adding that the end of previous phase plus x days or month is a previous phase plus x days or month is a previous phase plus x days or month is a date end of the next phase. Yeah, you still you need someone who who Yeah, you still you need someone who who Yeah, you still you need someone who who owns the life cycle for that for the owns the life cycle for that for the owns the life cycle for that for the product to decide when there there is product to decide when there there is product to decide when there there is going to be next release, next version going to be next release, next version going to be next release, next version or for example when and how long that or for example when and how long that or for example when and how long that product is going to be product is going to be product is going to be supported. We can add a lot of supported. We can add a lot of supported. We can add a lot of validations that make sure that there validations that make sure that there validations that make sure that there are no for example are no for example are no for example uh mixing information that you know the uh mixing information that you know the uh mixing information that you know the next phase and is before the previous next phase and is before the previous next phase and is before the previous one. So they still they need there must one. So they still they need there must one. So they still they need there must be validation of the data but at the be validation of the data but at the be validation of the data but at the then at the end it will be a owner of then at the end it will be a owner of then at the end it will be a owner of the product who will specify what is the the product who will specify what is the the product who will specify what is the life cycle. life cycle. life cycle. Marina I have very basic question Marina I have very basic question Marina I have very basic question because I miss the beginning. So open because I miss the beginning. So open because I miss the beginning. So open EUX is a new standard that you're EUX is a new standard that you're EUX is a new standard that you're working on. Yes. What does EOX stands working on. Yes. What does EOX stands working on. Yes. What does EOX stands for? Uh at the beginning we wanted only for? Uh at the beginning we wanted only for? Uh at the beginning we wanted only to cover end of life and um end of to cover end of life and um end of to cover end of life and um end of um support but that's why we created um support but that's why we created um support but that's why we created that open UX term. So I think I'm just going to follow on So I think I'm just going to follow on So I think I'm just going to follow on with what you just sort of saying said with what you just sort of saying said with what you just sort of saying said is that in the beginning we had a is that in the beginning we had a is that in the beginning we had a certain thing that we were working certain thing that we were working certain thing that we were working towards. I from what I'm hearing we're towards. I from what I'm hearing we're towards. I from what I'm hearing we're complexing it and making it a little complexing it and making it a little complexing it and making it a little bigger than what we need maybe from the bigger than what we need maybe from the bigger than what we need maybe from the start. Have we thought of phasing our start. Have we thought of phasing our start. Have we thought of phasing our approach here so that we could just have approach here so that we could just have approach here so that we could just have some of the basics? I I understand some of the basics? I I understand some of the basics? I I understand trying to figure out how to tie it in trying to figure out how to tie it in trying to figure out how to tie it in the ESBO and VEX and all that, but I the ESBO and VEX and all that, but I the ESBO and VEX and all that, but I feel like we just we need to get the feel like we just we need to get the feel like we just we need to get the industry to agree to at least the industry to agree to at least the industry to agree to at least the original stuff. So, what what are we original stuff. So, what what are we original stuff. So, what what are we doing to at least get somewhere? That's doing to at least get somewhere? That's doing to at least get somewhere? That's a very good question. Yes. Um we cannot a very good question. Yes. Um we cannot a very good question. Yes. Um we cannot address all problems in one shot, you address all problems in one shot, you address all problems in one shot, you know, in one in one release. So know, in one in one release. So know, in one in one release. So definitely we need uh implementation definitely we need uh implementation definitely we need uh implementation phases and um right now there's ongoing phases and um right now there's ongoing phases and um right now there's ongoing discussion what is the minimum for this discussion what is the minimum for this discussion what is the minimum for this project to just start it make sure that project to just start it make sure that project to just start it make sure that people will use it and then a adjusted people will use it and then a adjusted people will use it and then a adjusted over the time based on the customer over the time based on the customer over the time based on the customer needs. So right now we want to make sure needs. So right now we want to make sure needs. So right now we want to make sure that we can support the most the the that we can support the most the the that we can support the most the the most typical use cases with this G8 end most typical use cases with this G8 end most typical use cases with this G8 end of life end of of life end of of life end of specific phase and that's it. Yes. I was curious your thoughts Yes. I was curious your thoughts Yes. I was curious your thoughts on both uncooperative vendors or just on both uncooperative vendors or just on both uncooperative vendors or just um maybe maybe being more generous, um maybe maybe being more generous, um maybe maybe being more generous, ignorant vendors and helping them along ignorant vendors and helping them along ignorant vendors and helping them along because obviously this sort of thing because obviously this sort of thing because obviously this sort of thing that needs that needs that needs uh there's a big hurdle in the beginning uh there's a big hurdle in the beginning uh there's a big hurdle in the beginning in order to be useful and if you're in order to be useful and if you're in order to be useful and if you're relying on vendors to do it, it's going relying on vendors to do it, it's going relying on vendors to do it, it's going to be very difficult to get enough to be very difficult to get enough to be very difficult to get enough momentum to make it tremendously useful. momentum to make it tremendously useful. momentum to make it tremendously useful. But if if you had some sort of texonomy But if if you had some sort of texonomy But if if you had some sort of texonomy in there for community supported or this in there for community supported or this in there for community supported or this is being maintained by this person who is being maintained by this person who is being maintained by this person who doesn't actually work for the company doesn't actually work for the company doesn't actually work for the company but likes to read their website or but likes to read their website or but likes to read their website or something like that might be helpful. something like that might be helpful. something like that might be helpful. Yeah, that's very true that at the Yeah, that's very true that at the Yeah, that's very true that at the beginning the implementation will take a beginning the implementation will take a beginning the implementation will take a long time and will be very problematic. long time and will be very problematic. long time and will be very problematic. But like I said today we have really big But like I said today we have really big But like I said today we have really big data problem. You know, everyone talks data problem. You know, everyone talks data problem. You know, everyone talks about sbombs, but even if if you compare about sbombs, but even if if you compare about sbombs, but even if if you compare two sbombs, it's really difficult to say two sbombs, it's really difficult to say two sbombs, it's really difficult to say what exactly it is. I see that list of what exactly it is. I see that list of what exactly it is. I see that list of the content nice, but what exactly it is and sbombs have really gained is and sbombs have really gained is and sbombs have really gained momentum from both government pushing on momentum from both government pushing on momentum from both government pushing on it and um for better words, insurance it and um for better words, insurance it and um for better words, insurance companies pushing, you know, customers companies pushing, you know, customers companies pushing, you know, customers pushing on it. So, yeah, if you can get pushing on it. So, yeah, if you can get pushing on it. So, yeah, if you can get that same sort of momentum, it'd be an that same sort of momentum, it'd be an that same sort of momentum, it'd be an excellent way to work. Yeah, I agree. excellent way to work. Yeah, I agree. excellent way to work. Yeah, I agree. And I I really believe that Open UX can And I I really believe that Open UX can And I I really believe that Open UX can help you know clean a little bit the help you know clean a little bit the help you know clean a little bit the current problems. Any guesses or any way to know what the Any guesses or any way to know what the Any guesses or any way to know what the level of adoption is? Number of packages level of adoption is?

I'm not sure I'm not sure I'm not sure EX how many projects have it how many EX how many projects have it how many EX how many projects have it how many projects okay well again it's right now projects okay well again it's right now projects okay well again it's right now it's too early right now at Red Hat we it's too early right now at Red Hat we it's too early right now at Red Hat we we are as even at Red Hat we're in a we are as even at Red Hat we're in a we are as even at Red Hat we're in a very stage uh where we just discussing very stage uh where we just discussing very stage uh where we just discussing how to do it and how to publish to how to do it and how to publish to how to do it and how to publish to customers so it's right now it's too customers so it's right now it's too customers so it's right now it's too early we can we cannot you know even we early we can we cannot you know even we early we can we cannot you know even we don't don't don't know who exactly can use it today Hello. Hi, this is Mayorish. Uh, one Hello. Hi, this is Mayorish. Uh, one Hello. Hi, this is Mayorish. Uh, one question. We just implemented CESAF that question. We just implemented CESAF that question. We just implemented CESAF that was uh introduced by Red Hat uh was uh introduced by Red Hat uh was uh introduced by Red Hat uh recently. Um, so why are we working on recently. Um, so why are we working on recently. Um, so why are we working on two different uh standards when we can two different uh standards when we can two different uh standards when we can leverage the same standard uh because leverage the same standard uh because leverage the same standard uh because CESF is again security related uh this CESF is again security related uh this CESF is again security related uh this is EOL again you can talk about it in is EOL again you can talk about it in is EOL again you can talk about it in security terms. So why not just uh make security terms. So why not just uh make security terms. So why not just uh make two two two different well uh very good question and different well uh very good question and different well uh very good question and the problem is that the scope is the problem is that the scope is the problem is that the scope is different like I was presenting in one different like I was presenting in one different like I was presenting in one of the slides product life cycle could of the slides product life cycle could of the slides product life cycle could be very complex and you need to know be very complex and you need to know be very complex and you need to know what is available today for this what is available today for this what is available today for this particular product version and it's particular product version and it's particular product version and it's impossible to put it all of those things impossible to put it all of those things impossible to put it all of those things to one standard and create a giant and to one standard and create a giant and to one standard and create a giant and metadata information. It's it's metadata information. It's it's metadata information. It's it's impossible and changes in the CIS files impossible and changes in the CIS files impossible and changes in the CIS files are more u dynamic when the life cycle are more u dynamic when the life cycle are more u dynamic when the life cycle is more is more is more stable. Okay. Uh I know there's a couple stable. Okay. Uh I know there's a couple stable. Okay. Uh I know there's a couple other questions in the room. I encourage other questions in the room. I encourage other questions in the room. I encourage you to put the questions into Discord. you to put the questions into Discord. you to put the questions into Discord. At this point we are out of time. Let's At this point we are out of time. Let's At this point we are out of time. Let's give a big round of applause to Rogue.
