Kind: captions Language: en Um, again, the the title of today's Um, again, the the title of today's Um, again, the the title of today's presentation is CPE metadata know it presentation is CPE metadata know it presentation is CPE metadata know it all. um in the fast-paced environment all. um in the fast-paced environment all. um in the fast-paced environment that we operate in, whether it be that that we operate in, whether it be that that we operate in, whether it be that you're managing security you're managing security you're managing security vulnerabilities, improving compliance, vulnerabilities, improving compliance, vulnerabilities, improving compliance, or enhancing your IT systems, I think or enhancing your IT systems, I think or enhancing your IT systems, I think knowing a little bit more about CP knowing a little bit more about CP knowing a little bit more about CP metadata could help you build a more metadata could help you build a more metadata could help you build a more robust vulnerability management robust vulnerability management robust vulnerability management process. So, a little bit about me process. So, a little bit about me process. So, a little bit about me before we get started. I'm an infosc before we get started. I'm an infosc before we get started. I'm an infosc engineer at MongoDB. Um, I've got engineer at MongoDB. Um, I've got engineer at MongoDB. Um, I've got previous experience in risk assessment previous experience in risk assessment previous experience in risk assessment and management as a consultant in one of and management as a consultant in one of and management as a consultant in one of the big four firms, but now my focus is the big four firms, but now my focus is the big four firms, but now my focus is primarily product security where I lead primarily product security where I lead primarily product security where I lead the MongoDB bug bounty program and the the MongoDB bug bounty program and the the MongoDB bug bounty program and the CVE disclosure process. Um, I've come CVE disclosure process. Um, I've come CVE disclosure process. Um, I've come from London. uh and uh throughout this from London. uh and uh throughout this from London. uh and uh throughout this presentation we're going to explore what presentation we're going to explore what presentation we're going to explore what CP metadata is, its crucial roles and CP metadata is, its crucial roles and CP metadata is, its crucial roles and other discoveries as part of my research other discoveries as part of my research other discoveries as part of my research into the into the into the topic. Okay. So before diving deeper topic. Okay. So before diving deeper topic. Okay. So before diving deeper into the topic itself, I did make a into the topic itself, I did make a into the topic itself, I did make a little assumption that um the listeners little assumption that um the listeners little assumption that um the listeners of today's talk will have some of today's talk will have some of today's talk will have some background knowledge on the CVE world background knowledge on the CVE world background knowledge on the CVE world and all the acronyms that come with it. and all the acronyms that come with it. and all the acronyms that come with it. It is a lot of acronyms. Um but a little It is a lot of acronyms. Um but a little It is a lot of acronyms. Um but a little bit of like a overview of what these bit of like a overview of what these bit of like a overview of what these are. So CVE stands for common are. So CVE stands for common are. So CVE stands for common vulnerabilities and exposure. It's vulnerabilities and exposure. It's vulnerabilities and exposure. It's basically a list of publicly known basically a list of publicly known basically a list of publicly known security vulnerabilities and um yeah security vulnerabilities and um yeah security vulnerabilities and um yeah within the CVE it contains within the CVE it contains within the CVE it contains characteristics or metadata that we will characteristics or metadata that we will characteristics or metadata that we will be discussing today. So some of them are be discussing today. So some of them are be discussing today. So some of them are CBSS which stands for common CBSS which stands for common CBSS which stands for common vulnerability scoring system. uh CWE vulnerability scoring system. uh CWE vulnerability scoring system. uh CWE common weakness enumeration common weakness enumeration common weakness enumeration uh CPE which we will talk about today uh uh CPE which we will talk about today uh uh CPE which we will talk about today uh MVD national vulnerability database and MVD national vulnerability database and MVD national vulnerability database and lastly CNA which is the CVE numbering lastly CNA which is the CVE numbering lastly CNA which is the CVE numbering authority which basically allows authority which basically allows authority which basically allows organizations to issue CVS. organizations to issue CVS. organizations to issue CVS. Okay. Um okay what is CPE? Uh in more Okay. Um okay what is CPE? Uh in more Okay. Um okay what is CPE? Uh in more detail, CP stands for common platform detail, CP stands for common platform detail, CP stands for common platform enumeration and it is a scheme developed enumeration and it is a scheme developed enumeration and it is a scheme developed by NVD um also known as the national by NVD um also known as the national by NVD um also known as the national vulnerability database and they are a vulnerability database and they are a vulnerability database and they are a supporting body of the CPE CVE program. supporting body of the CPE CVE program. supporting body of the CPE CVE program. Um so they created this scheme to Um so they created this scheme to Um so they created this scheme to provide standard standardization and provide standard standardization and provide standard standardization and structure for um information technology structure for um information technology structure for um information technology systems, software and packages. And in systems, software and packages. And in systems, software and packages. And in even simpler terms, it's a standardized even simpler terms, it's a standardized even simpler terms, it's a standardized naming system uh for a software or naming system uh for a software or naming system uh for a software or hardware down to the specific version um hardware down to the specific version um hardware down to the specific version um or the configuration of that product. or the configuration of that product. or the configuration of that product. So why is it important to have a So why is it important to have a So why is it important to have a standardized naming system? And CPEs are standardized naming system? And CPEs are standardized naming system? And CPEs are a very easy way to enable organizations a very easy way to enable organizations a very easy way to enable organizations in security management. They allow in security management. They allow in security management. They allow security professionals and tools to security professionals and tools to security professionals and tools to identify and manage vulnerabilities in identify and manage vulnerabilities in identify and manage vulnerabilities in their systems down to the specific uh their systems down to the specific uh their systems down to the specific uh affected product and version. Um they affected product and version. Um they affected product and version. Um they also provide consistency in naming also provide consistency in naming also provide consistency in naming um within and between um within and between um within and between organizations. And then lastly, they organizations. And then lastly, they organizations. And then lastly, they also help with automation. So with these also help with automation. So with these also help with automation. So with these standardized identifiers, automated standardized identifiers, automated standardized identifiers, automated systems can process security alerts more efficiently. Okay. So, not only are CPEs efficiently. Okay. So, not only are CPEs efficiently. Okay. So, not only are CPEs created by MVD, they're also maintained created by MVD, they're also maintained created by MVD, they're also maintained by MVD through a invaluable resource by MVD through a invaluable resource by MVD through a invaluable resource called the CP dictionary. And this this called the CP dictionary. And this this called the CP dictionary. And this this dictionary compiles of all known CPEs, dictionary compiles of all known CPEs, dictionary compiles of all known CPEs, serving as a database where you can serving as a database where you can serving as a database where you can locate the CPEs of any product that has locate the CPEs of any product that has locate the CPEs of any product that has had a CVE issued. Um to make the most of had a CVE issued. Um to make the most of had a CVE issued. Um to make the most of this resource, organizations can access this resource, organizations can access this resource, organizations can access this dictionary via the NVD APIs or you this dictionary via the NVD APIs or you this dictionary via the NVD APIs or you can download it directly on their can download it directly on their can download it directly on their website. Um so all CVES when they get website. Um so all CVES when they get website. Um so all CVES when they get published at some point um they get published at some point um they get published at some point um they get analyzed by an MVD analyst and they analyzed by an MVD analyst and they analyzed by an MVD analyst and they those analysts they add metadata and those analysts they add metadata and those analysts they add metadata and including CPEs and once these CPEs are including CPEs and once these CPEs are including CPEs and once these CPEs are included they they get updated into the included they they get updated into the included they they get updated into the dictionary and the dictionary is updated daily. Okay. So I briefly touched on daily. Okay. So I briefly touched on daily. Okay. So I briefly touched on CVES throughout this and um why are they CVES throughout this and um why are they CVES throughout this and um why are they also very crucial. I wanted to break it also very crucial. I wanted to break it also very crucial. I wanted to break it down into a simple concept of who, what, down into a simple concept of who, what, down into a simple concept of who, what, where and how. So firstly addressing the where and how. So firstly addressing the where and how. So firstly addressing the who which is a security who which is a security who which is a security vulnerability. Um, every security vulnerability. Um, every security vulnerability. Um, every security vulnerability publicly known gets vulnerability publicly known gets vulnerability publicly known gets assigned a CVE and at its core CVE assigned a CVE and at its core CVE assigned a CVE and at its core CVE contains the title and description of contains the title and description of contains the title and description of the vulnerability, but it also holds the vulnerability, but it also holds the vulnerability, but it also holds essential characteristics of the essential characteristics of the essential characteristics of the vulnerability. Uh, in this case, we'll vulnerability. Uh, in this case, we'll vulnerability. Uh, in this case, we'll be calling them metadata. Uh, next next be calling them metadata. Uh, next next be calling them metadata. Uh, next next we have the what. This represents the we have the what. This represents the we have the what. This represents the CBSS score and it tells us the severity CBSS score and it tells us the severity CBSS score and it tells us the severity of the vulnerability providing a of the vulnerability providing a of the vulnerability providing a quantitative measure to allow you to quantitative measure to allow you to quantitative measure to allow you to assess its impact. Um and then we have assess its impact. Um and then we have assess its impact. Um and then we have the wear. This is the CBE indicating the the wear. This is the CBE indicating the the wear. This is the CBE indicating the affected product and version. So it affected product and version. So it affected product and version. So it helps you pinpoint exactly where the helps you pinpoint exactly where the helps you pinpoint exactly where the vulnerability exists in a vulnerability exists in a vulnerability exists in a system. And then finally how this is system. And then finally how this is system. And then finally how this is captured by the C.WE we common weakness captured by the C.WE we common weakness captured by the C.WE we common weakness enumeration and it describes a weakness enumeration and it describes a weakness enumeration and it describes a weakness that led to the that led to the that led to the vulnerability. So a lot of people vulnerability. So a lot of people vulnerability. So a lot of people actually depend on this data and actually depend on this data and actually depend on this data and historically MVD has been a key provider historically MVD has been a key provider historically MVD has been a key provider of uh enriched CDEs specifically the of uh enriched CDEs specifically the of uh enriched CDEs specifically the CBSS and the CBSS and the CBSS and the CPE. Um these characteristics and CPE. Um these characteristics and CPE. Um these characteristics and metadata are essential for CVE metadata are essential for CVE metadata are essential for CVE consumers. Our research has found that consumers. Our research has found that consumers. Our research has found that um vendors are quite reliant on this um vendors are quite reliant on this um vendors are quite reliant on this metadata provided by NVD uh where metadata provided by NVD uh where metadata provided by NVD uh where vulnerability scanners use these vulnerability scanners use these vulnerability scanners use these metadata in their tools in identifying metadata in their tools in identifying metadata in their tools in identifying and managing vulnerabilities. Okay, so what's the vulnerabilities. Okay, so what's the vulnerabilities. Okay, so what's the problem? Every good story has a problem? Every good story has a problem? Every good story has a challenge. So in early 2024, NVD challenge. So in early 2024, NVD challenge. So in early 2024, NVD announced that they will be slowing down announced that they will be slowing down announced that they will be slowing down its process in enriching CVEes with its process in enriching CVEes with its process in enriching CVEes with crucial metadata like CVSS and CPEs. Now crucial metadata like CVSS and CPEs. Now crucial metadata like CVSS and CPEs. Now this discussion this announcement led to this discussion this announcement led to this discussion this announcement led to discussion within the industry about how discussion within the industry about how discussion within the industry about how it impacts um the users and for it impacts um the users and for it impacts um the users and for particularly for us at MongoDB, we were particularly for us at MongoDB, we were particularly for us at MongoDB, we were curious how it would affect our curious how it would affect our curious how it would affect our customers um and the user experience of customers um and the user experience of customers um and the user experience of CVES. CVES. CVES. Um, essentially the slowdown meant that Um, essentially the slowdown meant that Um, essentially the slowdown meant that the addition of necessary metadata might the addition of necessary metadata might the addition of necessary metadata might not be happening as swiftly or as not be happening as swiftly or as not be happening as swiftly or as comprehensively as before, meaning that comprehensively as before, meaning that comprehensively as before, meaning that vulnerabilities might be vulnerabilities might be vulnerabilities might be miscatategorized or even leaving systems miscatategorized or even leaving systems miscatategorized or even leaving systems still vulnerable. still vulnerable. still vulnerable. So as so CNAs uh they they can issue So as so CNAs uh they they can issue So as so CNAs uh they they can issue CVEEs using the JSON schema created by CVEEs using the JSON schema created by CVEEs using the JSON schema created by the CPE program. But here's something the CPE program. But here's something the CPE program. But here's something quite interesting. Uh CNAs are not quite interesting. Uh CNAs are not quite interesting. Uh CNAs are not required to apply metadata when issuing required to apply metadata when issuing required to apply metadata when issuing CVEes. So but support for CVSS and CWE CVEes. So but support for CVSS and CWE CVEes. So but support for CVSS and CWE metadata is quite well known. Um however metadata is quite well known. Um however metadata is quite well known. Um however CPE metadata doesn't get as much CPE metadata doesn't get as much CPE metadata doesn't get as much attention. uh even though the JSON attention. uh even though the JSON attention. uh even though the JSON schema itself schema itself schema itself accommodates the publishing of CPEs in accommodates the publishing of CPEs in accommodates the publishing of CPEs in them. Now looking at the table, them. Now looking at the table, them. Now looking at the table, historically over 50% of all CVEEs have historically over 50% of all CVEEs have historically over 50% of all CVEEs have included CVSS and C.WE. Um this is included CVSS and C.WE. Um this is included CVSS and C.WE. Um this is probably because the usage of them in probably because the usage of them in probably because the usage of them in daily operations is more common. uh but daily operations is more common. uh but daily operations is more common. uh but the kicker is that only 13% of 13.3% of the kicker is that only 13% of 13.3% of the kicker is that only 13% of 13.3% of all CBES issued contain CPEs. Now this all CBES issued contain CPEs. Now this all CBES issued contain CPEs. Now this gap highlights an area of improvement uh gap highlights an area of improvement uh gap highlights an area of improvement uh definitely when it comes to bone definitely when it comes to bone definitely when it comes to bone enrichment. And so then another question enrichment. And so then another question enrichment. And so then another question arises, if NVD doesn't do this, then who arises, if NVD doesn't do this, then who arises, if NVD doesn't do this, then who will? Okay, over the past few years, the will? Okay, over the past few years, the will? Okay, over the past few years, the number of CVEs issued per year has been number of CVEs issued per year has been number of CVEs issued per year has been growing at an accelerating rate. And growing at an accelerating rate. And growing at an accelerating rate. And historically, the issuance of CVEEs historically, the issuance of CVEEs historically, the issuance of CVEEs showed modest numbers of around or under showed modest numbers of around or under showed modest numbers of around or under 10,000 CBEs per year until 2017 where 10,000 CBEs per year until 2017 where 10,000 CBEs per year until 2017 where there was a pivotal doubling of the CBES there was a pivotal doubling of the CBES there was a pivotal doubling of the CBES issued compared to the previous issued compared to the previous issued compared to the previous year. year. year. Um so this could be because there is a Um so this could be because there is a Um so this could be because there is a rising awareness of CBEEs and the need rising awareness of CBEEs and the need rising awareness of CBEEs and the need for catalog cataloging vulnerabilities. for catalog cataloging vulnerabilities. for catalog cataloging vulnerabilities. And then since then there has been a set And then since then there has been a set And then since then there has been a set increase until 2024 where there was a increase until 2024 where there was a increase until 2024 where there was a 38% increase compared to the previous 38% increase compared to the previous 38% increase compared to the previous year. Now this isn't as much as double year. Now this isn't as much as double year. Now this isn't as much as double but um as the global but um as the global but um as the global community becomes more familiar with the community becomes more familiar with the community becomes more familiar with the central roles of CVEEs in security central roles of CVEEs in security central roles of CVEEs in security management this trend is likely to management this trend is likely to management this trend is likely to continue. And then crucially the number continue. And then crucially the number continue. And then crucially the number of CVE numbering authorities authorities of CVE numbering authorities authorities of CVE numbering authorities authorities aka CNAs underscores this trend. So you aka CNAs underscores this trend. So you aka CNAs underscores this trend. So you can see on the graph in blue showing the can see on the graph in blue showing the can see on the graph in blue showing the total number of CNAs at the end of every total number of CNAs at the end of every total number of CNAs at the end of every year almost mimics the trend of number year almost mimics the trend of number year almost mimics the trend of number of CBES issued that year. If we look at of CBES issued that year. If we look at of CBES issued that year. If we look at the most recent years, in the most recent years, in the most recent years, in 2022, 2022, 2022, 54 CNAs joined the group, followed by 84 54 CNAs joined the group, followed by 84 54 CNAs joined the group, followed by 84 in 2023 and 88 in in 2023 and 88 in in 2023 and 88 in 2024. At time of data collection in 2024. At time of data collection in 2024. At time of data collection in 2025, there are 447 2025, there are 447 2025, there are 447 CNAs. Um, but only a subset of VCNAs can CNAs. Um, but only a subset of VCNAs can CNAs. Um, but only a subset of VCNAs can issue CBEEs for entities outside of issue CBEEs for entities outside of issue CBEEs for entities outside of their immediia offering. Um, this their immediia offering. Um, this their immediia offering. Um, this suggests that there are potential suggests that there are potential suggests that there are potential vulnerabilities not yet documented as vulnerabilities not yet documented as vulnerabilities not yet documented as there are billions of products out there. And then we have to tie back to there. And then we have to tie back to there. And then we have to tie back to CDs because that's the title of the CDs because that's the title of the CDs because that's the title of the presentation. Um, as mentioned before, presentation. Um, as mentioned before, presentation. Um, as mentioned before, the CNAs use the JSON schema set up by the CNAs use the JSON schema set up by the CNAs use the JSON schema set up by the CVE program. um and uh they publish the CVE program. um and uh they publish the CVE program. um and uh they publish CVEEs via JSON files and they these CVEEs via JSON files and they these CVEEs via JSON files and they these files can be accessible on the CVE page files can be accessible on the CVE page files can be accessible on the CVE page but also on the CV program GitHub public but also on the CV program GitHub public but also on the CV program GitHub public repo. So I've been able to pull that repo. So I've been able to pull that repo. So I've been able to pull that data to uh read the JSON files and data to uh read the JSON files and data to uh read the JSON files and created this this graph which is very created this this graph which is very created this this graph which is very similar to the previous G graph but each similar to the previous G graph but each similar to the previous G graph but each bar is separated into two segments. So bar is separated into two segments. So bar is separated into two segments. So the teal segment covers the JSON files the teal segment covers the JSON files the teal segment covers the JSON files that have the number of JSON files that that have the number of JSON files that that have the number of JSON files that have CPEs in them and then the orange have CPEs in them and then the orange have CPEs in them and then the orange segment shows those files without CPEs. segment shows those files without CPEs. segment shows those files without CPEs. Now there is an assumption that this Now there is an assumption that this Now there is an assumption that this orange segment is enriched by MVD orange segment is enriched by MVD orange segment is enriched by MVD themselves suggesting the substantial themselves suggesting the substantial themselves suggesting the substantial effort by MVD in manually adding those effort by MVD in manually adding those effort by MVD in manually adding those CPEs for those CVEes. CPEs for those CVEes. CPEs for those CVEes. Now if we look at the teal segment over Now if we look at the teal segment over Now if we look at the teal segment over the years we also notice a slight the years we also notice a slight the years we also notice a slight increase um throughout the years but increase um throughout the years but increase um throughout the years but significantly there's a spike in 2023 significantly there's a spike in 2023 significantly there's a spike in 2023 and and and 2024. So historically the percentage of 2024. So historically the percentage of 2024. So historically the percentage of CPE inclusion remained around 10% or CPE inclusion remained around 10% or CPE inclusion remained around 10% or below below below um until 2023 and 2024 where it um until 2023 and 2024 where it um until 2023 and 2024 where it increased to 26% and 54% increased to 26% and 54% increased to 26% and 54% respectively. the percentage increase in respectively. the percentage increase in respectively. the percentage increase in 2024 over doubles compared to 2023 and 2024 over doubles compared to 2023 and 2024 over doubles compared to 2023 and this could be because of MVD's this could be because of MVD's this could be because of MVD's announcement um of slowing down its uh announcement um of slowing down its uh announcement um of slowing down its uh metadata enrichment. So as MVD continues metadata enrichment. So as MVD continues metadata enrichment. So as MVD continues to refine its processes, it's crucial to to refine its processes, it's crucial to to refine its processes, it's crucial to address the potential widening gap that address the potential widening gap that address the potential widening gap that could occur if the CVE issuance rates could occur if the CVE issuance rates could occur if the CVE issuance rates continue. So that orange segment could continue. So that orange segment could continue. So that orange segment could potentially increase throughout the potentially increase throughout the potentially increase throughout the years. And actually in a talk yesterday years. And actually in a talk yesterday years. And actually in a talk yesterday by Andrew by Andrew by Andrew um one of the very first talks in the um one of the very first talks in the um one of the very first talks in the morning yesterday he mentioned that the morning yesterday he mentioned that the morning yesterday he mentioned that the MVD and even CISA they're struggling MVD and even CISA they're struggling MVD and even CISA they're struggling with vone enrichment. So I suspect that with vone enrichment. So I suspect that with vone enrichment. So I suspect that orange segment will increase. Um here I wanted to share that there are Um here I wanted to share that there are Um here I wanted to share that there are actually quite a few CNAs already actually quite a few CNAs already actually quite a few CNAs already self-enriching and I've listed some the self-enriching and I've listed some the self-enriching and I've listed some the top five in terms of volume including top five in terms of volume including top five in terms of volume including CPEs in their JSON files. Now it's also CPEs in their JSON files. Now it's also CPEs in their JSON files. Now it's also important to mention that although CNAs important to mention that although CNAs important to mention that although CNAs might have a history of adding CPEs uh might have a history of adding CPEs uh might have a history of adding CPEs uh they might not be able to do so for all they might not be able to do so for all they might not be able to do so for all the CBEEs that they issue and this could the CBEEs that they issue and this could the CBEEs that they issue and this could be due to their roles. So I've mentioned be due to their roles. So I've mentioned be due to their roles. So I've mentioned before there are 447 CNAs in total and before there are 447 CNAs in total and before there are 447 CNAs in total and we found that 288 CNAs are issuing CVEEs we found that 288 CNAs are issuing CVEEs we found that 288 CNAs are issuing CVEEs with CPEs in them. Now this is 64% and with CPEs in them. Now this is 64% and with CPEs in them. Now this is 64% and initially this looks like a really initially this looks like a really initially this looks like a really strong number but when you compare it to strong number but when you compare it to strong number but when you compare it to the percentage in the percentage in the percentage in 2024 there were only 2024 there were only 2024 there were only 54% of CVEEs that included those CPEs. 54% of CVEEs that included those CPEs. 54% of CVEEs that included those CPEs. And then when you compare it to all CBES And then when you compare it to all CBES And then when you compare it to all CBES issued ever, it's issued ever, it's issued ever, it's 13.3%. Now, why is there that huge 13.3%. Now, why is there that huge 13.3%. Now, why is there that huge discrepancy? And this again could be due discrepancy? And this again could be due discrepancy? And this again could be due to the roles that the CNAs have. to the roles that the CNAs have. to the roles that the CNAs have. Um, some of these CNAs are issuing CVEEs Um, some of these CNAs are issuing CVEEs Um, some of these CNAs are issuing CVEEs for organizations that don't have the for organizations that don't have the for organizations that don't have the CNA status themselves. And we know that CNA status themselves. And we know that CNA status themselves. And we know that CPEs, adding CPEs can be quite labor CPEs, adding CPEs can be quite labor CPEs, adding CPEs can be quite labor intensive since it requires a bit of intensive since it requires a bit of intensive since it requires a bit of research and creating those CPEs for the research and creating those CPEs for the research and creating those CPEs for the specific product. Um, our research specific product. Um, our research specific product. Um, our research actually didn't dive deeper into the actually didn't dive deeper into the actually didn't dive deeper into the decision making behind why they would decision making behind why they would decision making behind why they would include CPEs for some and others. Uh but include CPEs for some and others. Uh but include CPEs for some and others. Uh but again this this inconsistent number again this this inconsistent number again this this inconsistent number could be due to the fact that that uh could be due to the fact that that uh could be due to the fact that that uh that addition requires a lot of manual that addition requires a lot of manual that addition requires a lot of manual work. Okay. To bridge this gap in CP work. Okay. To bridge this gap in CP work. Okay. To bridge this gap in CP inclusion, increasing awareness and inclusion, increasing awareness and inclusion, increasing awareness and understanding of CP metadata among CNAs understanding of CP metadata among CNAs understanding of CP metadata among CNAs and industry stakeholders can ensure and industry stakeholders can ensure and industry stakeholders can ensure more comprehensive data is available more comprehensive data is available more comprehensive data is available from the outset from the get-go rather from the outset from the get-go rather from the outset from the get-go rather than post-publication tweaks and than post-publication tweaks and than post-publication tweaks and enhancements. enhancements. enhancements. So besides spreading awareness, we So besides spreading awareness, we So besides spreading awareness, we encourage that all CNAs include CPEs in encourage that all CNAs include CPEs in encourage that all CNAs include CPEs in their CVEEs and making CPEs more their CVEEs and making CPEs more their CVEEs and making CPEs more noticeable and familiar within those noticeable and familiar within those noticeable and familiar within those JSON files will ensure vulnerability JSON files will ensure vulnerability JSON files will ensure vulnerability scanners pick them up um rather than scanners pick them up um rather than scanners pick them up um rather than depending on the metadata provided by depending on the metadata provided by depending on the metadata provided by the MVD the MVD the MVD APIs. So pushing this widespread CB APIs. So pushing this widespread CB APIs. So pushing this widespread CB integration alongside metadata uh integration alongside metadata uh integration alongside metadata uh alongside other metadata we're alongside other metadata we're alongside other metadata we're prioritizing security we're doing right prioritizing security we're doing right prioritizing security we're doing right by our customers and we're also by our customers and we're also by our customers and we're also enforcing the idea that enrichment is enforcing the idea that enrichment is enforcing the idea that enrichment is equals enablement for everyone involved. MongoDB has had a long history of MongoDB has had a long history of MongoDB has had a long history of self-enrichment in CVEEs and self-enrichment in CVEEs and self-enrichment in CVEEs and historically we have only been issuing historically we have only been issuing historically we have only been issuing our CVs with CVSS and C.WE again because our CVs with CVSS and C.WE again because our CVs with CVSS and C.WE again because they were more common. Um but in they were more common. Um but in they were more common. Um but in response to NVD's announcement we saw response to NVD's announcement we saw response to NVD's announcement we saw that there was an importance to include that there was an importance to include that there was an importance to include these CPEs for our to better serve our these CPEs for our to better serve our these CPEs for our to better serve our customers. So what does it actually look customers. So what does it actually look customers. So what does it actually look like? Um, as a CNA, we have the ability like? Um, as a CNA, we have the ability like? Um, as a CNA, we have the ability and responsibility to issue CDES using and responsibility to issue CDES using and responsibility to issue CDES using JSON files. Um, and the schema actually JSON files. Um, and the schema actually JSON files. Um, and the schema actually accommodates the all the metawid data accommodates the all the metawid data accommodates the all the metawid data we've discussed, including CPEs. And we've discussed, including CPEs. And we've discussed, including CPEs. And specifically, the schema the schema specifically, the schema the schema specifically, the schema the schema features a an affected section with an features a an affected section with an features a an affected section with an array called CPEs. And this is where you array called CPEs. And this is where you array called CPEs. And this is where you just copy and paste the CPEs into. Now just copy and paste the CPEs into. Now just copy and paste the CPEs into. Now right now our approach is fairly manual right now our approach is fairly manual right now our approach is fairly manual but we maintain our own CPE database and but we maintain our own CPE database and but we maintain our own CPE database and uh we update that based on our own uh we update that based on our own uh we update that based on our own product releases and it's just a simple product releases and it's just a simple product releases and it's just a simple Google sheet. Um so we can copy and Google sheet. Um so we can copy and Google sheet. Um so we can copy and paste the CPEs into the JSON files. paste the CPEs into the JSON files. paste the CPEs into the JSON files. Um so the initial setup is quite manual Um so the initial setup is quite manual Um so the initial setup is quite manual because you have to parse through the because you have to parse through the because you have to parse through the CPE dictionary find the CPEs already uh CPE dictionary find the CPEs already uh CPE dictionary find the CPEs already uh available for your product so that you available for your product so that you available for your product so that you maintain consistency but once you've maintain consistency but once you've maintain consistency but once you've done that initial setup like the done that initial setup like the done that initial setup like the maintenance is quite straightforward and maintenance is quite straightforward and maintenance is quite straightforward and quite quite quite easy. Okay, I've spoken a lot about CPS easy. Okay, I've spoken a lot about CPS easy. Okay, I've spoken a lot about CPS but this is what they look like. Um this but this is what they look like. Um this but this is what they look like. Um this is a basic structure of what a CPE would is a basic structure of what a CPE would is a basic structure of what a CPE would look like and essentially you fill in look like and essentially you fill in look like and essentially you fill in those gaps. Uh taking one of MongoDB those gaps. Uh taking one of MongoDB those gaps. Uh taking one of MongoDB CPEs as an example, the format starts CPEs as an example, the format starts CPEs as an example, the format starts off with CPE 2.3 which basically tells off with CPE 2.3 which basically tells off with CPE 2.3 which basically tells us that we are using the 2.3 version of us that we are using the 2.3 version of us that we are using the 2.3 version of the CPE the CPE the CPE specification. So the version is quite specification. So the version is quite specification. So the version is quite important so we can maintain consistency important so we can maintain consistency important so we can maintain consistency across um across systems. across um across systems. across um across systems. Following that you have the part Following that you have the part Following that you have the part component and in this example it component and in this example it component and in this example it identifies the type of entity which is identifies the type of entity which is identifies the type of entity which is application A and uh that um that application A and uh that um that application A and uh that um that separates it or distinguishes it from an separates it or distinguishes it from an separates it or distinguishes it from an operating system O or hardware operating system O or hardware operating system O or hardware H and then following that you have the H and then following that you have the H and then following that you have the vendor component where here we have vendor component where here we have vendor component where here we have MongoDB specifying that MongoDB is the MongoDB specifying that MongoDB is the MongoDB specifying that MongoDB is the vendor. Um and then after that we have vendor. Um and then after that we have vendor. Um and then after that we have product component which here is the rust product component which here is the rust product component which here is the rust driver. So in this instance we are driver. So in this instance we are driver. So in this instance we are pointing to the rust driver developed by pointing to the rust driver developed by pointing to the rust driver developed by MongoDB. And then you have the version MongoDB. And then you have the version MongoDB. And then you have the version component which here is component which here is component which here is 0.10.0 and this is this is crucial for 0.10.0 and this is this is crucial for 0.10.0 and this is this is crucial for patch management and vulnerability patch management and vulnerability patch management and vulnerability assessments. So so far in this CPE we've assessments. So so far in this CPE we've assessments. So so far in this CPE we've specified we're using the 2.3 version of specified we're using the 2.3 version of specified we're using the 2.3 version of the CPE specification. the CPE specification. the CPE specification. Um uh the product is the rush driver Um uh the product is the rush driver Um uh the product is the rush driver version version version 0.10.0 developed by 0.10.0 developed by 0.10.0 developed by MongoDB. Now the rest of those rest of MongoDB. Now the rest of those rest of MongoDB. Now the rest of those rest of the components are optional. So things the components are optional. So things the components are optional. So things like update, addition, language. Uh they like update, addition, language. Uh they like update, addition, language. Uh they allow flexibility and specificity if and allow flexibility and specificity if and allow flexibility and specificity if and when needed. But in our and in our when needed. But in our and in our when needed. But in our and in our example, it's uh it's represented by example, it's uh it's represented by example, it's uh it's represented by wild cards. wild cards. wild cards. um uh and they serve as placeholders for um uh and they serve as placeholders for um uh and they serve as placeholders for unspecified unspecified unspecified values. In this specific example, we values. In this specific example, we values. In this specific example, we have MongoDB which is the target have MongoDB which is the target have MongoDB which is the target software location. And this is a little software location. And this is a little software location. And this is a little bit weird because when we looked into bit weird because when we looked into bit weird because when we looked into CPEs created for MongoDB, we have a CPEs created for MongoDB, we have a CPEs created for MongoDB, we have a product called MongoDB server and for product called MongoDB server and for product called MongoDB server and for some reason the name of that product in some reason the name of that product in some reason the name of that product in the CPE specification like in the CPE the CPE specification like in the CPE the CPE specification like in the CPE dictionary was just MongoDB. So here we dictionary was just MongoDB. So here we dictionary was just MongoDB. So here we are saying that the rust driver are saying that the rust driver are saying that the rust driver developed by MongoDB is to be used on developed by MongoDB is to be used on developed by MongoDB is to be used on MongoDB server but for some reason the MongoDB server but for some reason the MongoDB server but for some reason the like the history is that MongoDB is like the history is that MongoDB is like the history is that MongoDB is MongoDB server as well. Um again MongoDB server as well. Um again MongoDB server as well. Um again highlighting the need for CNES to be highlighting the need for CNES to be highlighting the need for CNES to be creating their own CPEs just so that we creating their own CPEs just so that we creating their own CPEs just so that we can provide that extra level of detail. can provide that extra level of detail. can provide that extra level of detail. Um but yeah understanding the structure Um but yeah understanding the structure Um but yeah understanding the structure allows you to effectively use CPEs. allows you to effectively use CPEs. allows you to effectively use CPEs. um in security management and ensuring um in security management and ensuring um in security management and ensuring accurate identification of products for accurate identification of products for accurate identification of products for vulnerability assessments and communication. So as we've discussed, communication. So as we've discussed, communication. So as we've discussed, CNAs have the ability to enrich their CNAs have the ability to enrich their CNAs have the ability to enrich their own CVEes thanks to the permissions own CVEes thanks to the permissions own CVEes thanks to the permissions under the CVE program who sets out the under the CVE program who sets out the under the CVE program who sets out the standards and the rules. But it's also standards and the rules. But it's also standards and the rules. But it's also important to point out that MBD important to point out that MBD important to point out that MBD themselves are not a CNA or an themselves are not a CNA or an themselves are not a CNA or an authorized data publisher which is authorized data publisher which is authorized data publisher which is another status created by the CVE another status created by the CVE another status created by the CVE program to help with CVE program to help with CVE program to help with CVE enrichment. But MVD has played a huge enrichment. But MVD has played a huge enrichment. But MVD has played a huge role in the CV system and the broader role in the CV system and the broader role in the CV system and the broader vulnerability management field. Their vulnerability management field. Their vulnerability management field. Their APIs provided very key metadata that APIs provided very key metadata that APIs provided very key metadata that many vulnerability scanners use. And as many vulnerability scanners use. And as many vulnerability scanners use. And as the industry is changing fast, we need the industry is changing fast, we need the industry is changing fast, we need we think it's really important that CNES we think it's really important that CNES we think it's really important that CNES add their own details um to their add their own details um to their add their own details um to their CBEES. So when you're working on CPEs, CBEES. So when you're working on CPEs, CBEES. So when you're working on CPEs, first you have to make sure that there's first you have to make sure that there's first you have to make sure that there's not already a scheme present for your not already a scheme present for your not already a scheme present for your product. Uh this keeps everything product. Uh this keeps everything product. Uh this keeps everything consistent and and with existing product consistent and and with existing product consistent and and with existing product versions. But if you have a new product versions. But if you have a new product versions. But if you have a new product that isn't listed, you can create a CPE that isn't listed, you can create a CPE that isn't listed, you can create a CPE and add it to the CBE JSON file and add it to the CBE JSON file and add it to the CBE JSON file yourself. Uh that should update yourself. Uh that should update yourself. Uh that should update everything accordingly in including the everything accordingly in including the everything accordingly in including the CPE CPE CPE dictionary. Um the recent slowdown with dictionary. Um the recent slowdown with dictionary. Um the recent slowdown with NVD showed us again why it's important NVD showed us again why it's important NVD showed us again why it's important to manage this process ourselves. Since to manage this process ourselves. Since to manage this process ourselves. Since CPEs haven't always been well known, CPEs haven't always been well known, CPEs haven't always been well known, it's clear how valuable they are. it's clear how valuable they are. it's clear how valuable they are. I hope this message is quite going I hope this message is quite going I hope this message is quite going through like I'm drilling it quite a through like I'm drilling it quite a through like I'm drilling it quite a bit. Um, we should be self-enriching and bit. Um, we should be self-enriching and bit. Um, we should be self-enriching and encouraging our CNAs to include CPEs in encouraging our CNAs to include CPEs in encouraging our CNAs to include CPEs in our CVEes. By doing this, we provide a our CVEes. By doing this, we provide a our CVEes. By doing this, we provide a more complete CVE from the beginning and more complete CVE from the beginning and more complete CVE from the beginning and improve the way we handle improve the way we handle improve the way we handle vulnerabilities across the vulnerabilities across the vulnerabilities across the board. That's it for board. That's it for board. That's it for me. Thank you. me. Thank you. me. Thank you. Um, I believe we have question. I don't Um, I believe we have question. I don't Um, I believe we have question. I don't know if that mic works. There's no one in here, so I'm works. There's no one in here, so I'm works. There's no one in here, so I'm going to do it myself. So, my question is I or my myself. So, my question is I or my myself. So, my question is I or my statement is I agree with you. CNA statement is I agree with you. CNA statement is I agree with you. CNA should be self-enriching. should be self-enriching. should be self-enriching. Agreed. Um, but what is the benefit to Agreed. Um, but what is the benefit to Agreed. Um, but what is the benefit to the CNA to do this and more because the CNA to do this and more because the CNA to do this and more because again I'm sure there's a cost in again I'm sure there's a cost in again I'm sure there's a cost in manpower, time, etc. manpower, time, etc. manpower, time, etc. and what is the governance in place? and what is the governance in place? and what is the governance in place? Because if there's no real governance, Because if there's no real governance, Because if there's no real governance, no real rules or consequences to them no real rules or consequences to them no real rules or consequences to them not doing it, what's the enforcement not doing it, what's the enforcement not doing it, what's the enforcement action versus saying, "Please be nice to action versus saying, "Please be nice to action versus saying, "Please be nice to your customers. Please spend this money your customers. Please spend this money your customers. Please spend this money on something that's not directly on something that's not directly on something that's not directly benefiting the CNAs and their benefiting the CNAs and their benefiting the CNAs and their companies." companies." companies." So, what I understood was why should So, what I understood was why should So, what I understood was why should CNAs do this, right? Why should they CNAs do this, right? Why should they CNAs do this, right? Why should they self-enrich? What's the benefit of them self-enrich? What's the benefit of them self-enrich? What's the benefit of them doing that? doing that? doing that? And is there any rules behind? Yeah. And is there any rules behind? Yeah. And is there any rules behind? Yeah. Yeah. They they should do Yeah, they Yeah. They they should do Yeah, they Yeah. They they should do Yeah, they should do this. It's good for their should do this. It's good for their should do this. It's good for their customers, but for the CNAs themselves, customers, but for the CNAs themselves, customers, but for the CNAs themselves, what is the benefit to the CNAs? what is the benefit to the CNAs? what is the benefit to the CNAs? Um, so I mean I I'm I'm obviously only Um, so I mean I I'm I'm obviously only Um, so I mean I I'm I'm obviously only be able to speak on behalf of MongoDB be able to speak on behalf of MongoDB be able to speak on behalf of MongoDB who is a CNA and um we issue CVEEs who is a CNA and um we issue CVEEs who is a CNA and um we issue CVEEs uh or want to be CNAs because we get uh or want to be CNAs because we get uh or want to be CNAs because we get full control over what is being said full control over what is being said full control over what is being said about our vulnerabilities and we have about our vulnerabilities and we have about our vulnerabilities and we have the most up-to-date information of our the most up-to-date information of our the most up-to-date information of our own vulnerabilities. Right? So if we own vulnerabilities. Right? So if we own vulnerabilities. Right? So if we rely on other organizations like MVD who rely on other organizations like MVD who rely on other organizations like MVD who have published and said that all their have published and said that all their have published and said that all their metadata inclusion is based on publicly metadata inclusion is based on publicly metadata inclusion is based on publicly available information then they might available information then they might available information then they might not be providing the best information on not be providing the best information on not be providing the best information on those CVEes. And I don't know about those CVEes. And I don't know about those CVEes. And I don't know about anyone else who's in here and is a CNA, anyone else who's in here and is a CNA, anyone else who's in here and is a CNA, but we get a lot of questions from our but we get a lot of questions from our but we get a lot of questions from our customers like why is the CVSS score so customers like why is the CVSS score so customers like why is the CVSS score so different on NVD and why is it a different on NVD and why is it a different on NVD and why is it a critical hair but in your CVE it's just critical hair but in your CVE it's just critical hair but in your CVE it's just a medium. um that that creates a lot of a medium. um that that creates a lot of a medium. um that that creates a lot of uh frustration within our customer uh frustration within our customer uh frustration within our customer support teams because one again you have support teams because one again you have support teams because one again you have to explain what the CV process is and to explain what the CV process is and to explain what the CV process is and then explain to them NVD is a supporting then explain to them NVD is a supporting then explain to them NVD is a supporting body. They um aren't a CNA. They don't body. They um aren't a CNA. They don't body. They um aren't a CNA. They don't have all the information. Um and I had have all the information. Um and I had have all the information. Um and I had to point to this. Now I've lost my train to point to this. Now I've lost my train to point to this. Now I've lost my train of thought. Um but yeah, so we are of thought. Um but yeah, so we are of thought. Um but yeah, so we are helping our customers by providing that helping our customers by providing that helping our customers by providing that information from the get-go. And with information from the get-go. And with information from the get-go. And with the MVD slowdown the MVD slowdown the MVD slowdown announcement, we knew well while I tried announcement, we knew well while I tried announcement, we knew well while I tried to find out from vulnerability scanners to find out from vulnerability scanners to find out from vulnerability scanners themselves, are you using any other APIs themselves, are you using any other APIs themselves, are you using any other APIs to get these CPEs? Because if you're to get these CPEs? Because if you're to get these CPEs? Because if you're only using NVD APIs and they're slowing only using NVD APIs and they're slowing only using NVD APIs and they're slowing down and not adding CPEs, then where are down and not adding CPEs, then where are down and not adding CPEs, then where are you getting those CPEs? How are you you getting those CPEs? How are you you getting those CPEs? How are you going to identify those vulnerabilities going to identify those vulnerabilities going to identify those vulnerabilities on the system? I couldn't really I mean on the system? I couldn't really I mean on the system? I couldn't really I mean I only reached out to the vulnerability I only reached out to the vulnerability I only reached out to the vulnerability scanners that we actively use uh because scanners that we actively use uh because scanners that we actively use uh because they they have a contract with us so you they they have a contract with us so you they they have a contract with us so you know it was a lot easier to reach out to know it was a lot easier to reach out to know it was a lot easier to reach out to them and they couldn't really give us a them and they couldn't really give us a them and they couldn't really give us a straightforward answer. They say yeah we straightforward answer. They say yeah we straightforward answer. They say yeah we use other things but they couldn't tell use other things but they couldn't tell use other things but they couldn't tell me exactly what they use but I hope I me exactly what they use but I hope I me exactly what they use but I hope I answered your question. Yeah. Okay. answered your question. Yeah. Okay. answered your question. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Welcome to everybody's world. Um Yeah. Welcome to everybody's world. Um Yeah. Welcome to everybody's world. Um would you be for would you be for would you be for uh MongoDB owning their own CPEs and uh MongoDB owning their own CPEs and uh MongoDB owning their own CPEs and controlling that data themselves that controlling that data themselves that controlling that data themselves that would be used by NBD and everyone else? would be used by NBD and everyone else? would be used by NBD and everyone else? Um is the question if we own our own CPS Um is the question if we own our own CPS Um is the question if we own our own CPS or would you be pro as a CNA owning your or would you be pro as a CNA owning your or would you be pro as a CNA owning your definition your CPU definitions and definition your CPU definitions and definition your CPU definitions and being able to control what versions are being able to control what versions are being able to control what versions are in there and and how you assign them to in there and and how you assign them to in there and and how you assign them to CV? Well, yeah. Yeah. Well, basically CV? Well, yeah. Yeah. Well, basically CV? Well, yeah. Yeah. Well, basically how MVD does it is that they take the how MVD does it is that they take the how MVD does it is that they take the affected versions already that's in the affected versions already that's in the affected versions already that's in the CVE and they like um create those CPEs CVE and they like um create those CPEs CVE and they like um create those CPEs based on all the versions or what that based on all the versions or what that based on all the versions or what that affected version is and they add those affected version is and they add those affected version is and they add those CPEs based on that itself. So they're CPEs based on that itself. So they're CPEs based on that itself. So they're they're basically oh sometimes okay um they're basically oh sometimes okay um they're basically oh sometimes okay um well I can again I can only speak for well I can again I can only speak for well I can again I can only speak for our own C cvees and we found that um the our own C cvees and we found that um the our own C cvees and we found that um the CBES that they were adding um it was for CBES that they were adding um it was for CBES that they were adding um it was for the affected versions and it should be the affected versions and it should be the affected versions and it should be right because that's why there's that right because that's why there's that right because that's why there's that affected field in the CBE JSON file. um affected field in the CBE JSON file. um affected field in the CBE JSON file. um and those CPEs should uh reflect that and those CPEs should uh reflect that and those CPEs should uh reflect that because that's the product identifier to because that's the product identifier to because that's the product identifier to allow vulnerability scanners to identify allow vulnerability scanners to identify allow vulnerability scanners to identify affected systems. So in a sense, yes, I affected systems. So in a sense, yes, I affected systems. So in a sense, yes, I do think that CNA should be owning do think that CNA should be owning do think that CNA should be owning adding CBES because adding CBES because adding CBES because um that way you kind of negate the um that way you kind of negate the um that way you kind of negate the potential customer questions of why is potential customer questions of why is potential customer questions of why is this affected if you're not if that's this affected if you're not if that's this affected if you're not if that's not what's listed on the CVE not what's listed on the CVE not what's listed on the CVE itself. So by adding those CPEs again, itself. So by adding those CPEs again, itself. So by adding those CPEs again, you have control over um the what is you have control over um the what is you have control over um the what is being said about your vulnerabilities, being said about your vulnerabilities, being said about your vulnerabilities, right? right? right? Uh yeah, I hope that answers the Uh yeah, I hope that answers the Uh yeah, I hope that answers the question. question. question. And more, do you know how many of the recently do you know how many of the recently do you know how many of the recently enriched um CVES with CPEs came from the enriched um CVES with CPEs came from the enriched um CVES with CPEs came from the SIZA ADP versus CNAs? SIZA ADP versus CNAs? SIZA ADP versus CNAs? Um no, I don't actually have that data. Um no, I don't actually have that data. Um no, I don't actually have that data. Um, and I know Andrew actually covered Um, and I know Andrew actually covered Um, and I know Andrew actually covered this in his call in his talk uh this in his call in his talk uh this in his call in his talk uh yesterday, but um I haven't really like yesterday, but um I haven't really like yesterday, but um I haven't really like the the search was mainly for looking at the the search was mainly for looking at the the search was mainly for looking at JSON files that included CPEs actually. JSON files that included CPEs actually. JSON files that included CPEs actually. No, no, no, actually. Yeah, sorry. No, no, no, actually. Yeah, sorry. No, no, no, actually. Yeah, sorry. Correct me. I'm going to correct myself. Correct me. I'm going to correct myself. Correct me. I'm going to correct myself. my my search uh in these JSON fields my my search uh in these JSON fields my my search uh in these JSON fields specified for the CNA container and specified for the CNA container and specified for the CNA container and within the JSON file or the JSON schema within the JSON file or the JSON schema within the JSON file or the JSON schema cell by the CPE cell by the CPE cell by the CPE program. Uh each section uh the CNA program. Uh each section uh the CNA program. Uh each section uh the CNA enrich enriches their own container and enrich enriches their own container and enrich enriches their own container and then the ADP they enrich their own their then the ADP they enrich their own their then the ADP they enrich their own their their container called ADP container. Um their container called ADP container. Um their container called ADP container. Um and actually So in the in the slide here you can see So in the in the slide here you can see So in the in the slide here you can see containers and uh when you're a CNA you containers and uh when you're a CNA you containers and uh when you're a CNA you fill in the CNA container and when fill in the CNA container and when fill in the CNA container and when you're an ADP you fill in the ADB you're an ADP you fill in the ADB you're an ADP you fill in the ADB container. So the search that I used container. So the search that I used container. So the search that I used specified to look at CPEs under the CNA specified to look at CPEs under the CNA specified to look at CPEs under the CNA container. So all the data that I've container. So all the data that I've container. So all the data that I've pulled should be for CPEs included in pulled should be for CPEs included in pulled should be for CPEs included in the CNA container. So the assumption is the CNA container. So the assumption is the CNA container. So the assumption is that the CNA themselves added those that the CNA themselves added those that the CNA themselves added those CPEs. Okay, I think we're done. Thank CPEs. Okay, I think we're done. Thank CPEs. Okay, I think we're done. Thank you so much for joining.
