the last year someone who shut down the airport for couple of days got the award airport for couple of days got the award airport for couple of days got the award during blackout uh okay let's uh take a during blackout uh okay let's uh take a during blackout uh okay let's uh take a look at the data from last year we had look at the data from last year we had look at the data from last year we had just a little over 40,000 vulnerability just a little over 40,000 vulnerability just a little over 40,000 vulnerability in in in 2024 and uh it was 2024 and uh it was 2024 and uh it was 39% jump from a year before and uh right 39% jump from a year before and uh right 39% jump from a year before and uh right before I come to Wongcon I I take a look before I come to Wongcon I I take a look before I come to Wongcon I I take a look at uh how is uh the CVE numbers uh from at uh how is uh the CVE numbers uh from at uh how is uh the CVE numbers uh from last year similar uh time from beginning last year similar uh time from beginning last year similar uh time from beginning of the year to April 3rd it was around of the year to April 3rd it was around of the year to April 3rd it was around 41% more as you can see on the screen it 41% more as you can see on the screen it 41% more as you can see on the screen it was almost 30 13,000 to April 13 which was almost 30 13,000 to April 13 which was almost 30 13,000 to April 13 which similar time it was 9,184 uh and this chart we are showing that uh and this chart we are showing that uh and this chart we are showing that last year surge which it was uh a lot last year surge which it was uh a lot last year surge which it was uh a lot already it wasn't even top 10 in past 20 already it wasn't even top 10 in past 20 already it wasn't even top 10 in past 20 years and we had years that it was way years and we had years that it was way years and we had years that it was way uh higher uh and uh as you can see uh back in uh 2016 2017 because of the uh back in uh 2016 2017 because of the uh back in uh 2016 2017 because of the expansion of uh CNA program that all the expansion of uh CNA program that all the expansion of uh CNA program that all the research organization and different research organization and different research organization and different vendor were able to uh assign CVEEs. uh vendor were able to uh assign CVEEs. uh vendor were able to uh assign CVEEs. uh that was uh one of the year that he has that was uh one of the year that he has that was uh one of the year that he has a huge uh surge 127 and also that year a huge uh surge 127 and also that year a huge uh surge 127 and also that year we had a couple we had a couple we had a couple of really bad ransomware like W cry and of really bad ransomware like W cry and

shell shock going to uh heart bleed and shell shock going to uh heart bleed and shell shock going to last year one of the reason uh that we last year one of the reason uh that we last year one of the reason uh that we had this jump of 39% had this jump of 39% had this jump of 39% uh it's because of the massive attack uh it's because of the massive attack uh it's because of the massive attack surface and lots of software are being surface and lots of software are being surface and lots of software are being created uh on a daily basis with AI and created uh on a daily basis with AI and created uh on a daily basis with AI and also addons discover probably through also addons discover probably through also addons discover probably through AI. That was another fact that we uh we AI. That was another fact that we uh we AI. That was another fact that we uh we noticed and also lots of usage of noticed and also lots of usage of noticed and also lots of usage of uh uh uh cloud. Let's uh take a look at the key cloud. Let's uh take a look at the key cloud. Let's uh take a look at the key trends that we notice trends that we notice trends that we notice uh in uh in uh in 2024. Out of that 40,000 2024. Out of that 40,000 2024. Out of that 40,000 vulnerabilities, we identify that there vulnerabilities, we identify that there vulnerabilities, we identify that there are 245 that it was actually weaponized. are 245 that it was actually weaponized. are 245 that it was actually weaponized. There are lots of different uh term or There are lots of different uh term or There are lots of different uh term or meaning behind weaponize. But when we meaning behind weaponize. But when we meaning behind weaponize. But when we are saying weaponize, it means that that are saying weaponize, it means that that are saying weaponize, it means that that CVE was part of a attack. It was CVE was part of a attack. It was CVE was part of a attack. It was employed in different uh malware employed in different uh malware employed in different uh malware campaign or ransomware. It was already campaign or ransomware. It was already campaign or ransomware. It was already in the world and they were being abused. in the world and they were being abused. in the world and they were being abused. The other fact was Seesaw which uh is The other fact was Seesaw which uh is The other fact was Seesaw which uh is cyber security asset man uh asset cyber cyber security asset man uh asset cyber cyber security asset man uh asset cyber security infrastructure agency uh that security infrastructure agency uh that security infrastructure agency uh that work under uh department of homeland work under uh department of homeland work under uh department of homeland security added 186 uh new CVE. The other security added 186 uh new CVE. The other security added 186 uh new CVE. The other thing that was important is we are thing that was important is we are thing that was important is we are seeing a lot of attention for internetf seeing a lot of attention for internetf seeing a lot of attention for internetf facing assets mainly the VPN and uh facing assets mainly the VPN and uh facing assets mainly the VPN and uh secure access. I will get to the last uh secure access. I will get to the last uh secure access. I will get to the last uh point later. We expect that seesaw add 250 new later. We expect that seesaw add 250 new later. We expect that seesaw add 250 new CVS. It could be all your vulnerability CVS. It could be all your vulnerability CVS. It could be all your vulnerability or it could be uh CVS that being added or it could be uh CVS that being added or it could be uh CVS that being added uh based on past Tuesdays or things like uh based on past Tuesdays or things like uh based on past Tuesdays or things like that. Today is past Tuesday and we that. Today is past Tuesday and we that. Today is past Tuesday and we expect at least four or five new uh CV expect at least four or five new uh CV expect at least four or five new uh CV being added there and 250 is not much being added there and 250 is not much being added there and 250 is not much because if you look at from beginning of because if you look at from beginning of because if you look at from beginning of the year to today there are 75 the year to today there are 75 the year to today there are 75 uh CVE added to CISA and uh I want to uh CVE added to CISA and uh I want to uh CVE added to CISA and uh I want to quickly mention how CISA works because quickly mention how CISA works because quickly mention how CISA works because we we uh we need to talk about that and we we uh we need to talk about that and we we uh we need to talk about that and uh we we have a lot of uh details to uh we we have a lot of uh details to uh we we have a lot of uh details to share. Seesaw uh is not obligated to add share. Seesaw uh is not obligated to add share. Seesaw uh is not obligated to add all these new CVEes, right? because all these new CVEes, right? because all these new CVEes, right? because there's putting a lot of there's putting a lot of there's putting a lot of uh uh pressure on government bodies and uh uh pressure on government bodies and uh uh pressure on government bodies and they are working under uh a binding uh they are working under uh a binding uh they are working under uh a binding uh operation uh called bud 22 uh 01 which operation uh called bud 22 uh 01 which operation uh called bud 22 uh 01 which they have a guideline and they are they have a guideline and they are they have a guideline and they are following that and it means that there following that and it means that there following that and it means that there could be some CVE being weaponized uh could be some CVE being weaponized uh could be some CVE being weaponized uh some other part of the world like I some other part of the world like I some other part of the world like I don't know somewhere that uh US doesn't don't know somewhere that uh US doesn't don't know somewhere that uh US doesn't work with them closely or they are not work with them closely or they are not work with them closely or they are not allied it means that those will not be allied it means that those will not be allied it means that those will not be considered. That's why we have a higher considered. That's why we have a higher considered. That's why we have a higher list of CVES that being weaponized list of CVES that being weaponized list of CVES that being weaponized compared to CISA. And that's uh the part compared to CISA. And that's uh the part compared to CISA. And that's uh the part that is important to mention that uh that is important to mention that uh that is important to mention that uh intelligence is very important and every intelligence is very important and every intelligence is very important and every single vulnerability management need to single vulnerability management need to single vulnerability management need to have have have those in their those in their those in their product. And uh product. And uh product. And uh the very important uh data that we the very important uh data that we the very important uh data that we notice is 64% of CVEes that are being notice is 64% of CVEes that are being notice is 64% of CVEes that are being added to CISA Kev being remediated being added to CISA Kev being remediated being added to CISA Kev being remediated being fixed in 14 days. This is really fixed in 14 days. This is really fixed in 14 days. This is really important. It shows the impact CISA uh important. It shows the impact CISA uh important. It shows the impact CISA uh have on uh these work and we really have on uh these work and we really have on uh these work and we really think that it is important. The other uh think that it is important. The other uh think that it is important. The other uh point that I will show on a chart later point that I will show on a chart later point that I will show on a chart later is 20% of uh vulnerability that is being is 20% of uh vulnerability that is being is 20% of uh vulnerability that is being added to seesaw normally 20% are fixed added to seesaw normally 20% are fixed added to seesaw normally 20% are fixed before even uh seesaw uh added to their before even uh seesaw uh added to their before even uh seesaw uh added to their uh KV list which means that there are uh KV list which means that there are uh KV list which means that there are some proactive uh approach and thread some proactive uh approach and thread some proactive uh approach and thread intelligent involved that those team intelligent involved that those team intelligent involved that those team remediating those quickly. remediating those quickly. remediating those quickly. We we are really liking what CISAI is We we are really liking what CISAI is We we are really liking what CISAI is doing and we really want to congratulate doing and we really want to congratulate doing and we really want to congratulate them for the job well done because the them for the job well done because the them for the job well done because the impact of what they are doing is very impact of what they are doing is very impact of what they are doing is very impactful and is very effective. We are impactful and is very effective. We are impactful and is very effective. We are seeing it across our customer across the seeing it across our customer across the seeing it across our customer across the globe and it it's very interesting to globe and it it's very interesting to globe and it it's very interesting to see that not only US-based customers are see that not only US-based customers are see that not only US-based customers are looking into CISA and there are other uh looking into CISA and there are other uh looking into CISA and there are other uh countries everywhere looking at this countries everywhere looking at this countries everywhere looking at this list on a daily basis and it is a list on a daily basis and it is a list on a daily basis and it is a perization factor for lots of customers perization factor for lots of customers perization factor for lots of customers and uh lots of audience. And uh one very and uh lots of audience. And uh one very and uh lots of audience. And uh one very important fact here is that no matter important fact here is that no matter important fact here is that no matter what kind of uh vulnerability management what kind of uh vulnerability management what kind of uh vulnerability management tool you are using, you have to demand tool you are using, you have to demand tool you are using, you have to demand that they already have the coverage for that they already have the coverage for that they already have the coverage for these C sockets because okay if you just these C sockets because okay if you just these C sockets because okay if you just know that there is a vulnerability is know that there is a vulnerability is know that there is a vulnerability is exploited the and it is bad and you exploited the and it is bad and you exploited the and it is bad and you cannot detect it with your vulnerability cannot detect it with your vulnerability cannot detect it with your vulnerability management then it's pointless because management then it's pointless because management then it's pointless because you need that in order to identify and you need that in order to identify and you need that in order to identify and then prioritize and plan for uh getting then prioritize and plan for uh getting then prioritize and plan for uh getting it fixed. Uh uh we are happy to mention it fixed. Uh uh we are happy to mention it fixed. Uh uh we are happy to mention at Kalis we have 100% coverage of those at Kalis we have 100% coverage of those at Kalis we have 100% coverage of those sea suckers. It is not easy to achieve sea suckers. It is not easy to achieve sea suckers. It is not easy to achieve that but uh it is doable. This is slide. Uh out of that 750 This is slide. Uh out of that 750 This is slide. Uh out of that 750 uh million record that I mentioned uh uh million record that I mentioned uh uh million record that I mentioned uh around 500 plus uh were seesaw kev around 500 plus uh were seesaw kev around 500 plus uh were seesaw kev detection. It means it was detection detection. It means it was detection detection. It means it was detection that happened based on one of those uh C that happened based on one of those uh C that happened based on one of those uh C cycle and the data that we are seeing is cycle and the data that we are seeing is cycle and the data that we are seeing is very eyeopening because we are seeing very eyeopening because we are seeing very eyeopening because we are seeing that on average organization take 30 that on average organization take 30 that on average organization take 30 days 30 and a half days to fix this days 30 and a half days to fix this days 30 and a half days to fix this vulnerability and to see how the vulnerability and to see how the vulnerability and to see how the attackers are doing we take a look at attackers are doing we take a look at attackers are doing we take a look at the 46 vulnerability that we had the the 46 vulnerability that we had the the 46 vulnerability that we had the data in regard to their uh time to data in regard to their uh time to data in regard to their uh time to weaponization. It means the time that it weaponization. It means the time that it weaponization. It means the time that it take to put them in their malware or take to put them in their malware or take to put them in their malware or ransomware kit and on average it take ransomware kit and on average it take ransomware kit and on average it take them 18 and a half days which means that them 18 and a half days which means that them 18 and a half days which means that there's a 12 day window of there's a 12 day window of there's a 12 day window of exploitation and this is average. uh exploitation and this is average. uh exploitation and this is average. uh normally average are uh being hit by normally average are uh being hit by normally average are uh being hit by outliers and when you look at it medium outliers and when you look at it medium outliers and when you look at it medium which is the middle point point of those which is the middle point point of those which is the middle point point of those detection the data show a completely detection the data show a completely detection the data show a completely different story. The attacker take different story. The attacker take different story. The attacker take around five days, five and a half days around five days, five and a half days around five days, five and a half days to uh weaponize the vulnerability and to uh weaponize the vulnerability and to uh weaponize the vulnerability and the our data shows 10 days for our the our data shows 10 days for our the our data shows 10 days for our customers at least to see they are customers at least to see they are customers at least to see they are remediating. But there is a lot uh more remediating. But there is a lot uh more remediating. But there is a lot uh more data that uh I want to show you and also data that uh I want to show you and also data that uh I want to show you and also the the importance of uh T intelligence the the importance of uh T intelligence the the importance of uh T intelligence and the impact of what Seesaw for and the impact of what Seesaw for and the impact of what Seesaw for example is doing is very clearly being example is doing is very clearly being example is doing is very clearly being seen here. We compare the detections seen here. We compare the detections seen here. We compare the detections that uh it was part of Seesaw and also that uh it was part of Seesaw and also that uh it was part of Seesaw and also the detection that it wasn't tagged by the detection that it wasn't tagged by the detection that it wasn't tagged by Seesaw and it wasn't considered as a Seesaw and it wasn't considered as a Seesaw and it wasn't considered as a Seesaw Kev vulnerability. As you can see Seesaw Kev vulnerability. As you can see Seesaw Kev vulnerability. As you can see the data showing that around 4 days the data showing that around 4 days the data showing that around 4 days longer it take for them to get fixed and longer it take for them to get fixed and longer it take for them to get fixed and also the median is around 14 days. uh also the median is around 14 days. uh also the median is around 14 days. uh which it means that there's a longer which it means that there's a longer which it means that there's a longer time uh for uh getting fixed and uh that time uh for uh getting fixed and uh that time uh for uh getting fixed and uh that is uh the part that I want to mention is uh the part that I want to mention is uh the part that I want to mention that all these vulnerability that we that all these vulnerability that we that all these vulnerability that we have here they are all very dangerous have here they are all very dangerous have here they are all very dangerous very bad and also uh weaponized or very bad and also uh weaponized or very bad and also uh weaponized or exploited in the wild and it it really exploited in the wild and it it really exploited in the wild and it it really matter that when your VM company are matter that when your VM company are matter that when your VM company are mentioning that okay these mentioning that okay these mentioning that okay these vulnerabilities is having higher score vulnerabilities is having higher score vulnerabilities is having higher score and is important. You need to really pay and is important. You need to really pay and is important. You need to really pay attention to attention to attention to that. This chart that uh I have here is that. This chart that uh I have here is that. This chart that uh I have here is for that 500 million record that I for that 500 million record that I for that 500 million record that I mentioned that is how they are getting mentioned that is how they are getting mentioned that is how they are getting fixed over time in fixed over time in fixed over time in 202 data. What you are seeing here by 202 data. What you are seeing here by 202 data. What you are seeing here by the time that a CVE being added to CISAP the time that a CVE being added to CISAP the time that a CVE being added to CISAP around 20% of them are already fixed it around 20% of them are already fixed it around 20% of them are already fixed it means that there are some means that there are some means that there are some uh level of intelligence proactive uh level of intelligence proactive uh level of intelligence proactive patching and some automation workflow is patching and some automation workflow is patching and some automation workflow is happening behind the scene that those uh happening behind the scene that those uh happening behind the scene that those uh people already fix their vulnerability people already fix their vulnerability people already fix their vulnerability and this is uh very positive and and this is uh very positive and and this is uh very positive and important But the data is showing that important But the data is showing that important But the data is showing that for example at day 14 64% are fixed for example at day 14 64% are fixed for example at day 14 64% are fixed going to day 30 82% I believe are uh going to day 30 82% I believe are uh going to day 30 82% I believe are uh fixed but the problem is when we are fixed but the problem is when we are fixed but the problem is when we are heading heading heading to day 90 three months in three months to day 90 three months in three months to day 90 three months in three months from the time that seesaw mentioned from the time that seesaw mentioned from the time that seesaw mentioned these are uh exploited in the these are uh exploited in the these are uh exploited in the we still see 95% are fixed is fantastic we still see 95% are fixed is fantastic we still see 95% are fixed is fantastic but the 5% even on the scale of uh the but the 5% even on the scale of uh the but the 5% even on the scale of uh the data that we have it's a lot 25 million data that we have it's a lot 25 million data that we have it's a lot 25 million detection that is not being fixed and detection that is not being fixed and detection that is not being fixed and this goes on and on right by day 180 this goes on and on right by day 180 this goes on and on right by day 180 still one and a half% not fixed and uh still one and a half% not fixed and uh still one and a half% not fixed and uh it's important to use the thread it's important to use the thread it's important to use the thread intelligent that is already built in or intelligent that is already built in or intelligent that is already built in or it's available for you to uh take care it's available for you to uh take care it's available for you to uh take care of these uh vulnerabilities of these uh vulnerabilities of these uh vulnerabilities uh quickly because when they are saying uh quickly because when they are saying uh quickly because when they are saying that we are seeing the active that we are seeing the active that we are seeing the active exploitation happen in the wild that is exploitation happen in the wild that is exploitation happen in the wild that is mean that someone actively looking into mean that someone actively looking into mean that someone actively looking into these vulnerabilities and try to these vulnerabilities and try to these vulnerabilities and try to uh abuse them and it's very important to uh abuse them and it's very important to uh abuse them and it's very important to use risk use risk use risk basization and also adopt a way for basization and also adopt a way for basization and also adopt a way for advanced escoring. I have another slide advanced escoring. I have another slide advanced escoring. I have another slide here that I will show you some of the here that I will show you some of the here that I will show you some of the older framework like CVSS is not even older framework like CVSS is not even older framework like CVSS is not even doing justice or any any helpful they doing justice or any any helpful they doing justice or any any helpful they are not helpful and it's very important are not helpful and it's very important are not helpful and it's very important to adopt advanced scoring system to adopt advanced scoring system to adopt advanced scoring system aorization framework to help you aorization framework to help you aorization framework to help you navigate this better. This is uh another slide that I feel is This is uh another slide that I feel is This is uh another slide that I feel is very important because it clearly very important because it clearly very important because it clearly showing we plot the data for each month showing we plot the data for each month showing we plot the data for each month for seesaw curves and what you are for seesaw curves and what you are for seesaw curves and what you are seeing here is very clear. The moment seeing here is very clear. The moment seeing here is very clear. The moment that the workload that the workload that the workload is enough or low your team normally is enough or low your team normally is enough or low your team normally doing a really good job of taking care doing a really good job of taking care doing a really good job of taking care of those vulnerability. For example, in of those vulnerability. For example, in of those vulnerability. For example, in March and April, it was around 20 March and April, it was around 20 March and April, it was around 20 million detection. And you see that the million detection. And you see that the million detection. And you see that the the data shows that uh the vulnerability the data shows that uh the vulnerability the data shows that uh the vulnerability are being fixed couple of days prior to are being fixed couple of days prior to are being fixed couple of days prior to even being added to cesar. It means the even being added to cesar. It means the even being added to cesar. It means the workload was not that high. The team workload was not that high. The team workload was not that high. The team could manage it. But when you look at could manage it. But when you look at could manage it. But when you look at the months that for example August 120 the months that for example August 120 the months that for example August 120 million vulnerability being shown and million vulnerability being shown and million vulnerability being shown and suddenly the team are also lagging suddenly the team are also lagging suddenly the team are also lagging behind right which uh is behind right which uh is behind right which uh is uh again the story is the data tell us uh again the story is the data tell us uh again the story is the data tell us that you need to to use a parization that you need to to use a parization that you need to to use a parization methods some advanced scoring to say methods some advanced scoring to say methods some advanced scoring to say which of these vulnerabilities is really which of these vulnerabilities is really which of these vulnerabilities is really affecting your environment and you need affecting your environment and you need affecting your environment and you need to pay attention uh quickly because once to pay attention uh quickly because once to pay attention uh quickly because once uh the scale happen what it happens uh uh the scale happen what it happens uh uh the scale happen what it happens uh the team cannot manage and you know the the team cannot manage and you know the the team cannot manage and you know the delay creeping uh we have similar data delay creeping uh we have similar data delay creeping uh we have similar data for non sees and that's even worse for non sees and that's even worse for non sees and that's even worse because then nobody tell you that okay because then nobody tell you that okay because then nobody tell you that okay this is cesar we are telling you that this is cesar we are telling you that this is cesar we are telling you that this is very important but say okay this is very important but say okay this is very important but say okay let's at least focus on cycle that's why let's at least focus on cycle that's why let's at least focus on cycle that's why you are showing We don't even have one you are showing We don't even have one you are showing We don't even have one data point that is showing before since data point that is showing before since data point that is showing before since like I have mentioned or addition like I have mentioned or addition like I have mentioned or addition happened that vulnerability is being uh fixed also very important we take a look fixed also very important we take a look fixed also very important we take a look at different industries and uh these at different industries and uh these at different industries and uh these industry here I believe they are only uh industry here I believe they are only uh industry here I believe they are only uh we are talking uh critical we are talking uh critical we are talking uh critical infrastructure uh infrastructure uh infrastructure uh industries and we take a look at how how industries and we take a look at how how industries and we take a look at how how many unique many unique many unique vulnerabilities are in those vulnerabilities are in those vulnerabilities are in those uh uh different industries. When you uh uh different industries. When you uh uh different industries. When you look at that the number is not high it's look at that the number is not high it's look at that the number is not high it's around 60. It means that your team and around 60. It means that your team and around 60. It means that your team and your focus need to be only on those 60 your focus need to be only on those 60 your focus need to be only on those 60 unique. Yes. Obviously for example in unique. Yes. Obviously for example in unique. Yes. Obviously for example in case of uh transportation or healthcare case of uh transportation or healthcare case of uh transportation or healthcare there is there is there is 34,000 instance per one CVE or uh in 34,000 instance per one CVE or uh in 34,000 instance per one CVE or uh in case of technology is around 10,000. It case of technology is around 10,000. It case of technology is around 10,000. It means that you need to leverage means that you need to leverage means that you need to leverage automation and uh some uh scoring system automation and uh some uh scoring system automation and uh some uh scoring system that it can really show the impact of that it can really show the impact of that it can really show the impact of those and prioritize this. The those and prioritize this. The those and prioritize this. The priorization is not enough but at least priorization is not enough but at least priorization is not enough but at least uh that uh put you ahead. One uh slide I uh that uh put you ahead. One uh slide I uh that uh put you ahead. One uh slide I have here that it clearly show how this have here that it clearly show how this have here that it clearly show how this parization happened and this is uh parization happened and this is uh parization happened and this is uh reality. If you look at it, if your team reality. If you look at it, if your team reality. If you look at it, if your team are trying to uh fix all those 40,000, are trying to uh fix all those 40,000, are trying to uh fix all those 40,000, that's not going to happen. And we all that's not going to happen. And we all that's not going to happen. And we all know and it is also wrong if your team know and it is also wrong if your team know and it is also wrong if your team want to just fix everything that is want to just fix everything that is want to just fix everything that is coming, right? That's not doable. And if coming, right? That's not doable. And if coming, right? That's not doable. And if you just focus on all those uh alert you just focus on all those uh alert you just focus on all those uh alert that is coming is impossible, is not that is coming is impossible, is not that is coming is impossible, is not doable, it's not effective and also it doable, it's not effective and also it doable, it's not effective and also it put you in a bad situation. And the put you in a bad situation. And the put you in a bad situation. And the right way is to focus on top 1% fixing right way is to focus on top 1% fixing right way is to focus on top 1% fixing it on under five days and that is the it on under five days and that is the it on under five days and that is the way that you can be ahead and way that you can be ahead and way that you can be ahead and uh help your organization. The other uh help your organization. The other uh help your organization. The other uh slide I have here also is talking uh slide I have here also is talking uh slide I have here also is talking similar type of uh idea. This is similar type of uh idea. This is similar type of uh idea. This is critical infrastructure section uh critical infrastructure section uh critical infrastructure section uh sectors and how the average and median sectors and how the average and median sectors and how the average and median for those vulnerability are and you can for those vulnerability are and you can for those vulnerability are and you can clearly see that all the attention go. clearly see that all the attention go. clearly see that all the attention go. This is uh by the way on the scale of This is uh by the way on the scale of This is uh by the way on the scale of CVS. It means that uh the critical are CVS. It means that uh the critical are CVS. It means that uh the critical are the one that the CSS was ninth and above the one that the CSS was ninth and above the one that the CSS was ninth and above and the high was 7 to 9 and uh the and the high was 7 to 9 and uh the and the high was 7 to 9 and uh the medium is the rest uh uh I mean four to medium is the rest uh uh I mean four to medium is the rest uh uh I mean four to to seven uh 6.9 and uh as you can see to seven uh 6.9 and uh as you can see to seven uh 6.9 and uh as you can see all the love goes to critical all the love goes to critical all the love goes to critical vulnerabilities and we are clearly see vulnerabilities and we are clearly see vulnerabilities and we are clearly see these are the data for that 320 these are the data for that 320 these are the data for that 320 21 uh vulnerability that I show you all 21 uh vulnerability that I show you all 21 uh vulnerability that I show you all of them are critical to our point of of them are critical to our point of of them are critical to our point of view. If you put it on a scale of CVS, view. If you put it on a scale of CVS, view. If you put it on a scale of CVS, then they are not critical anymore. And then they are not critical anymore. And then they are not critical anymore. And that's why when you are look at the high that's why when you are look at the high that's why when you are look at the high and medium, you see that it's not being and medium, you see that it's not being and medium, you see that it's not being uh uh taken care of very well and uh uh taken care of very well and uh uh taken care of very well and sometimes it take months to to get sometimes it take months to to get sometimes it take months to to get fixed. Uh let me just uh quickly to to fixed. Uh let me just uh quickly to to fixed. Uh let me just uh quickly to to clearly convey this message. Uh we have clearly convey this message. Uh we have clearly convey this message. Uh we have another plot I want to show you. Uh another plot I want to show you. Uh another plot I want to show you. Uh around six months ago CISA had a joint around six months ago CISA had a joint around six months ago CISA had a joint advisory and uh they take a look at the advisory and uh they take a look at the advisory and uh they take a look at the top routinely vulnerability was around top routinely vulnerability was around top routinely vulnerability was around 40 uh vulnerability and they listed 40 uh vulnerability and they listed 40 uh vulnerability and they listed that. I have a plot for this uh CVS. But that. I have a plot for this uh CVS. But that. I have a plot for this uh CVS. But prior to that, I want to explain prior to that, I want to explain prior to that, I want to explain something very something very something very quickly at Qualis. We have a a scoring quickly at Qualis. We have a a scoring quickly at Qualis. We have a a scoring similar to CSS for each vulnerability. I similar to CSS for each vulnerability. I similar to CSS for each vulnerability. I call it QVS. What we do is we getting call it QVS. What we do is we getting call it QVS. What we do is we getting all these thread feeds and then it goes all these thread feeds and then it goes all these thread feeds and then it goes to uh algorithm. We take a look at all to uh algorithm. We take a look at all to uh algorithm. We take a look at all these criteria like CVSS if it's part of these criteria like CVSS if it's part of these criteria like CVSS if it's part of CESA is it ransomware related is it uh CESA is it ransomware related is it uh CESA is it ransomware related is it uh anyone talk uh on dark web about these anyone talk uh on dark web about these anyone talk uh on dark web about these vulnerability or things like that okay vulnerability or things like that okay vulnerability or things like that okay and based on that we assign a score for and based on that we assign a score for and based on that we assign a score for each vulnerability there's not asset each vulnerability there's not asset each vulnerability there's not asset involved nothing it's just based on pure involved nothing it's just based on pure involved nothing it's just based on pure uh characteristic of that vulnerability uh characteristic of that vulnerability uh characteristic of that vulnerability and the data into and the data into and the data into that okay we mentioned that seesaw that okay we mentioned that seesaw that okay we mentioned that seesaw provided these 40 plus CVS right that provided these 40 plus CVS right that provided these 40 plus CVS right that they say is routinely uh being they say is routinely uh being they say is routinely uh being exploited. We took those CVS we removed exploited. We took those CVS we removed exploited. We took those CVS we removed that the one that it was similar scoring that the one that it was similar scoring that the one that it was similar scoring as CVS and also QVS. We remain with this as CVS and also QVS. We remain with this as CVS and also QVS. We remain with this list. What you are seeing here we bring list. What you are seeing here we bring list. What you are seeing here we bring uh we normalize the CVSS to be able to uh we normalize the CVSS to be able to uh we normalize the CVSS to be able to plot this but you can see that out of plot this but you can see that out of plot this but you can see that out of those vulnerability that it was stated those vulnerability that it was stated those vulnerability that it was stated that they're all uh exploited in the that they're all uh exploited in the that they're all uh exploited in the wild. What happened is as you can see wild. What happened is as you can see wild. What happened is as you can see for the first half on the left they are for the first half on the left they are for the first half on the left they are all on the scale of CVSS it's showing all on the scale of CVSS it's showing all on the scale of CVSS it's showing that it's not important just ignore it that it's not important just ignore it that it's not important just ignore it which is not good right when there are which is not good right when there are which is not good right when there are trading in that they are mentioning that trading in that they are mentioning that trading in that they are mentioning that these are need to be prioritized that is these are need to be prioritized that is these are need to be prioritized that is the point by mentioning that when we are the point by mentioning that when we are the point by mentioning that when we are saying advanced risk scoring it means it saying advanced risk scoring it means it saying advanced risk scoring it means it require to have the context of that require to have the context of that require to have the context of that vulnerability to to have a better idea vulnerability to to have a better idea vulnerability to to have a better idea how that vulnerability is being uh being how that vulnerability is being uh being how that vulnerability is being uh being uh uh used and then decide uh uh used and then decide uh uh used and then decide the the other uh data point that I have the the other uh data point that I have the the other uh data point that I have here around two months ago uh one of the here around two months ago uh one of the here around two months ago uh one of the ransomware groups uh black boss they had ransomware groups uh black boss they had ransomware groups uh black boss they had an internal uh conflict and what an internal uh conflict and what an internal uh conflict and what happened was uh someone they leak happened was uh someone they leak happened was uh someone they leak 200,000 messages of their 200,000 messages of their 200,000 messages of their internal chat the chat that they were internal chat the chat that they were internal chat the chat that they were similar to our Slack and uh teams that similar to our Slack and uh teams that similar to our Slack and uh teams that they were discussing all these uh they were discussing all these uh they were discussing all these uh vulnerabilities how not vulnerability vulnerabilities how not vulnerability vulnerabilities how not vulnerability mainly the oper day-to-day operation how mainly the oper day-to-day operation how mainly the oper day-to-day operation how they take care of this how they write they take care of this how they write they take care of this how they write the email how to extort how to u send the email how to extort how to u send the email how to extort how to u send the fishing email they had a lot of talk the fishing email they had a lot of talk the fishing email they had a lot of talk about different uh uh tax fishing and about different uh uh tax fishing and about different uh uh tax fishing and things like that we take a look at that things like that we take a look at that things like that we take a look at that uh data it is over 1.3 million line of uh data it is over 1.3 million line of uh data it is over 1.3 million line of uh uh text that they share. There were uh uh text that they share. There were uh uh text that they share. There were uh vulnerability that stand out that uh vulnerability that stand out that uh vulnerability that stand out that they were talking about. Before I go to they were talking about. Before I go to they were talking about. Before I go to those uh vulnerability, I have one slide those uh vulnerability, I have one slide those uh vulnerability, I have one slide here but uh due to interest of time I'm here but uh due to interest of time I'm here but uh due to interest of time I'm not able to talk about it but uh it's not able to talk about it but uh it's not able to talk about it but uh it's here for you later. These are the top here for you later. These are the top here for you later. These are the top CVEs that they discuss and also top uh CVEs that they discuss and also top uh CVEs that they discuss and also top uh misconfiguration that uh they uh talk misconfiguration that uh they uh talk misconfiguration that uh they uh talk about. We can uh take a look at it about. We can uh take a look at it about. We can uh take a look at it later. We took two of those uh CVS out later. We took two of those uh CVS out later. We took two of those uh CVS out of 62 and we take a look at it to see of 62 and we take a look at it to see of 62 and we take a look at it to see how uh they are being uh fixed. Uh and how uh they are being uh fixed. Uh and how uh they are being uh fixed. Uh and this is the result. First of all, this this is the result. First of all, this this is the result. First of all, this CVE in Jenkins, CISA added it to their CVE in Jenkins, CISA added it to their CVE in Jenkins, CISA added it to their uh CISA c they specifically stated that uh CISA c they specifically stated that uh CISA c they specifically stated that it is uh part of ransomware campaign and it is uh part of ransomware campaign and it is uh part of ransomware campaign and they they had it uh all those uh they they had it uh all those uh they they had it uh all those uh proactive proactive proactive uh uh discussion already happened. uh uh discussion already happened. uh uh discussion already happened. When you look at the data, this is the When you look at the data, this is the When you look at the data, this is the data that shows how it got fixed over data that shows how it got fixed over data that shows how it got fixed over time. And if you look at it on the day time. And if you look at it on the day time. And if you look at it on the day zero when you you can uh on day zero you zero when you you can uh on day zero you zero when you you can uh on day zero you see that around 50% of the customer the see that around 50% of the customer the see that around 50% of the customer the data that we have they find out that data that we have they find out that data that we have they find out that okay this is bad they are saying is okay this is bad they are saying is okay this is bad they are saying is really hurting and they go and they really hurting and they go and they really hurting and they go and they detect it and then they fix. But when detect it and then they fix. But when detect it and then they fix. But when you look at the median, it take 47 days you look at the median, it take 47 days you look at the median, it take 47 days to get fixed. And when you look at the to get fixed. And when you look at the to get fixed. And when you look at the data, it's showing that there are cases data, it's showing that there are cases data, it's showing that there are cases that advanc uh scoring being ignored or that advanc uh scoring being ignored or that advanc uh scoring being ignored or uh there are complications that they uh there are complications that they uh there are complications that they couldn't move fast which uh I will couldn't move fast which uh I will couldn't move fast which uh I will explain some of explain some of explain some of it. And also this chart uh uh basically it. And also this chart uh uh basically it. And also this chart uh uh basically they call this uh survival analysis they call this uh survival analysis they call this uh survival analysis Jacob who had uh two session yesterday Jacob who had uh two session yesterday Jacob who had uh two session yesterday and he's also a co-chair of uh EPSS had and he's also a co-chair of uh EPSS had and he's also a co-chair of uh EPSS had a really good blog on the technical of a really good blog on the technical of a really good blog on the technical of that uh I listed here uh in case you that uh I listed here uh in case you that uh I listed here uh in case you want to plot something like this okay uh want to plot something like this okay uh want to plot something like this okay uh let's take a look at the G this jet let's take a look at the G this jet let's take a look at the G this jet brain similar story part of ransomware brain similar story part of ransomware brain similar story part of ransomware CISA added And the data our third intelligence shows that data our third intelligence shows that data our third intelligence shows that three day this three day this three day this vulnerability start being abused 3 days vulnerability start being abused 3 days vulnerability start being abused 3 days prior to even CISA mentioning that or prior to even CISA mentioning that or prior to even CISA mentioning that or being public that is being abused and if being public that is being abused and if being public that is being abused and if you look at it by day zero you look at it by day zero you look at it by day zero 58% I believe that's the the number that 58% I believe that's the the number that 58% I believe that's the the number that you are seeing that it's still uh the you are seeing that it's still uh the you are seeing that it's still uh the 58% got fixed but 42% is still being uh 58% got fixed but 42% is still being uh 58% got fixed but 42% is still being uh open and the median the number in the open and the median the number in the open and the median the number in the middle for uh those to being fixed is 39 middle for uh those to being fixed is 39 middle for uh those to being fixed is 39 days. It means you need to be on the days. It means you need to be on the days. It means you need to be on the side that it got fixed on the same day side that it got fixed on the same day side that it got fixed on the same day because we have the detection you because we have the detection you because we have the detection you already have the patch and all the data. already have the patch and all the data. already have the patch and all the data. It just uh it means that you need to It just uh it means that you need to It just uh it means that you need to have a solid uh workflow in order to have a solid uh workflow in order to have a solid uh workflow in order to take care of that. Plus your tool need take care of that. Plus your tool need take care of that. Plus your tool need to have integrated thread intelligence to have integrated thread intelligence to have integrated thread intelligence and provide you a speedy remediation. and provide you a speedy remediation. and provide you a speedy remediation. The other uh data point that we take a The other uh data point that we take a The other uh data point that we take a look is uh patch management. And I look is uh patch management. And I look is uh patch management. And I believe the patch management these these believe the patch management these these believe the patch management these these days is not optional because when days is not optional because when days is not optional because when something can help you automate your something can help you automate your something can help you automate your patching or your workflow patching or your workflow patching or your workflow and put you and put you and put you ahead, this should be part of your uh ahead, this should be part of your uh ahead, this should be part of your uh toolkit. And when we look at the data, I toolkit. And when we look at the data, I toolkit. And when we look at the data, I have another chart to show you. We are have another chart to show you. We are have another chart to show you. We are seeing that for the customers of us when seeing that for the customers of us when seeing that for the customers of us when we take a look at the data for them that we take a look at the data for them that we take a look at the data for them that they are using patch management and the they are using patch management and the they are using patch management and the one that they are not using patch one that they are not using patch one that they are not using patch management we are seeing that the one management we are seeing that the one management we are seeing that the one that they are leveraging patch that they are leveraging patch that they are leveraging patch management they are clearly ahead. And management they are clearly ahead. And management they are clearly ahead. And here is a chart. Five of these here is a chart. Five of these here is a chart. Five of these vulnerabilities are part of Seesaw. the vulnerabilities are part of Seesaw. the vulnerabilities are part of Seesaw. the other three I believe one of the Linux other three I believe one of the Linux other three I believe one of the Linux are the not the the one that is not part are the not the the one that is not part are the not the the one that is not part of CISO uh you can see that they are of CISO uh you can see that they are of CISO uh you can see that they are sometimes being sometimes being sometimes being remediated 20 plus days faster and remediated 20 plus days faster and remediated 20 plus days faster and that's why the patch management is a it that's why the patch management is a it that's why the patch management is a it should be considered as a proactive should be considered as a proactive should be considered as a proactive defense strategy for what you do and defense strategy for what you do and defense strategy for what you do and because it help you shorten that because it help you shorten that because it help you shorten that exposure window very quickly. And uh the exposure window very quickly. And uh the exposure window very quickly. And uh the other data point that uh I want to other data point that uh I want to other data point that uh I want to mention here is it's not all about patch mention here is it's not all about patch mention here is it's not all about patch because you need to have a good patch because you need to have a good patch because you need to have a good patch and remediation and remediation and remediation uh system in place uh system in place uh system in place because it's not reality if we expect because it's not reality if we expect because it's not reality if we expect every single system to be patched every single system to be patched every single system to be patched because there are cases that you cannot because there are cases that you cannot because there are cases that you cannot patch. Simple as that, right? But you patch. Simple as that, right? But you patch. Simple as that, right? But you need to have a system to help you need to have a system to help you need to have a system to help you mitigate it in some ways. Okay, you mitigate it in some ways. Okay, you mitigate it in some ways. Okay, you cannot patch for whatever reason, but cannot patch for whatever reason, but cannot patch for whatever reason, but you need to quickly mitigate that risk you need to quickly mitigate that risk you need to quickly mitigate that risk by uh running a workaround or some by uh running a workaround or some by uh running a workaround or some mitigation script or uh if you cannot do mitigation script or uh if you cannot do mitigation script or uh if you cannot do either of that, you should be able to either of that, you should be able to either of that, you should be able to quickly isolate that, right? Or the quickly isolate that, right? Or the quickly isolate that, right? Or the other thing that is very important is other thing that is very important is other thing that is very important is okay we cannot do any of that maybe you okay we cannot do any of that maybe you okay we cannot do any of that maybe you can just disable that feature but again can just disable that feature but again can just disable that feature but again the reality is these things are not very the reality is these things are not very the reality is these things are not very easy to do and the IT system uh and IT easy to do and the IT system uh and IT easy to do and the IT system uh and IT team normally afraid of doing that team normally afraid of doing that team normally afraid of doing that because what if we disable that because what if we disable that because what if we disable that component and something goes wrong. Yes. component and something goes wrong. Yes. component and something goes wrong. Yes. And that's completely valid uh way of And that's completely valid uh way of And that's completely valid uh way of think thinking of that. That's the part think thinking of that. That's the part think thinking of that. That's the part that I'm I'm saying that you need to that I'm I'm saying that you need to that I'm I'm saying that you need to have a good patch management and have a good patch management and have a good patch management and advanced remediation tools in order to advanced remediation tools in order to advanced remediation tools in order to be uh successful and quick about this uh be uh successful and quick about this uh be uh successful and quick about this uh prioritization and fixing because we so prioritization and fixing because we so prioritization and fixing because we so far we talked about a lot about far we talked about a lot about far we talked about a lot about prioritization but parization without uh prioritization but parization without uh prioritization but parization without uh doing something fixing something doesn't doing something fixing something doesn't doing something fixing something doesn't uh mean much and that's why for example uh mean much and that's why for example uh mean much and that's why for example at we have a tool called two risk at we have a tool called two risk at we have a tool called two risk eliminate. What it does is part of patch eliminate. What it does is part of patch eliminate. What it does is part of patch management. It give you the option patch management. It give you the option patch management. It give you the option patch it if you can. If you cannot patch it, it if you can. If you cannot patch it, it if you can. If you cannot patch it, go have all these 10 different approach go have all these 10 different approach go have all these 10 different approach isolated put the mitigation script and isolated put the mitigation script and isolated put the mitigation script and everything are tested and in a similar everything are tested and in a similar everything are tested and in a similar uh environment as a production in order uh environment as a production in order uh environment as a production in order to have a uh piece of mind for you to to have a uh piece of mind for you to to have a uh piece of mind for you to that oh okay if your team run this that oh okay if your team run this that oh okay if your team run this script and something goes wrong we we script and something goes wrong we we script and something goes wrong we we already tested all of that and you can already tested all of that and you can already tested all of that and you can remove something you can uninstall you remove something you can uninstall you remove something you can uninstall you can isolate and things like I want to also part of uh the chat we I want to also part of uh the chat we I want to also part of uh the chat we just had that we mentioned that uh just had that we mentioned that uh just had that we mentioned that uh sometimes is not uh realistic to patch sometimes is not uh realistic to patch sometimes is not uh realistic to patch it right and that's true and that's part it right and that's true and that's part it right and that's true and that's part of the complications that we are seeing of the complications that we are seeing of the complications that we are seeing these two advisory both of them the these two advisory both of them the these two advisory both of them the Citrix one and the eventant one both of Citrix one and the eventant one both of Citrix one and the eventant one both of them are part of them are part of them are part of uh a seessaw cap uh a seessaw cap uh a seessaw cap But if you look at it, the advisory But if you look at it, the advisory But if you look at it, the advisory mentioned that these versions mentioned that these versions mentioned that these versions are end of are end of are end of life. That is the point that you need to life. That is the point that you need to life. That is the point that you need to have a good asset inventory and life have a good asset inventory and life have a good asset inventory and life cycle management integrated to your cycle management integrated to your cycle management integrated to your vulnerability management. Because if vulnerability management. Because if vulnerability management. Because if your team already know what what are your team already know what what are your team already know what what are those machines, where are located, what those machines, where are located, what those machines, where are located, what is their status of end of life, is it is their status of end of life, is it is their status of end of life, is it approaching, is it not approaching, is approaching, is it not approaching, is approaching, is it not approaching, is are you good? Because if your are you good? Because if your are you good? Because if your vulnerability management team come and vulnerability management team come and vulnerability management team come and say, okay, we have a critical say, okay, we have a critical say, okay, we have a critical vulnerability in Citrix and you need to vulnerability in Citrix and you need to vulnerability in Citrix and you need to patch it patch it patch it today. Okay, there's two category. one today. Okay, there's two category. one today. Okay, there's two category. one the one that I show you in the first day the one that I show you in the first day the one that I show you in the first day got detected and also remediated 50% 58% got detected and also remediated 50% 58% got detected and also remediated 50% 58% sometimes sometimes sometimes uh based on those two cases and the uh based on those two cases and the uh based on those two cases and the other part is going to take longer why other part is going to take longer why other part is going to take longer why because your team say oh there is no because your team say oh there is no because your team say oh there is no patch for this we didn't know that this patch for this we didn't know that this patch for this we didn't know that this is end of life no your asset management is end of life no your asset management is end of life no your asset management said okay but it never get the data from said okay but it never get the data from said okay but it never get the data from asset management to my vulnerability asset management to my vulnerability asset management to my vulnerability management to pick up that. Right? These management to pick up that. Right? These management to pick up that. Right? These are the point that when we mentioning are the point that when we mentioning are the point that when we mentioning that it need to be fully integrated in that it need to be fully integrated in that it need to be fully integrated in order to work to your advantage and that order to work to your advantage and that order to work to your advantage and that is is is uh really important part because without uh really important part because without uh really important part because without a good asset inventory you are blind and a good asset inventory you are blind and a good asset inventory you are blind and uh you're going to lack the uh uh you're going to lack the uh uh you're going to lack the uh visibility and definitely when something visibility and definitely when something visibility and definitely when something like this happen a chaos happen and uh like this happen a chaos happen and uh like this happen a chaos happen and uh your risk exposure gonna increase but your risk exposure gonna increase but your risk exposure gonna increase but and the only way is to have a uh and the only way is to have a uh and the only way is to have a uh integrated uh life cycle and asset integrated uh life cycle and asset integrated uh life cycle and asset inventory in order to do that. Let me inventory in order to do that. Let me inventory in order to do that. Let me just head to the public facing VPN and just head to the public facing VPN and just head to the public facing VPN and secure access because we are seeing a secure access because we are seeing a secure access because we are seeing a lot of interest from the adversaries on lot of interest from the adversaries on lot of interest from the adversaries on this and it's clearly not getting enough this and it's clearly not getting enough this and it's clearly not getting enough attention and attention and attention and u the data showing that and basically u the data showing that and basically u the data showing that and basically what we are seeing what we are seeing what we are seeing that anything public facing is a prime that anything public facing is a prime that anything public facing is a prime target and they are being abused. used target and they are being abused. used target and they are being abused. used on a daily basis. And one thing that you on a daily basis. And one thing that you on a daily basis. And one thing that you need to need to need to uh to the way that you need to look at uh to the way that you need to look at uh to the way that you need to look at it is those public facing are similar to it is those public facing are similar to it is those public facing are similar to a storefront is very visible. is very a storefront is very visible. is very a storefront is very visible. is very easy to see. It's bright easy to see. It's bright easy to see. It's bright and the the problem is you can also and the the problem is you can also and the the problem is you can also imagine that they are very easy imagine that they are very easy imagine that they are very easy to smash and chip done a really good job to smash and chip done a really good job to smash and chip done a really good job with that uh image uh with a smashing with that uh image uh with a smashing with that uh image uh with a smashing thing. thing. thing. But we take a look at data uh to But we take a look at data uh to But we take a look at data uh to see how these vulnerability public see how these vulnerability public see how these vulnerability public facing VPN secure access uh are doing. facing VPN secure access uh are doing. facing VPN secure access uh are doing. We take a look at this and we had around We take a look at this and we had around We take a look at this and we had around 100,000 100,000 100,000 uh instance of VPN related uh instance of VPN related uh instance of VPN related vulnerabilities and we plot this and as vulnerabilities and we plot this and as vulnerabilities and we plot this and as you can see here we are seeing that out of those here we are seeing that out of those here we are seeing that out of those 100,000 100,000 100,000 vulnerability they got fixed very quick vulnerability they got fixed very quick vulnerability they got fixed very quick as you can see at day uh I believe this as you can see at day uh I believe this as you can see at day uh I believe this is a 42% and then uh day zero is a 42% and then uh day zero is a 42% and then uh day zero And this seven 50% are nonremediated. It And this seven 50% are nonremediated. It And this seven 50% are nonremediated. It means you already know that there is a means you already know that there is a means you already know that there is a vulnerability in those public facing in vulnerability in those public facing in vulnerability in those public facing in this case VPN secure access that they this case VPN secure access that they this case VPN secure access that they are uh being abused and exploited but are uh being abused and exploited but are uh being abused and exploited but your team are not able to move fast your team are not able to move fast your team are not able to move fast and as you can see it gets better very and as you can see it gets better very and as you can see it gets better very quick but even on day 30 you still see quick but even on day 30 you still see quick but even on day 30 you still see 13% are not being fixed although it's 13% are not being fixed although it's 13% are not being fixed although it's part of a cisakv it's already a zero day part of a cisakv it's already a zero day part of a cisakv it's already a zero day or a lot of discussion about it. But or a lot of discussion about it. But or a lot of discussion about it. But what we are seeing here is what we are seeing here is what we are seeing here is that they are not being uh taken care of that they are not being uh taken care of that they are not being uh taken care of uh fast enough. Uh I think this slide uh fast enough. Uh I think this slide uh fast enough. Uh I think this slide going to show uh a clear going to show uh a clear going to show uh a clear message. What we are saying out of those message. What we are saying out of those message. What we are saying out of those 100,000 instance for VPN and secure 100,000 instance for VPN and secure 100,000 instance for VPN and secure access the access the access the attacker it take them on average 16 and attacker it take them on average 16 and attacker it take them on average 16 and a half days to put those CVEs and put a half days to put those CVEs and put a half days to put those CVEs and put those uh bugs into their uh workflow uh those uh bugs into their uh workflow uh those uh bugs into their uh workflow uh in their automation in their malware in their automation in their malware in their automation in their malware kit for on average it took 39 days kit for on average it took 39 days kit for on average it took 39 days there's again two group one around 42% there's again two group one around 42% there's again two group one around 42% fix same day that is being identified fix same day that is being identified fix same day that is being identified but on average 39 days yes during that but on average 39 days yes during that but on average 39 days yes during that 39 uh days 88% 39 uh days 88% 39 uh days 88% uh remain uh remain uh remain uh uh uh vulnerable and for VPN and uh secure vulnerable and for VPN and uh secure vulnerable and for VPN and uh secure access there are access there are access there are uh lots of ways to eliminate the risk uh lots of ways to eliminate the risk uh lots of ways to eliminate the risk quickly and one of them is to patch. quickly and one of them is to patch. quickly and one of them is to patch. Make sure always you have the latest uh Make sure always you have the latest uh Make sure always you have the latest uh uh uh updates and also replace the end uh uh updates and also replace the end uh uh updates and also replace the end of life. of life. of life. The the other thing that you can do is The the other thing that you can do is The the other thing that you can do is having a multiffactor authentication having a multiffactor authentication having a multiffactor authentication have the certificate for your uh client have the certificate for your uh client have the certificate for your uh client certificate in order to have additional certificate in order to have additional certificate in order to have additional security plus you need to disable security plus you need to disable security plus you need to disable anything that is not important to you anything that is not important to you anything that is not important to you and the when you look at these uh VPN and the when you look at these uh VPN and the when you look at these uh VPN vulnerabilities most of the case they're vulnerabilities most of the case they're vulnerabilities most of the case they're talking about uh the UI the admin access talking about uh the UI the admin access talking about uh the UI the admin access and there are ways for for you to take and there are ways for for you to take and there are ways for for you to take those off the internet. Make sure that those off the internet. Make sure that those off the internet. Make sure that there is some sort of uh authentication there is some sort of uh authentication there is some sort of uh authentication or VPN or something else needed or you or VPN or something else needed or you or VPN or something else needed or you being part of uh the network and your being part of uh the network and your being part of uh the network and your corporate network in order to access corporate network in order to access corporate network in order to access that plus uh having a good log that plus uh having a good log that plus uh having a good log management plus uh leveraging IDS IPS it management plus uh leveraging IDS IPS it management plus uh leveraging IDS IPS it would be really interesting uh way to would be really interesting uh way to would be really interesting uh way to tackle tackle tackle that. I think the only important part of that. I think the only important part of that. I think the only important part of this presentation would be this slide this presentation would be this slide this presentation would be this slide that you need that you need that you need to leverage space uh to leverage space uh to leverage space uh perization and in order to tackle the perization and in order to tackle the perization and in order to tackle the top 1% that they are really matter and top 1% that they are really matter and top 1% that they are really matter and it's important and you need to do that it's important and you need to do that it's important and you need to do that under five days because that is the time under five days because that is the time under five days because that is the time that we know most of those uh that we know most of those uh that we know most of those uh vulnerabilities being uh weaponized and vulnerabilities being uh weaponized and vulnerabilities being uh weaponized and being used in different uh malware or uh being used in different uh malware or uh being used in different uh malware or uh ransomware campaign. And you need to ransomware campaign. And you need to ransomware campaign. And you need to have a good solid plan both from asset have a good solid plan both from asset have a good solid plan both from asset inventory detection and all of that. And inventory detection and all of that. And inventory detection and all of that. And this is my uh next next slide that maybe this is my uh next next slide that maybe this is my uh next next slide that maybe you ask how we can achieve that because you ask how we can achieve that because you ask how we can achieve that because that is the one that uh is really that is the one that uh is really that is the one that uh is really important and the the key point here is important and the the key point here is important and the the key point here is that vulnerability management a solid that vulnerability management a solid that vulnerability management a solid good mature vulnerability management is good mature vulnerability management is good mature vulnerability management is not optional and you cannot uh file with not optional and you cannot uh file with not optional and you cannot uh file with it. You need to have that and plus the it. You need to have that and plus the it. You need to have that and plus the other key challenge here is that you you other key challenge here is that you you other key challenge here is that you you shouldn't fix everything and that is not shouldn't fix everything and that is not shouldn't fix everything and that is not acceptable is not uh doable or is not acceptable is not uh doable or is not acceptable is not uh doable or is not effective at all. And in order to do effective at all. And in order to do effective at all. And in order to do that you need to have a holistic that you need to have a holistic that you need to have a holistic approach. And by that this is a Wcon and approach. And by that this is a Wcon and approach. And by that this is a Wcon and we talk about all about vulnerabilities. we talk about all about vulnerabilities. we talk about all about vulnerabilities. But the key part here is But the key part here is But the key part here is that you need to have a good that you need to have a good that you need to have a good understanding of your inventory. Where understanding of your inventory. Where understanding of your inventory. Where are your uh all those uh assets? Because are your uh all those uh assets? Because are your uh all those uh assets? Because in today environment software power in today environment software power in today environment software power almost everything and that fuel every almost everything and that fuel every almost everything and that fuel every single industry and that means a lot of single industry and that means a lot of single industry and that means a lot of vulnerability and we just saw in the vulnerability and we just saw in the vulnerability and we just saw in the first or second first or second first or second uh second uh slide. The other thing is uh second uh slide. The other thing is uh second uh slide. The other thing is uh a detection. You need to have a broad uh a detection. You need to have a broad uh a detection. You need to have a broad detection. That's in two different ways. detection. That's in two different ways. detection. That's in two different ways. one it means that every single asset one it means that every single asset one it means that every single asset that you have need to be uh quickly that you have need to be uh quickly that you have need to be uh quickly identified and detected. Sometimes you identified and detected. Sometimes you identified and detected. Sometimes you cannot detect a VPN uh server uh or uh cannot detect a VPN uh server uh or uh cannot detect a VPN uh server uh or uh Cisco device with the agent right and Cisco device with the agent right and Cisco device with the agent right and you need to have a network scanner, you you need to have a network scanner, you you need to have a network scanner, you need to have a comp uh container need to have a comp uh container need to have a comp uh container security and also you need to have a security and also you need to have a security and also you need to have a good uh host detection. Plus when you good uh host detection. Plus when you good uh host detection. Plus when you have all this coverage of identifying have all this coverage of identifying have all this coverage of identifying the vulnerabilities in across different the vulnerabilities in across different the vulnerabilities in across different uh tools or product then you need to uh tools or product then you need to uh tools or product then you need to have a really good vulnerability have a really good vulnerability have a really good vulnerability management to take care of all those management to take care of all those management to take care of all those vulnerability for you to quickly add vulnerability for you to quickly add vulnerability for you to quickly add those vulnerability and have the those vulnerability and have the those vulnerability and have the coverage a coverage a coverage a accurate coverage for you. And once that accurate coverage for you. And once that accurate coverage for you. And once that coverage is there then you get to the coverage is there then you get to the coverage is there then you get to the point that you need to have some level point that you need to have some level point that you need to have some level of enrichment for those uh vulnerability of enrichment for those uh vulnerability of enrichment for those uh vulnerability in order to give you uh the best tool in in order to give you uh the best tool in in order to give you uh the best tool in order to help you through the whole order to help you through the whole order to help you through the whole process. And that part is enrichment. It process. And that part is enrichment. It process. And that part is enrichment. It means that we as a vulnerability uh means that we as a vulnerability uh means that we as a vulnerability uh management company we're going to tell management company we're going to tell management company we're going to tell you that this is a vulnerability in this you that this is a vulnerability in this you that this is a vulnerability in this asset and you need to pay attention asset and you need to pay attention asset and you need to pay attention because the asset is a critical asset because the asset is a critical asset because the asset is a critical asset part of accounting and then we have this part of accounting and then we have this part of accounting and then we have this vulnerability that is being actively uh vulnerability that is being actively uh vulnerability that is being actively uh exploited right this is the context that exploited right this is the context that exploited right this is the context that you need in order to make a decision and you need in order to make a decision and you need in order to make a decision and then with all these detection and then with all these detection and then with all these detection and enrichment that is the time for example enrichment that is the time for example enrichment that is the time for example One part that we have is that we are uh One part that we have is that we are uh One part that we have is that we are uh having a mapping for miter attack and uh having a mapping for miter attack and uh having a mapping for miter attack and uh techniques tactics and techniques. These techniques tactics and techniques. These techniques tactics and techniques. These are the one that we are showing you how are the one that we are showing you how are the one that we are showing you how they are being mapped, how they are they are being mapped, how they are they are being mapped, how they are being uh used and all of that with a being uh used and all of that with a being uh used and all of that with a good scoring to help you today. My team good scoring to help you today. My team good scoring to help you today. My team going to take care of this and nothing going to take care of this and nothing going to take care of this and nothing else. And once you have all of that uh else. And once you have all of that uh else. And once you have all of that uh you you need to prioritize and in order you you need to prioritize and in order you you need to prioritize and in order to prioritize you need to know okay if I to prioritize you need to know okay if I to prioritize you need to know okay if I have 10 vulnerability all are pressing have 10 vulnerability all are pressing have 10 vulnerability all are pressing which one right that is the question which one right that is the question which one right that is the question that you shouldn't answer that's the that you shouldn't answer that's the that you shouldn't answer that's the question that once you have a good question that once you have a good question that once you have a good vulnerability management in place your vulnerability management in place your vulnerability management in place your tool need to tell you that right because tool need to tell you that right because tool need to tell you that right because then that tool knows everything the then that tool knows everything the then that tool knows everything the asset and the context around it and asset and the context around it and asset and the context around it and lastly lastly lastly You already know all your inventory. You You already know all your inventory. You You already know all your inventory. You have a good detection and then you need have a good detection and then you need have a good detection and then you need to just uh take care of everything after to just uh take care of everything after to just uh take care of everything after parization by remediating it. That means parization by remediating it. That means parization by remediating it. That means that you need to fix it that you need to fix it that you need to fix it because you need to derisk your because you need to derisk your because you need to derisk your environment and it could be a patch. It environment and it could be a patch. It environment and it could be a patch. It could be uh some script running to get could be uh some script running to get could be uh some script running to get mitigate or isolated because mitigation mitigate or isolated because mitigation mitigate or isolated because mitigation it might help you with your risk it might help you with your risk it might help you with your risk reduction reduction reduction but it doesn't help you with your but it doesn't help you with your but it doesn't help you with your compliance. If you want to be compliant, compliance. If you want to be compliant, compliance. If you want to be compliant, you need to fix that vulnerability in 30 you need to fix that vulnerability in 30 you need to fix that vulnerability in 30 days. Otherwise it going to be difficult days. Otherwise it going to be difficult days. Otherwise it going to be difficult and that is the point and that is the point and that is the point that you need to have an integrated that you need to have an integrated that you need to have an integrated platform in order to have these in place platform in order to have these in place platform in order to have these in place in order to tackle that 1% of top in order to tackle that 1% of top in order to tackle that 1% of top important vulnerabilities or uh issues important vulnerabilities or uh issues important vulnerabilities or uh issues in your platform plus uh fixing them in your platform plus uh fixing them in your platform plus uh fixing them under five days if you want to be ahead under five days if you want to be ahead under five days if you want to be ahead of uh the uh the adversaries and uh our of uh the uh the adversaries and uh our of uh the uh the adversaries and uh our team Aqualis uh they put together team Aqualis uh they put together team Aqualis uh they put together something exclusive for this session. something exclusive for this session. something exclusive for this session. It's a bunch of uh asset inventory It's a bunch of uh asset inventory It's a bunch of uh asset inventory vulnerability detection and patch and vulnerability detection and patch and vulnerability detection and patch and remediation all those together. If remediation all those together. If remediation all those together. If anyone want to uh test that uh to see anyone want to uh test that uh to see anyone want to uh test that uh to see how it look like, compare it or get in how it look like, compare it or get in how it look like, compare it or get in touch or talk to someone uh to just get touch or talk to someone uh to just get touch or talk to someone uh to just get a better understanding how integrated a better understanding how integrated a better understanding how integrated system can uh really help uh with that. system can uh really help uh with that. system can uh really help uh with that. And And And uh that was uh uh that was uh uh that was uh the conversation that I want to have the conversation that I want to have the conversation that I want to have based on the data that uh it was uh we based on the data that uh it was uh we based on the data that uh it was uh we we we saw that this is very important. we we saw that this is very important. we we saw that this is very important. It was very eye opening for even us It was very eye opening for even us It was very eye opening for even us sometimes to take a look at how things sometimes to take a look at how things sometimes to take a look at how things are being remediated. We definitely are being remediated. We definitely are being remediated. We definitely leveraging this data to help our leveraging this data to help our leveraging this data to help our customers and uh because it clearly customers and uh because it clearly customers and uh because it clearly showing that showing that showing that uh there uh there uh there are cases that is being fixed quickly are cases that is being fixed quickly are cases that is being fixed quickly but there are cases that there is but there are cases that there is but there are cases that there is complication and maybe we can help and complication and maybe we can help and complication and maybe we can help and uh I want to uh thank everyone to uh uh I want to uh thank everyone to uh uh I want to uh thank everyone to uh that they listened. It was a long uh that they listened. It was a long uh that they listened. It was a long uh conversation and we are planning to have conversation and we are planning to have conversation and we are planning to have a report uh based on this data out uh a report uh based on this data out uh a report uh based on this data out uh you can always follow me or call us to you can always follow me or call us to you can always follow me or call us to get informed and u thank you so much for get informed and u thank you so much for get informed and u thank you so much for all the help. I think we have a couple all the help. I think we have a couple all the help. I think we have a couple of minutes if we want to have a uh of minutes if we want to have a uh of minutes if we want to have a uh questions. I totally agree with you that you've got I totally agree with you that you've got I totally agree with you that you've got to prioritize your vulnerabilities and to prioritize your vulnerabilities and to prioritize your vulnerabilities and the exploitable ones and the critical the exploitable ones and the critical the exploitable ones and the critical ones. Agree ones. Agree ones. Agree 100%. One issue we've ran into is if our 100%. One issue we've ran into is if our 100%. One issue we've ran into is if our IT teams are only focusing on the IT teams are only focusing on the IT teams are only focusing on the criticals, they tend to ignore the lows, criticals, they tend to ignore the lows, criticals, they tend to ignore the lows, the mediums, and sometimes the highs the mediums, and sometimes the highs the mediums, and sometimes the highs because they're focusing only on because they're focusing only on because they're focusing only on criticals. In your research, have you criticals. In your research, have you criticals. In your research, have you have you ever seen situations where have you ever seen situations where have you ever seen situations where highs get exploited as a highs get exploited as a highs get exploited as a foothold or any even a medium? 100%. foothold or any even a medium? 100%. foothold or any even a medium? 100%. Yes. Yes. Yes. So again, agree on the prioritization. So again, agree on the prioritization. So again, agree on the prioritization. How do we continue that message that How do we continue that message that How do we continue that message that even though criticals and highs are our even though criticals and highs are our even though criticals and highs are our priorities? IT teams should still part priorities? IT teams should still part priorities? IT teams should still part of their business as usual process deal of their business as usual process deal of their business as usual process deal with the non-criticals too because with the non-criticals too because with the non-criticals too because that's one thing that we do have that that's one thing that we do have that that's one thing that we do have that issue where issue where issue where where they only have so many times they where they only have so many times they where they only have so many times they only have so many manhour in the day only have so many manhour in the day only have so many manhour in the day they still need to deal with the non they still need to deal with the non they still need to deal with the non CISAV non CVSS 10.0 that need to be CISAV non CVSS 10.0 that need to be CISAV non CVSS 10.0 that need to be occurred. Let me get to this slide. occurred. Let me get to this slide. occurred. Let me get to this slide. Right. Sorry. Right. Sorry. Right. Sorry. Okay. This is six months ago. If you Okay. This is six months ago. If you Okay. This is six months ago. If you look at top right, it says November 12 look at top right, it says November 12 look at top right, it says November 12 last last last year. These are the advisory and you can year. These are the advisory and you can year. These are the advisory and you can see the logos, right? And these are 42 see the logos, right? And these are 42 see the logos, right? And these are 42 vulnerability that they are stating that vulnerability that they are stating that vulnerability that they are stating that they are seeing active exploitation. they are seeing active exploitation. they are seeing active exploitation. Seesaw do not add anything to their KV Seesaw do not add anything to their KV Seesaw do not add anything to their KV list unless they are convinced that they list unless they are convinced that they list unless they are convinced that they are seeing the active exploitation the are seeing the active exploitation the are seeing the active exploitation the evidence right and they released this evidence right and they released this evidence right and they released this and this was exactly what uh you were and this was exactly what uh you were and this was exactly what uh you were mentioning look at that all these mentioning look at that all these mentioning look at that all these 5.5 you you're telling me that your IT 5.5 you you're telling me that your IT 5.5 you you're telling me that your IT teams are okay this is not good enough teams are okay this is not good enough teams are okay this is not good enough that's why you need to educate them with that's why you need to educate them with that's why you need to educate them with the advanced scoring that you are using. the advanced scoring that you are using. the advanced scoring that you are using. For example, I know uh Dan is a For example, I know uh Dan is a For example, I know uh Dan is a customer. We had a chat earlier customer. We had a chat earlier customer. We had a chat earlier today. You need to tell them that Qualis today. You need to tell them that Qualis today. You need to tell them that Qualis is providing a true risk score. That is providing a true risk score. That is providing a true risk score. That true risk score, it doesn't look at one true risk score, it doesn't look at one true risk score, it doesn't look at one item. It's looking item. It's looking item. It's looking at 10 15 different things and including at 10 15 different things and including at 10 15 different things and including for for for example all of that, right? And example all of that, right? And example all of that, right? And then this data that I'm showing here is then this data that I'm showing here is then this data that I'm showing here is just for the vulnerability. The true just for the vulnerability. The true just for the vulnerability. The true risk score that we have going to risk score that we have going to risk score that we have going to consider how critical is the asset. Is consider how critical is the asset. Is consider how critical is the asset. Is it the asset that you identify as part it the asset that you identify as part it the asset that you identify as part of a finance team or uh taking care of of a finance team or uh taking care of of a finance team or uh taking care of something important. It going to something important. It going to something important. It going to consider all of that. I don't have any consider all of that. I don't have any consider all of that. I don't have any slides for those uh tourist stuff slides for those uh tourist stuff slides for those uh tourist stuff because I didn't want to make it about because I didn't want to make it about because I didn't want to make it about qualies but it will include all of that qualies but it will include all of that qualies but it will include all of that and then it will tell you that your and then it will tell you that your and then it will tell you that your tourist score is 800 and it's red. If tourist score is 800 and it's red. If tourist score is 800 and it's red. If this is bad, you need to quickly do this is bad, you need to quickly do this is bad, you need to quickly do something. And definitely if we can uh something. And definitely if we can uh something. And definitely if we can uh have a ways to uh quickly uh have a have a ways to uh quickly uh have a have a ways to uh quickly uh have a enablement for you and for your team to enablement for you and for your team to enablement for you and for your team to in order to uh educate them. That's a in order to uh educate them. That's a in order to uh educate them. That's a conversation that we should have and we conversation that we should have and we conversation that we should have and we can definitely more than we are more can definitely more than we are more can definitely more than we are more than happy to do that. Uh but uh yes uh than happy to do that. Uh but uh yes uh than happy to do that. Uh but uh yes uh I totally agree. We need to educate them I totally agree. We need to educate them I totally agree. We need to educate them and and and uh give them what they need especially uh give them what they need especially uh give them what they need especially for example in case of remediation right for example in case of remediation right for example in case of remediation right the tourist eliminate that we this is a the tourist eliminate that we this is a the tourist eliminate that we this is a tool that you will not use it the IT tool that you will not use it the IT tool that you will not use it the IT team going to use it because they are team going to use it because they are team going to use it because they are the one that they're going to take care the one that they're going to take care the one that they're going to take care of that and if we can give them the of that and if we can give them the of that and if we can give them the assurance that when you run that script assurance that when you run that script assurance that when you run that script nothing bad going to go go uh that nothing bad going to go go uh that nothing bad going to go go uh that anyway Okay, the the the point is we're anyway Okay, the the the point is we're anyway Okay, the the the point is we're going to tell them that this is already going to tell them that this is already going to tell them that this is already tested and our customer are using it. We tested and our customer are using it. We tested and our customer are using it. We already have a positive idea that this already have a positive idea that this already have a positive idea that this is going to solving your problem and not is going to solving your problem and not is going to solving your problem and not adding more problem to your this list. adding more problem to your this list. adding more problem to your this list. That is why I'm mentioning that you need That is why I'm mentioning that you need That is why I'm mentioning that you need to have a good tools in order to help to have a good tools in order to help to have a good tools in order to help you with that. If it's a patch patch if you with that. If it's a patch patch if you with that. If it's a patch patch if it's not patch remediation or some other it's not patch remediation or some other it's not patch remediation or some other uh ways basically question. Yeah, I was curious um on some question. Yeah, I was curious um on some question. Yeah, I was curious um on some of your slides you showed how fast of your slides you showed how fast of your slides you showed how fast companies were patching like you had companies were patching like you had companies were patching like you had mean meantime to remediation on one mean meantime to remediation on one mean meantime to remediation on one slide showing like 30 and a half days slide showing like 30 and a half days slide showing like 30 and a half days and then you had specific CVE data for and then you had specific CVE data for and then you had specific CVE data for the response time from companies. So I the response time from companies. So I the response time from companies. So I was just curious how you acquired that. was just curious how you acquired that. was just curious how you acquired that. We are a vulnerability management We are a vulnerability management We are a vulnerability management company right and we do have access to company right and we do have access to company right and we do have access to all the assets being detected and how all the assets being detected and how all the assets being detected and how many time being detected and the time many time being detected and the time many time being detected and the time from a first detection last detection from a first detection last detection from a first detection last detection the time that is closed it means that the time that is closed it means that the time that is closed it means that the vulnerability are remediated we uh the vulnerability are remediated we uh the vulnerability are remediated we uh work with our team and they anonymize work with our team and they anonymize work with our team and they anonymize the data and they provide it to us and the data and they provide it to us and the data and they provide it to us and that's the part of 750 million record that's the part of 750 million record that's the part of 750 million record that all these analysis happen basically that all these analysis happen basically that all these analysis happen basically when you have the first time that is when you have the first time that is when you have the first time that is detection happened the last time and the detection happened the last time and the detection happened the last time and the close time then you can conclude that close time then you can conclude that close time then you can conclude that okay this got closed on the same day or okay this got closed on the same day or okay this got closed on the same day or a week and then multiply that 750 time a week and then multiply that 750 time a week and then multiply that 750 time and tie it to all different CVE that way and tie it to all different CVE that way and tie it to all different CVE that way you can plot those to see how that work you can plot those to see how that work you can plot those to see how that work over time across different industries or over time across different industries or over time across different industries or customer awesome this sounds like a good customer awesome this sounds like a good customer awesome this sounds like a good place to uh stop let's give a round of place to uh stop let's give a round of place to uh stop let's give a round of applause for say thank you everyone
