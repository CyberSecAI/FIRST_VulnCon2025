Um, as I said, the the title of this Um, as I said, the the title of this Um, as I said, the the title of this talk is where do we aim? The state of talk is where do we aim? The state of talk is where do we aim? The state of vulnerable software identification and vulnerable software identification and vulnerable software identification and its future. Um, I'm Andrew Sudter from its future. Um, I'm Andrew Sudter from its future. Um, I'm Andrew Sudter from BlackBerry's PERT team. Uh, I've been BlackBerry's PERT team. Uh, I've been BlackBerry's PERT team. Uh, I've been with BlackBerry for about 18 years and with BlackBerry for about 18 years and with BlackBerry for about 18 years and in the product security group within in the product security group within in the product security group within PERT uh, specifically for the last 10 PERT uh, specifically for the last 10 PERT uh, specifically for the last 10 years. years. years. Um I participated in the first PERT and Um I participated in the first PERT and Um I participated in the first PERT and CVSSIGs CVSSIGs CVSSIGs uh and previously participated also with uh and previously participated also with uh and previously participated also with AutoISAC and IICazzi before they rolled AutoISAC and IICazzi before they rolled AutoISAC and IICazzi before they rolled into uh the first PERT sig. Um, so I've into uh the first PERT sig. Um, so I've into uh the first PERT sig. Um, so I've been working with um the appsac side of been working with um the appsac side of been working with um the appsac side of things both as a a software producer and things both as a a software producer and things both as a a software producer and a consumer in that as with most uh uh a consumer in that as with most uh uh a consumer in that as with most uh uh most products uh there's some open most products uh there's some open most products uh there's some open source software um we'll say uh in most source software um we'll say uh in most source software um we'll say uh in most applications. applications. applications. A couple caveats before we continue. Uh A couple caveats before we continue. Uh A couple caveats before we continue. Uh this presentation is my own views, not this presentation is my own views, not this presentation is my own views, not necessarily uh Blackberries or any of necessarily uh Blackberries or any of necessarily uh Blackberries or any of the first SIGs or any other groups I'm a the first SIGs or any other groups I'm a the first SIGs or any other groups I'm a part of like OASP. Um and also a side part of like OASP. Um and also a side part of like OASP. Um and also a side note, I am just getting over a cold. So note, I am just getting over a cold. So note, I am just getting over a cold. So I apologize for any uh throat clearing I apologize for any uh throat clearing I apologize for any uh throat clearing or or sniffling that occurs. I'll I'll or or sniffling that occurs. I'll I'll or or sniffling that occurs. I'll I'll try to get to that mute button. So our agenda uh for today uh button. So our agenda uh for today uh button. So our agenda uh for today uh talk about two of the main software talk about two of the main software talk about two of the main software identification schemes. I know there are identification schemes. I know there are identification schemes. I know there are more than that. Um we'll we'll get to more than that. Um we'll we'll get to more than that. Um we'll we'll get to why I only picked those two. Um the most why I only picked those two. Um the most why I only picked those two. Um the most well-known vulnerment initiatives and well-known vulnerment initiatives and well-known vulnerment initiatives and then discuss a little bit about software then discuss a little bit about software then discuss a little bit about software producers as being the authoritative producers as being the authoritative producers as being the authoritative source of information which I think uh source of information which I think uh source of information which I think uh most people attending here today most people attending here today most people attending here today probably uh hold that view. Uh and then probably uh hold that view. Uh and then probably uh hold that view. Uh and then how MITER and NIST can can play a role how MITER and NIST can can play a role how MITER and NIST can can play a role in pushing us forward to better identify in pushing us forward to better identify in pushing us forward to better identify vulnerable software and map those vulnerable software and map those vulnerable software and map those vulnerabilities. So the two main uh schemes that I want So the two main uh schemes that I want So the two main uh schemes that I want to talk about are CPE and Pearl. Um CPE to talk about are CPE and Pearl. Um CPE to talk about are CPE and Pearl. Um CPE is kind of the the grandfather. It's is kind of the the grandfather. It's is kind of the the grandfather. It's been around for quite a while. It's seen been around for quite a while. It's seen been around for quite a while. It's seen some level of adoption particularly in some level of adoption particularly in some level of adoption particularly in full enrichment programs. Uh it works full enrichment programs. Uh it works full enrichment programs. Uh it works well when you have a vendor and a well when you have a vendor and a well when you have a vendor and a product as your level of granularity. Um product as your level of granularity. Um product as your level of granularity. Um your product inversion. your product inversion. your product inversion. Um there's a dictionary maintained to Um there's a dictionary maintained to Um there's a dictionary maintained to enumerate all the known packages that's enumerate all the known packages that's enumerate all the known packages that's maintained by NVD. Um this is a pro and maintained by NVD. Um this is a pro and maintained by NVD. Um this is a pro and a con actually. Uh the dictionary allows a con actually. Uh the dictionary allows a con actually. Uh the dictionary allows you to go and discover available you to go and discover available you to go and discover available packages um however NIS/NVD is also a packages um however NIS/NVD is also a packages um however NIS/NVD is also a single point of failure. Um for single point of failure. Um for single point of failure. Um for downloading the dictionary which I downloading the dictionary which I downloading the dictionary which I actually had issues with last week when actually had issues with last week when actually had issues with last week when I was trying to access their site they I was trying to access their site they I was trying to access their site they had some issues. Um, additionally, they had some issues. Um, additionally, they had some issues. Um, additionally, they are the single point for updates and are the single point for updates and are the single point for updates and those are currently being handled over those are currently being handled over those are currently being handled over email. Um, CPE does have support for email. Um, CPE does have support for email. Um, CPE does have support for version ranges, which is helpful. So, we version ranges, which is helpful. So, we version ranges, which is helpful. So, we don't have a list of, you know, 20, 30, don't have a list of, you know, 20, 30, don't have a list of, you know, 20, 30, 40, 50 CVE going back for all time um, 40, 50 CVE going back for all time um, 40, 50 CVE going back for all time um, from a specific from a specific from a specific version. Um, but it's not great at version. Um, but it's not great at version. Um, but it's not great at identifying things like distribution identifying things like distribution identifying things like distribution points or uh simply at this point being points or uh simply at this point being points or uh simply at this point being accurate. Um, there's obviously some accurate. Um, there's obviously some accurate. Um, there's obviously some things missing due to the way it's being things missing due to the way it's being things missing due to the way it's being maintained uh and the difficulty in maintained uh and the difficulty in maintained uh and the difficulty in getting things updated getting things updated getting things updated there. Uh, Pearl on the other hand is there. Uh, Pearl on the other hand is there. Uh, Pearl on the other hand is decentralized for the most part. Um decentralized for the most part. Um decentralized for the most part. Um there is obviously a a group that's there is obviously a a group that's there is obviously a a group that's maintaining the standard but in terms of maintaining the standard but in terms of maintaining the standard but in terms of what uh what packages are available what uh what packages are available what uh what packages are available there is no central repository for there is no central repository for there is no central repository for those. It is built with the distribution those. It is built with the distribution those. It is built with the distribution points in mind. It's very helpful for points in mind. It's very helpful for points in mind. It's very helpful for situations like uh a Linux um situations like uh a Linux um situations like uh a Linux um uh Linux uh maintainer who's rebundling uh Linux uh maintainer who's rebundling uh Linux uh maintainer who's rebundling something like Pearl or OpenSSL. something like Pearl or OpenSSL. something like Pearl or OpenSSL. uh they might be maintaining one of uh they might be maintaining one of uh they might be maintaining one of those versions long term applying those versions long term applying those versions long term applying patches to it. So the upstream's um list patches to it. So the upstream's um list patches to it. So the upstream's um list of packages that are impacted may not be of packages that are impacted may not be of packages that are impacted may not be the same as the downstream the same as the downstream the same as the downstream redistributor. Uh it works well for redistributor. Uh it works well for redistributor. Uh it works well for libraries in that case as opposed to libraries in that case as opposed to libraries in that case as opposed to uh full products that may be closed uh full products that may be closed uh full products that may be closed source. um libraries that are source. um libraries that are source. um libraries that are distributed through places like GitHub, distributed through places like GitHub, distributed through places like GitHub, GitLab, uh Maven, those sorts of things GitLab, uh Maven, those sorts of things GitLab, uh Maven, those sorts of things uh are where it really shines and allows uh are where it really shines and allows uh are where it really shines and allows us to distinguish between all those us to distinguish between all those us to distinguish between all those different points. Unfortunately, it has different points. Unfortunately, it has different points. Unfortunately, it has seen rather low adoption. Um when I did seen rather low adoption. Um when I did seen rather low adoption. Um when I did a search of the CDE database for a search of the CDE database for a search of the CDE database for mentions of pearls, I found two um ever. mentions of pearls, I found two um ever. mentions of pearls, I found two um ever. Uh so the uptake on it hasn't been great Uh so the uptake on it hasn't been great Uh so the uptake on it hasn't been great so far. doesn't mean I'm saying that's a so far. doesn't mean I'm saying that's a so far. doesn't mean I'm saying that's a a bad thing. I'm not here to advocate a bad thing. I'm not here to advocate a bad thing. I'm not here to advocate for one of these or the other. Um, it for one of these or the other. Um, it for one of these or the other. Um, it does generally assume adoption of a does generally assume adoption of a does generally assume adoption of a package repository of some kind. They do package repository of some kind. They do package repository of some kind. They do have a couple package types uh that help have a couple package types uh that help have a couple package types uh that help mitigate this. There's SWID if you're mitigate this. There's SWID if you're mitigate this. There's SWID if you're using SWID tags. Um, and generic, which using SWID tags. Um, and generic, which using SWID tags. Um, and generic, which is also available. Uh, on the note of is also available. Uh, on the note of is also available. Uh, on the note of SWID, I have specifically left it out SWID, I have specifically left it out SWID, I have specifically left it out because I've seen even less uptake and because I've seen even less uptake and because I've seen even less uptake and discussion around that. It may just be discussion around that. It may just be discussion around that. It may just be the part of the industry that I'm in. the part of the industry that I'm in. the part of the industry that I'm in. Um, but SWID is kind of Um, but SWID is kind of Um, but SWID is kind of a third runner in this race right a third runner in this race right a third runner in this race right now. Um, there is also potential for the now. Um, there is also potential for the now. Um, there is also potential for the list of impacted Pearl uh URLs to list of impacted Pearl uh URLs to list of impacted Pearl uh URLs to absolutely explode when we take into absolutely explode when we take into absolutely explode when we take into account a package that's very popular account a package that's very popular account a package that's very popular like OpenSSL or Pearl. We might see the like OpenSSL or Pearl. We might see the like OpenSSL or Pearl. We might see the upstream. Then we might see uh Red Hat, upstream. Then we might see uh Red Hat, upstream. Then we might see uh Red Hat, Debian, um Alpine Linux, um anywhere Debian, um Alpine Linux, um anywhere Debian, um Alpine Linux, um anywhere that gets redistributed that might have that gets redistributed that might have that gets redistributed that might have different different different information, backporting patches, things information, backporting patches, things information, backporting patches, things like that. That list of pearls can get like that. That list of pearls can get like that. That list of pearls can get really, really big. Pearl does also have really, really big. Pearl does also have really, really big. Pearl does also have some support for version ranges. Uh but some support for version ranges. Uh but some support for version ranges. Uh but I'm not aware of any support for being I'm not aware of any support for being I'm not aware of any support for being able to say um a range of package able to say um a range of package able to say um a range of package locations where it could be. Uh so locations where it could be. Uh so locations where it could be. Uh so that's still one area where it could that's still one area where it could that's still one area where it could potentially potentially potentially explode. Both of them have some similar explode. Both of them have some similar explode. Both of them have some similar problems. There is a lack of accurate problems. There is a lack of accurate problems. There is a lack of accurate data in the wild. Uh which we'll get to data in the wild. Uh which we'll get to data in the wild. Uh which we'll get to in a few more slides in a little more in a few more slides in a little more in a few more slides in a little more detail. Both are still useful. Both have detail. Both are still useful. Both have detail. Both are still useful. Both have different advantages. Um as I said, I'm different advantages. Um as I said, I'm different advantages. Um as I said, I'm not advocating for one of these over the not advocating for one of these over the not advocating for one of these over the other. They're both perfectly other. They're both perfectly other. They're both perfectly serviceable and they work well for what serviceable and they work well for what serviceable and they work well for what they were intended to do, which is not they were intended to do, which is not they were intended to do, which is not necessarily the same thing. So for the vulner enrichment programs um So for the vulner enrichment programs um So for the vulner enrichment programs um we'll talk about we'll talk about we'll talk about two. The main one that uh everybody two. The main one that uh everybody two. The main one that uh everybody knows and everybody's been talking about knows and everybody's been talking about knows and everybody's been talking about for years including Volcon last year and for years including Volcon last year and for years including Volcon last year and I'm sure Volcon this year as well uh is I'm sure Volcon this year as well uh is I'm sure Volcon this year as well uh is the program uh run by NIST through the program uh run by NIST through the program uh run by NIST through NVD. Um there are some issues with it. NVD. Um there are some issues with it. NVD. Um there are some issues with it. The backlog is continuing to grow. Uh The backlog is continuing to grow. Uh The backlog is continuing to grow. Uh NIS released a statement just a little NIS released a statement just a little NIS released a statement just a little while ago. um they saw uh 32% increase while ago. um they saw uh 32% increase while ago. um they saw uh 32% increase in CDE submissions for 2025 so far. Um in CDE submissions for 2025 so far. Um in CDE submissions for 2025 so far. Um which means that being able to keep up which means that being able to keep up which means that being able to keep up with the 2024 rate, which is where with the 2024 rate, which is where with the 2024 rate, which is where they're at, uh they're not able to keep they're at, uh they're not able to keep they're at, uh they're not able to keep up with that extra 32% growth. Um so up with that extra 32% growth. Um so up with that extra 32% growth. Um so this continuous growth makes it very this continuous growth makes it very this continuous growth makes it very hard for them to scale. Um the program hard for them to scale. Um the program hard for them to scale. Um the program is potentially going to be impacted by is potentially going to be impacted by is potentially going to be impacted by ongoing reductions. Um you never know ongoing reductions. Um you never know ongoing reductions. Um you never know what's going to happen there. what's going to happen there. what's going to happen there. Disputes regarding CVSS scores are Disputes regarding CVSS scores are Disputes regarding CVSS scores are fairly common. Um will go rescore things fairly common. Um will go rescore things fairly common. Um will go rescore things uh which has led to a lot of push back uh which has led to a lot of push back uh which has led to a lot of push back from library maintainers. Uh there's a from library maintainers. Uh there's a from library maintainers. Uh there's a specific example there. Uh the curl specific example there. Uh the curl specific example there. Uh the curl project has been very vocal in their project has been very vocal in their project has been very vocal in their criticism of NVD scoring. criticism of NVD scoring. criticism of NVD scoring. Um they have started to include data Um they have started to include data Um they have started to include data from the CISA ADP which is an excellent from the CISA ADP which is an excellent from the CISA ADP which is an excellent enrichment program we'll talk about. Um, enrichment program we'll talk about. Um, enrichment program we'll talk about. Um, however, they're not including all of however, they're not including all of however, they're not including all of the CNA provided data. Um, I've started the CNA provided data. Um, I've started the CNA provided data. Um, I've started to see some of that pop up, so maybe to see some of that pop up, so maybe to see some of that pop up, so maybe that's changing. Um, but most of the that's changing. Um, but most of the that's changing. Um, but most of the data there is generated by NVD or data there is generated by NVD or data there is generated by NVD or CISA. Uh, which has varying levels of CISA. Uh, which has varying levels of CISA. Uh, which has varying levels of accuracy because they are a third party accuracy because they are a third party accuracy because they are a third party here. On to CISA. Um, CISA is currently here. On to CISA. Um, CISA is currently here. On to CISA. Um, CISA is currently the only authorized data publisher for the only authorized data publisher for the only authorized data publisher for the CVE program. um they're the initial the CVE program. um they're the initial the CVE program. um they're the initial one brought in. They have a specific one brought in. They have a specific one brought in. They have a specific scope that they have set uh in terms of scope that they have set uh in terms of scope that they have set uh in terms of which records they will enrich. Um those which records they will enrich. Um those which records they will enrich. Um those um need to score at least one of a um need to score at least one of a um need to score at least one of a technical impact of total automatable technical impact of total automatable technical impact of total automatable yes exploitation has to be proof of yes exploitation has to be proof of yes exploitation has to be proof of concept or active. uh and if any one of concept or active. uh and if any one of concept or active. uh and if any one of those are met um and it is lacking CDSS, those are met um and it is lacking CDSS, those are met um and it is lacking CDSS, CWE or CPE data, the CISAP program takes CWE or CPE data, the CISAP program takes CWE or CPE data, the CISAP program takes it into scope to add the missing data. it into scope to add the missing data. it into scope to add the missing data. However, as of December 10th, 2024, uh However, as of December 10th, 2024, uh However, as of December 10th, 2024, uh CISA has stated that they will no longer CISA has stated that they will no longer CISA has stated that they will no longer be providing CPE be providing CPE be providing CPE data, which is the particular interest data, which is the particular interest data, which is the particular interest here. um because that's how we identify here. um because that's how we identify here. um because that's how we identify which uh products or applications or which uh products or applications or which uh products or applications or libraries are impacted by a particular libraries are impacted by a particular libraries are impacted by a particular vulnerability. So this is very important vulnerability. So this is very important vulnerability. So this is very important data for us but it's not going to be data for us but it's not going to be data for us but it's not going to be added any added any added any longer. Uh CISA does defer to the CNAs longer. Uh CISA does defer to the CNAs longer. Uh CISA does defer to the CNAs um both before and after the CISA data um both before and after the CISA data um both before and after the CISA data is added. So if the CNA provides data is added. So if the CNA provides data is added. So if the CNA provides data upfront, CISA is not going to overwrite upfront, CISA is not going to overwrite upfront, CISA is not going to overwrite it. If you provided a CBSS score but not it. If you provided a CBSS score but not it. If you provided a CBSS score but not CWE or CPE, they will only add the CWE CWE or CPE, they will only add the CWE CWE or CPE, they will only add the CWE or CPE uh no longer or CPE uh no longer or CPE uh no longer CPE. And if you come back later and add CPE. And if you come back later and add CPE. And if you come back later and add that data, uh let's say you add your own that data, uh let's say you add your own that data, uh let's say you add your own CWE a week later, CISA will remove their CWE a week later, CISA will remove their CWE a week later, CISA will remove their data. So the CNA is being seen as the data. So the CNA is being seen as the data. So the CNA is being seen as the authority on what's the vulnerability is authority on what's the vulnerability is authority on what's the vulnerability is what's the scope how is the product what's the scope how is the product what's the scope how is the product impacted and I think we can all impacted and I think we can all impacted and I think we can all hopefully agree um as the software hopefully agree um as the software hopefully agree um as the software producer if you are also the CNA which producer if you are also the CNA which producer if you are also the CNA which you should be um you probably know your you should be um you probably know your you should be um you probably know your product best and can make the best product best and can make the best product best and can make the best assessments. Um this kind of gets around assessments. Um this kind of gets around assessments. Um this kind of gets around a little bit of the push back we see a little bit of the push back we see a little bit of the push back we see with NVD where things are being rescored with NVD where things are being rescored with NVD where things are being rescored um from an outside perspective and may um from an outside perspective and may um from an outside perspective and may not have all the information. Um CISA not have all the information. Um CISA not have all the information. Um CISA defers to the CNA which I really like to defers to the CNA which I really like to defers to the CNA which I really like to see. Now with CISA ending its see. Now with CISA ending its see. Now with CISA ending its contribution of CPE data, I wanted to contribution of CPE data, I wanted to contribution of CPE data, I wanted to have a look and understand how much CP have a look and understand how much CP have a look and understand how much CP data is really there to begin with and data is really there to begin with and data is really there to begin with and what's the impact of CISA uh no longer what's the impact of CISA uh no longer what's the impact of CISA uh no longer providing it. providing it. providing it. So, I took a look back to So, I took a look back to So, I took a look back to 2015, and we see that CPE data 2015, and we see that CPE data 2015, and we see that CPE data uh didn't really start getting uh didn't really start getting uh didn't really start getting contributed until around the 2020 mark. contributed until around the 2020 mark. contributed until around the 2020 mark. Um, and we can see how the number of Um, and we can see how the number of Um, and we can see how the number of CDEs has grown uh year-over-year and the CDEs has grown uh year-over-year and the CDEs has grown uh year-over-year and the increase that um NVD, for example, has increase that um NVD, for example, has increase that um NVD, for example, has had to deal with. And this is a great a had to deal with. And this is a great a had to deal with. And this is a great a great visualization on why they're great visualization on why they're great visualization on why they're struggling to keep up doing all of this struggling to keep up doing all of this struggling to keep up doing all of this by hand. Now, the lower two lines, uh, by hand. Now, the lower two lines, uh, by hand. Now, the lower two lines, uh, the light blue, which is the the middle the light blue, which is the the middle the light blue, which is the the middle line, and the orange, which is the line, and the orange, which is the line, and the orange, which is the bottom. I'm sorry if these aren't, uh, bottom. I'm sorry if these aren't, uh, bottom. I'm sorry if these aren't, uh, colorblind friendly. Um, I didn't think colorblind friendly. Um, I didn't think colorblind friendly. Um, I didn't think of that till later. Um, we can see that of that till later. Um, we can see that of that till later. Um, we can see that CISA is providing most of the CPE data CISA is providing most of the CPE data CISA is providing most of the CPE data that exists in the CVE database. And that exists in the CVE database. And that exists in the CVE database. And this is being pulled just from CVE.org. this is being pulled just from CVE.org. this is being pulled just from CVE.org. This is not being pulled from NVD. This is not being pulled from NVD. This is not being pulled from NVD. Um, but CISA is providing most of the Um, but CISA is providing most of the Um, but CISA is providing most of the data, which is a problem because now data, which is a problem because now data, which is a problem because now that CISA is no longer providing it, um, that CISA is no longer providing it, um, that CISA is no longer providing it, um, I've added dotted lines at the end there I've added dotted lines at the end there I've added dotted lines at the end there to project where things are headed. Um, to project where things are headed. Um, to project where things are headed. Um, the CDE submissions, um, the projection the CDE submissions, um, the projection the CDE submissions, um, the projection there is a modest 15% increase. And for there is a modest 15% increase. And for there is a modest 15% increase. And for the CPE data, um, it's actually a 50% the CPE data, um, it's actually a 50% the CPE data, um, it's actually a 50% increase in what's currently be being increase in what's currently be being increase in what's currently be being provided by the CNAs. and we're still provided by the CNAs. and we're still provided by the CNAs. and we're still seeing that the line is really bottoming seeing that the line is really bottoming seeing that the line is really bottoming out here. Um, this makes it really out here. Um, this makes it really out here. Um, this makes it really really difficult for anybody to go and really difficult for anybody to go and really difficult for anybody to go and get a sbomb from their vendor. Um, which get a sbomb from their vendor. Um, which get a sbomb from their vendor. Um, which you know obviously has been talked about you know obviously has been talked about you know obviously has been talked about in other talks here as well. Um, take in other talks here as well. Um, take in other talks here as well. Um, take that sbomb, correlate it to some that sbomb, correlate it to some that sbomb, correlate it to some vulnerabilities and have an vulnerabilities and have an vulnerabilities and have an understanding of what vulnerabilities understanding of what vulnerabilities understanding of what vulnerabilities might be impacting that particular might be impacting that particular might be impacting that particular product. Um, the CPE data or Pearl data product. Um, the CPE data or Pearl data product. Um, the CPE data or Pearl data is really key to is really key to is really key to that. But we're not going to have the that. But we're not going to have the that. But we're not going to have the data unless somebody provides it. And as data unless somebody provides it. And as data unless somebody provides it. And as we're seeing, CISA has stopped providing we're seeing, CISA has stopped providing we're seeing, CISA has stopped providing it. NVD struggles to keep up. it. NVD struggles to keep up. it. NVD struggles to keep up. So what can we do to try to tackle this problem? The CNAs, which are typically problem? The CNAs, which are typically problem? The CNAs, which are typically the software producer, if you're a the software producer, if you're a the software producer, if you're a software producer and you're not a CNA, software producer and you're not a CNA, software producer and you're not a CNA, I encourage you to go take a look at uh I encourage you to go take a look at uh I encourage you to go take a look at uh becoming one. Um we have unique insight becoming one. Um we have unique insight becoming one. Um we have unique insight into our products and our software. um into our products and our software. um into our products and our software. um particularly with closed source products particularly with closed source products particularly with closed source products uh we have access to the source code for uh we have access to the source code for uh we have access to the source code for our own applications. We can do that our own applications. We can do that our own applications. We can do that deep dive have that good understanding deep dive have that good understanding deep dive have that good understanding of what the vulnerability is and how it of what the vulnerability is and how it of what the vulnerability is and how it works uh that may not be available to works uh that may not be available to works uh that may not be available to somebody on the outside who only somebody on the outside who only somebody on the outside who only receives a binary receives a binary receives a binary version. Um as a result of that we version. Um as a result of that we version. Um as a result of that we should really be the authoritative should really be the authoritative should really be the authoritative source uh and CISA recognizes that in source uh and CISA recognizes that in source uh and CISA recognizes that in their AD ADP program. their AD ADP program. their AD ADP program. However, if we want to be that However, if we want to be that However, if we want to be that authoritative source of what's impacted authoritative source of what's impacted authoritative source of what's impacted and how it's impacted, we need to and how it's impacted, we need to and how it's impacted, we need to actually provide the data. Um, if we actually provide the data. Um, if we actually provide the data. Um, if we don't provide it, somebody else through don't provide it, somebody else through don't provide it, somebody else through a vulnerrichment program may come along a vulnerrichment program may come along a vulnerrichment program may come along and do it for us and we may not agree and do it for us and we may not agree and do it for us and we may not agree with what they've assessed or the ranges with what they've assessed or the ranges with what they've assessed or the ranges that they've specified. um coming back that they've specified. um coming back that they've specified. um coming back after the fact and saying, "Well, you after the fact and saying, "Well, you after the fact and saying, "Well, you know, this is wrong because of whatever know, this is wrong because of whatever know, this is wrong because of whatever uh information you didn't have, that's uh information you didn't have, that's uh information you didn't have, that's great, but if we didn't provide it, then great, but if we didn't provide it, then great, but if we didn't provide it, then somebody had to try to figure it out." somebody had to try to figure it out." somebody had to try to figure it out." Um we also see that we can't necessarily Um we also see that we can't necessarily Um we also see that we can't necessarily rely on these vulnerrichment programs. rely on these vulnerrichment programs. rely on these vulnerrichment programs. Um depending on funding or priorities, Um depending on funding or priorities, Um depending on funding or priorities, those things may all shift from under us those things may all shift from under us those things may all shift from under us and we might lose that data being added. and we might lose that data being added. and we might lose that data being added. The other thing is there's many many The other thing is there's many many The other thing is there's many many more software producers than enrichment more software producers than enrichment more software producers than enrichment programs. So splitting up the work programs. So splitting up the work programs. So splitting up the work between all of us. We contribute the between all of us. We contribute the between all of us. We contribute the information for our own products. We can information for our own products. We can information for our own products. We can then consume the information for the then consume the information for the then consume the information for the products that we consume. As long as products that we consume. As long as products that we consume. As long as everybody is providing it, everybody everybody is providing it, everybody everybody is providing it, everybody gets that data back out again and we can gets that data back out again and we can gets that data back out again and we can all have good coverage. all have good coverage. all have good coverage. This is going to be necessary for us to This is going to be necessary for us to This is going to be necessary for us to to really scale the use of sbombs for to really scale the use of sbombs for to really scale the use of sbombs for tracking vulnerabilities in our systems. tracking vulnerabilities in our systems. tracking vulnerabilities in our systems. Um, if we have to go and manually Um, if we have to go and manually Um, if we have to go and manually correlate these things, um, that just correlate these things, um, that just correlate these things, um, that just takes more people and people takes more people and people takes more people and people unfortunately are not the most scalable unfortunately are not the most scalable unfortunately are not the most scalable resource we have. So where can MITER, CISA, and NVD have. So where can MITER, CISA, and NVD have. So where can MITER, CISA, and NVD all still fit into this? Um, all still fit into this? Um, all still fit into this? Um, I I may sound like I've done a little I I may sound like I've done a little I I may sound like I've done a little bit of bashing on on CISA and NVD um but bit of bashing on on CISA and NVD um but bit of bashing on on CISA and NVD um but they do provide a valuable service to us they do provide a valuable service to us they do provide a valuable service to us today. today. today. Um MITER does provide recognition to Um MITER does provide recognition to Um MITER does provide recognition to CNAs that perform some level of CNAs that perform some level of CNAs that perform some level of enrichment. Um currently this includes enrichment. Um currently this includes enrichment. Um currently this includes the affected the affected the affected data which is not necessarily CPE or data which is not necessarily CPE or data which is not necessarily CPE or Pearl. Um, the affected data has several Pearl. Um, the affected data has several Pearl. Um, the affected data has several different formats, including a very different formats, including a very different formats, including a very human readable format, which is great if human readable format, which is great if human readable format, which is great if I want to go look up a CVE and have an I want to go look up a CVE and have an I want to go look up a CVE and have an understanding quickly of the vulnerable understanding quickly of the vulnerable understanding quickly of the vulnerable ranges. That's very helpful. Um, ranges. That's very helpful. Um, ranges. That's very helpful. Um, however, the recognition doesn't extend however, the recognition doesn't extend however, the recognition doesn't extend to say specifically that you should be to say specifically that you should be to say specifically that you should be providing a machine readable affected providing a machine readable affected providing a machine readable affected set of data. set of data. set of data. um adjusting this so that the um adjusting this so that the um adjusting this so that the recognition uh includes that will help recognition uh includes that will help recognition uh includes that will help encourage CNAs to provide the data so encourage CNAs to provide the data so encourage CNAs to provide the data so they can appear on the um the the list they can appear on the um the the list they can appear on the um the the list with a gold star. Um eventually, you with a gold star. Um eventually, you with a gold star. Um eventually, you know, after a period of time of know, after a period of time of know, after a period of time of encouraging the behavior, uh it would be encouraging the behavior, uh it would be encouraging the behavior, uh it would be great to see that information actually great to see that information actually great to see that information actually become mandatory when submitting a CVE. become mandatory when submitting a CVE. become mandatory when submitting a CVE. uh CISA and NVD uh can still help to uh CISA and NVD uh can still help to uh CISA and NVD uh can still help to fill in gaps uh for high priority CDEES. fill in gaps uh for high priority CDEES. fill in gaps uh for high priority CDEES. Um CISA does a lot of work with their uh Um CISA does a lot of work with their uh Um CISA does a lot of work with their uh Kev list um looking at those things that Kev list um looking at those things that Kev list um looking at those things that are actively being exploited and are are actively being exploited and are are actively being exploited and are urgent. You know, there's a lot of extra urgent. You know, there's a lot of extra urgent. You know, there's a lot of extra information that CISA and NVD would be information that CISA and NVD would be information that CISA and NVD would be able to provide without necessarily able to provide without necessarily able to provide without necessarily producing the CPE data for us which we producing the CPE data for us which we producing the CPE data for us which we should be providing should be providing should be providing ourselves. Um, NVD specifically, um, it ourselves. Um, NVD specifically, um, it ourselves. Um, NVD specifically, um, it would be great to see some delegation of would be great to see some delegation of would be great to see some delegation of the CPE dictionary to help spread out the CPE dictionary to help spread out the CPE dictionary to help spread out the maintenance. Um, according to the the maintenance. Um, according to the the maintenance. Um, according to the NVD, they have added thousands of CPE NVD, they have added thousands of CPE NVD, they have added thousands of CPE entries per month. And they're receiving entries per month. And they're receiving entries per month. And they're receiving all of those updates over email. Um, I'm all of those updates over email. Um, I'm all of those updates over email. Um, I'm not even aware of a form. Here's the not even aware of a form. Here's the not even aware of a form. Here's the email address and send us an email for email address and send us an email for email address and send us an email for changes or additions to the database. um changes or additions to the database. um changes or additions to the database. um you know moving that into a form uh you know moving that into a form uh you know moving that into a form uh similar to how we work with the CDE similar to how we work with the CDE similar to how we work with the CDE database today um most people probably database today um most people probably database today um most people probably use use use vulneroggram um and delegating the scope vulneroggram um and delegating the scope vulneroggram um and delegating the scope uh also similar to the CNA program um if uh also similar to the CNA program um if uh also similar to the CNA program um if I'm a CNA my scope covers Blackberry's I'm a CNA my scope covers Blackberry's I'm a CNA my scope covers Blackberry's products um it would be great if I could products um it would be great if I could products um it would be great if I could make those updates to the CPE dictionary make those updates to the CPE dictionary make those updates to the CPE dictionary myself uh and remove that burden from myself uh and remove that burden from myself uh and remove that burden from the NVD Sorry. Uh so just final thoughts. Um you Sorry. Uh so just final thoughts. Um you Sorry. Uh so just final thoughts. Um you know we need to spread the work, let know we need to spread the work, let know we need to spread the work, let everybody contribute, but that's going everybody contribute, but that's going everybody contribute, but that's going to require delegation. uh it's going to to require delegation. uh it's going to to require delegation. uh it's going to require cooperation and for all of us to require cooperation and for all of us to require cooperation and for all of us to start producing that data and start producing that data and start producing that data and contributing it to the CVEEs that we're contributing it to the CVEEs that we're contributing it to the CVEEs that we're issuing. Um if we want to be seen as issuing. Um if we want to be seen as issuing. Um if we want to be seen as that authoritative source of that authoritative source of that authoritative source of information, we have to be the ones to information, we have to be the ones to information, we have to be the ones to provide it up front. Um as I said, if we provide it up front. Um as I said, if we provide it up front. Um as I said, if we don't do it, somebody else will and don't do it, somebody else will and don't do it, somebody else will and we're probably not going to like what we're probably not going to like what we're probably not going to like what they come up with. Um, so this is a bit they come up with. Um, so this is a bit they come up with. Um, so this is a bit of a a call to action for everybody um of a a call to action for everybody um of a a call to action for everybody um to start adding that information to your to start adding that information to your to start adding that information to your CVEEs and uh for some of these vulnerab CVEEs and uh for some of these vulnerab CVEEs and uh for some of these vulnerab programs to take a hard look at what programs to take a hard look at what programs to take a hard look at what they're doing and where all of the they're doing and where all of the they're doing and where all of the software producers may be able to software producers may be able to software producers may be able to actually help with the program. Yeah. Uh so I managed to get program. Yeah. Uh so I managed to get program. Yeah. Uh so I managed to get through that uh fairly quick. Um but through that uh fairly quick. Um but through that uh fairly quick. Um but they did say we can go for another 10 they did say we can go for another 10 they did say we can go for another 10 minutes. So I can open it up for minutes. So I can open it up for minutes. So I can open it up for questions and uh comments that people questions and uh comments that people questions and uh comments that people might have. Yeah, sure. We'll go ahead and uh ask a Yeah, sure. We'll go ahead and uh ask a Yeah, sure. We'll go ahead and uh ask a question here from from the room. question here from from the room. question here from from the room. Although the the applause is Although the the applause is Although the the applause is appreciated. Feel free to applaud at any appreciated. Feel free to applaud at any appreciated. Feel free to applaud at any times. Thank you. We should do applause breaks Thank you. We should do applause breaks Thank you. We should do applause breaks more often. Here you go. Oh, hi for more often. Here you go. Oh, hi for more often. Here you go. Oh, hi for presentation. Um so I have a particular presentation. Um so I have a particular presentation. Um so I have a particular question which is you mentioned that question which is you mentioned that question which is you mentioned that software producers should be their own software producers should be their own software producers should be their own CNAs. Do you believe that we have the CNAs. Do you believe that we have the CNAs. Do you believe that we have the infrastructure in place to accommodate infrastructure in place to accommodate infrastructure in place to accommodate for for example should tomorrow all the for for example should tomorrow all the for for example should tomorrow all the software projects decide to become their software projects decide to become their software projects decide to become their own CNAs wouldn't we see a similar own CNAs wouldn't we see a similar own CNAs wouldn't we see a similar bottleneck in trying to make it happen bottleneck in trying to make it happen bottleneck in trying to make it happen we might see a bottleneck in onboarding we might see a bottleneck in onboarding we might see a bottleneck in onboarding the producers to become CNAs um the producers to become CNAs um the producers to become CNAs um absolutely once they become a CNA though absolutely once they become a CNA though absolutely once they become a CNA though there's really not much of a bottleneck there's really not much of a bottleneck there's really not much of a bottleneck um we're now submitting our CDEs to an um we're now submitting our CDEs to an um we're now submitting our CDEs to an API from API from API from cde.org. We're no longer relying on cde.org. We're no longer relying on cde.org. We're no longer relying on sending an email to MITER uh with the sending an email to MITER uh with the sending an email to MITER uh with the details, having a back and forth. details, having a back and forth. details, having a back and forth. Somebody has to copy and paste it. Um Somebody has to copy and paste it. Um Somebody has to copy and paste it. Um the CNA is able to go do all that sort the CNA is able to go do all that sort the CNA is able to go do all that sort of thing directly through a tool such as of thing directly through a tool such as of thing directly through a tool such as vulneroggram vulneroggram vulneroggram um and get those things published very um and get those things published very um and get those things published very quickly which will remove that uh the quickly which will remove that uh the quickly which will remove that uh the bottleneck on publishing that bottleneck on publishing that bottleneck on publishing that information. information. information. Right. Thank you. Okay. And we have a Right. Thank you. Okay. And we have a Right. Thank you. Okay. And we have a question that was uh submitted on question that was uh submitted on question that was uh submitted on Discord from uh Girish from Splunk. The Discord from uh Girish from Splunk. The Discord from uh Girish from Splunk. The question is how do we ensure that question is how do we ensure that question is how do we ensure that software producers provide accurate and software producers provide accurate and software producers provide accurate and complete information? Uh well that's a little bit of a a trust Uh well that's a little bit of a a trust Uh well that's a little bit of a a trust thing. Um we have that trust today. um thing. Um we have that trust today. um thing. Um we have that trust today. um that the producer when they publish that the producer when they publish that the producer when they publish their advisory whether they're providing their advisory whether they're providing their advisory whether they're providing the information in machine readable the information in machine readable the information in machine readable format or not uh whether it's accurate format or not uh whether it's accurate format or not uh whether it's accurate or not or not or not um if there is evidence that it's not um if there is evidence that it's not um if there is evidence that it's not accurate I would encourage anybody to accurate I would encourage anybody to accurate I would encourage anybody to reach out to that particular producer reach out to that particular producer reach out to that particular producer and call them out on it. Um certainly if and call them out on it. Um certainly if and call them out on it. Um certainly if I made a mistake in an advisory that I made a mistake in an advisory that I made a mistake in an advisory that BlackBerry has published I'd want BlackBerry has published I'd want BlackBerry has published I'd want somebody to reach out and let me know so somebody to reach out and let me know so somebody to reach out and let me know so we can update it. Um, but there's always we can update it. Um, but there's always we can update it. Um, but there's always going to be a certain level of trust going to be a certain level of trust going to be a certain level of trust required that what's being published is required that what's being published is required that what's being published is actually accurate. Um, unfortunately, actually accurate. Um, unfortunately, actually accurate. Um, unfortunately, um, I know we say with open source, many um, I know we say with open source, many um, I know we say with open source, many eyes will find all the bugs, and I'm eyes will find all the bugs, and I'm eyes will find all the bugs, and I'm sure eventually it will. Um, however, sure eventually it will. Um, however, sure eventually it will. Um, however, there's nobody scouring every single CDE there's nobody scouring every single CDE there's nobody scouring every single CDE being published, reverse engineering it, being published, reverse engineering it, being published, reverse engineering it, and determining that what's being said and determining that what's being said and determining that what's being said is 100% accurate. It's just not is 100% accurate. It's just not is 100% accurate. It's just not something that I think is feasible. Yeah. Um, hello. Thank you from uh for Yeah. Um, hello. Thank you from uh for Yeah. Um, hello. Thank you from uh for your talk. I very much appreciate it your talk. I very much appreciate it your talk. I very much appreciate it also as a vendor CNA. Um my question also as a vendor CNA. Um my question also as a vendor CNA. Um my question would be uh you talked about CPE and would be uh you talked about CPE and would be uh you talked about CPE and Pearl. Um also BlackBerry from uh what I Pearl. Um also BlackBerry from uh what I Pearl. Um also BlackBerry from uh what I know does not have kind of pearls or uh know does not have kind of pearls or uh know does not have kind of pearls or uh that is there anything that you do that is there anything that you do that is there anything that you do internally to identify and map the internally to identify and map the internally to identify and map the components that you actually know what components that you actually know what components that you actually know what you're talking about uh as a component you're talking about uh as a component you're talking about uh as a component in the products that you're uh in the products that you're uh in the products that you're uh analyzing. analyzing. analyzing. Uh yeah. So internally, uh we use some Uh yeah. So internally, uh we use some Uh yeah. So internally, uh we use some vulnerability scanners, um the software vulnerability scanners, um the software vulnerability scanners, um the software composition analysis tools to determine composition analysis tools to determine composition analysis tools to determine what makes up those products. what makes up those products. what makes up those products. Um those are great. Um they're all, you Um those are great. Um they're all, you Um those are great. Um they're all, you know, paid services that we're using to know, paid services that we're using to know, paid services that we're using to do do do that. Um in terms of what we're we're that. Um in terms of what we're we're that. Um in terms of what we're we're publishing, um you're correct. Uh today publishing, um you're correct. Uh today publishing, um you're correct. Uh today we have not published CPE data to our we have not published CPE data to our we have not published CPE data to our CVEEs. Um, that is something that I CVEEs. Um, that is something that I CVEEs. Um, that is something that I intend to work towards going forward for intend to work towards going forward for intend to work towards going forward for us as well. Um, no, I really can't be up us as well. Um, no, I really can't be up us as well. Um, no, I really can't be up here talking about everybody should be here talking about everybody should be here talking about everybody should be doing this and then say, but we're not doing this and then say, but we're not doing this and then say, but we're not going to. Um, so that's definitely going to. Um, so that's definitely going to. Um, so that's definitely something we'll be starting to add. Sorry, does does that cover the the add. Sorry, does does that cover the the add. Sorry, does does that cover the the question there? Was that good? He got a thumbs up. He's going to good? He got a thumbs up. He's going to good? He got a thumbs up. He's going to hit up on Discord afterwards. I got hit up on Discord afterwards. I got hit up on Discord afterwards. I got another question from another question from another question from Yeah. Hi. Um about the the NVD and the Yeah. Hi. Um about the the NVD and the Yeah. Hi. Um about the the NVD and the uh the CP data. Um so we are Sukunia uh the CP data. Um so we are Sukunia uh the CP data. Um so we are Sukunia research. So we have to heavily rely on research. So we have to heavily rely on research. So we have to heavily rely on the NVD data um for the CPEs not for the the NVD data um for the CPEs not for the the NVD data um for the CPEs not for the vulnerability data but just for the CPEs vulnerability data but just for the CPEs vulnerability data but just for the CPEs because that's our go-to. Um so we found because that's our go-to. Um so we found because that's our go-to. Um so we found out late um lately that you can actually out late um lately that you can actually out late um lately that you can actually do massive uh requests within NVD for CP do massive uh requests within NVD for CP do massive uh requests within NVD for CP creation. It's very easy. creation. It's very easy. creation. It's very easy. Um so um just a tip for for those who Um so um just a tip for for those who Um so um just a tip for for those who are actively doing research and they are actively doing research and they are actively doing research and they they look for ways to just add a lot of they look for ways to just add a lot of they look for ways to just add a lot of CPS into that their catalog that would CPS into that their catalog that would CPS into that their catalog that would really be appreciated I guess by the really be appreciated I guess by the really be appreciated I guess by the community and um so please if people community and um so please if people community and um so please if people want to look into it will be great. want to look into it will be great. want to look into it will be great. Yeah if there's a way to publish the the Yeah if there's a way to publish the the Yeah if there's a way to publish the the data without having to you know write an data without having to you know write an data without having to you know write an email to NVD for everyone you want email to NVD for everyone you want email to NVD for everyone you want added. Um that'd be great if you could added. Um that'd be great if you could added. Um that'd be great if you could share it maybe in the discord. share it maybe in the discord. share it maybe in the discord. Uh hi Andrew. Um first thank you for Uh hi Andrew. Um first thank you for Uh hi Andrew. Um first thank you for this talk. I this topic I don't think this talk. I this topic I don't think this talk. I this topic I don't think it's generally acknowledged how it's generally acknowledged how it's generally acknowledged how important this is and the unspoken part important this is and the unspoken part important this is and the unspoken part is that most of the vendors in our is that most of the vendors in our is that most of the vendors in our exhibitor hall depend on this specific exhibitor hall depend on this specific exhibitor hall depend on this specific thing this specific topic. Um, one of thing this specific topic. Um, one of thing this specific topic. Um, one of the things I ran into when I was really the things I ran into when I was really the things I ran into when I was really working a lot with CPE and Pearl data working a lot with CPE and Pearl data working a lot with CPE and Pearl data was the bad ones do way more harm than was the bad ones do way more harm than was the bad ones do way more harm than good. And I'm I'm wondering if you have good. And I'm I'm wondering if you have good. And I'm I'm wondering if you have any thoughts on like how to implement any thoughts on like how to implement any thoughts on like how to implement some QC like quality control or quality some QC like quality control or quality some QC like quality control or quality standards or or something. And I I don't standards or or something. And I I don't standards or or something. And I I don't want to like this is your job now, want to like this is your job now, want to like this is your job now, Andrew, but um if we could start the Andrew, but um if we could start the Andrew, but um if we could start the conversation there uh and you want to conversation there uh and you want to conversation there uh and you want to lead it, I I'm super supportive. I think lead it, I I'm super supportive. I think lead it, I I'm super supportive. I think that's something that I would like to that's something that I would like to that's something that I would like to see personally and you know if you have see personally and you know if you have see personally and you know if you have any insights I'd love to hear them. any insights I'd love to hear them. any insights I'd love to hear them. Uh yeah um kind of like the the question Uh yeah um kind of like the the question Uh yeah um kind of like the the question earlier there there's certainly an earlier there there's certainly an earlier there there's certainly an amount of trust that has to be put into amount of trust that has to be put into amount of trust that has to be put into whoever is publishing the CPE data whoever is publishing the CPE data whoever is publishing the CPE data whether it's NVD CISA or the software whether it's NVD CISA or the software whether it's NVD CISA or the software producer. um in terms of validating producer. um in terms of validating producer. um in terms of validating whether that data is accurate or not. It whether that data is accurate or not. It whether that data is accurate or not. It could even be as simple as reading uh could even be as simple as reading uh could even be as simple as reading uh the human readable text of their the human readable text of their the human readable text of their advisory uh and comparing that to what advisory uh and comparing that to what advisory uh and comparing that to what they published as CPE data. Maybe it they published as CPE data. Maybe it they published as CPE data. Maybe it does or does not line up. Um another does or does not line up. Um another does or does not line up. Um another part of it may simply come down to part of it may simply come down to part of it may simply come down to educating people on how to produce the educating people on how to produce the educating people on how to produce the data. Um you know, what does a CPE data. Um you know, what does a CPE data. Um you know, what does a CPE version range even look like? Uh what version range even look like? Uh what version range even look like? Uh what does a Pearl version range look like? does a Pearl version range look like? does a Pearl version range look like? What's the correct way to use these What's the correct way to use these What's the correct way to use these things? Um, so some of it may just come things? Um, so some of it may just come things? Um, so some of it may just come down to educating the CNAs and software down to educating the CNAs and software down to educating the CNAs and software producers on what these things are and producers on what these things are and producers on what these things are and how to accurately produce them. Um, how to accurately produce them. Um, how to accurately produce them. Um, yeah, that's definitely a discussion we yeah, that's definitely a discussion we yeah, that's definitely a discussion we should have.
