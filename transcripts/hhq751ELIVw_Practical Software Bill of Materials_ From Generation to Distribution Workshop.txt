Um, we do the Norfolk Tides T-ball team. Um, we do the Norfolk Tides T-ball team. Um, we do have a um, git pod environment that we have a um, git pod environment that we have a um, git pod environment that we encourage you to follow along with. That encourage you to follow along with. That encourage you to follow along with. That is the URL at the bottom. It's a tiny URL.com/sbomb-workshop. We'll also be URL.com/sbomb-workshop. We'll also be URL.com/sbomb-workshop. We'll also be sharing that along the way, but if you sharing that along the way, but if you sharing that along the way, but if you want to follow along step by step, you want to follow along step by step, you want to follow along step by step, you can also do it can also do it can also do it there. So, what are we kind of covering there. So, what are we kind of covering there. So, what are we kind of covering today? Uh, we're going to really kind of today? Uh, we're going to really kind of today? Uh, we're going to really kind of break it down into three sections. I'll break it down into three sections. I'll break it down into three sections. I'll say better sbomb generation. Um that's say better sbomb generation. Um that's say better sbomb generation. Um that's really the key part of this first part really the key part of this first part really the key part of this first part is talking about how do we make better is talking about how do we make better is talking about how do we make better higher I say quality more complete higher I say quality more complete higher I say quality more complete sbombs. I know quality is a a touchy sbombs. I know quality is a a touchy sbombs. I know quality is a a touchy subject when it comes to sbombs. Uh subject when it comes to sbombs. Uh subject when it comes to sbombs. Uh we'll be talking a little bit about we'll be talking a little bit about we'll be talking a little bit about sharing and then how do you get you know sharing and then how do you get you know sharing and then how do you get you know bombs from one place to another and then bombs from one place to another and then bombs from one place to another and then operations once you have it what do you operations once you have it what do you operations once you have it what do you do with it? Um again I think the last do with it? Um again I think the last do with it? Um again I think the last slide with this URL it's not hard to slide with this URL it's not hard to slide with this URL it's not hard to remember. Uh definitely open up a laptop remember. Uh definitely open up a laptop remember. Uh definitely open up a laptop and follow along. Yeah. Um, yeah. Uh, and follow along. Yeah. Um, yeah. Uh, and follow along. Yeah. Um, yeah. Uh, also, uh, if there's any questions while also, uh, if there's any questions while also, uh, if there's any questions while we're kind of doing this, uh, while one we're kind of doing this, uh, while one we're kind of doing this, uh, while one of us is talking, feel free to raise of us is talking, feel free to raise of us is talking, feel free to raise your hand if you're having a trouble your hand if you're having a trouble your hand if you're having a trouble installing something or running a installing something or running a installing something or running a particular command. Um, one of us will particular command. Um, one of us will particular command. Um, one of us will stop by and and help you. And then stop by and and help you. And then stop by and and help you. And then obviously if multiple people all seem to obviously if multiple people all seem to obviously if multiple people all seem to be having an issue, we can kind of take be having an issue, we can kind of take be having an issue, we can kind of take a step back as well. Um but I think a step back as well. Um but I think a step back as well. Um but I think before getting into it do we want to before getting into it do we want to before getting into it do we want to just how many of you all uh by raising just how many of you all uh by raising just how many of you all uh by raising your hands work have done have generated your hands work have done have generated your hands work have done have generated sbombs sbombs sbombs before? All right about half or a little before? All right about half or a little before? All right about half or a little more than half. How about um have shared more than half. How about um have shared more than half. How about um have shared sbombs or uh otherwise distributed sbombs or uh otherwise distributed sbombs or uh otherwise distributed sbombs. Okay. Uh little bit few folks sbombs. Okay. Uh little bit few folks sbombs. Okay. Uh little bit few folks less. And then how many folks are less. And then how many folks are less. And then how many folks are consuming sbombs and actually analyzing consuming sbombs and actually analyzing consuming sbombs and actually analyzing them and using them for Okay, also about them and using them for Okay, also about them and using them for Okay, also about half. Okay, thanks. That helps. So yeah, when we start out by saying So yeah, when we start out by saying So yeah, when we start out by saying better sbomb generation, what we're better sbomb generation, what we're better sbomb generation, what we're talking about is the majority of people talking about is the majority of people talking about is the majority of people who generate sbombs, they pull out their who generate sbombs, they pull out their who generate sbombs, they pull out their favorite tool. Uh couple vendors in the favorite tool. Uh couple vendors in the favorite tool. Uh couple vendors in the in the room have their own, right? But in the room have their own, right? But in the room have their own, right? But ultimately people will run it across a ultimately people will run it across a ultimately people will run it across a codebase. So maybe decompose a binary codebase. So maybe decompose a binary codebase. So maybe decompose a binary and join it an SBOM and they say ship and join it an SBOM and they say ship and join it an SBOM and they say ship it. It's great and they never actually it. It's great and they never actually it. It's great and they never actually look at the contents of it. Uh I was look at the contents of it. Uh I was look at the contents of it. Uh I was telling a joke earlier, but it is a true telling a joke earlier, but it is a true telling a joke earlier, but it is a true story. Uh I got a really terrible sbomb story. Uh I got a really terrible sbomb story. Uh I got a really terrible sbomb back on April 1st where like someone back on April 1st where like someone back on April 1st where like someone literally had insert company name as the literally had insert company name as the literally had insert company name as the vendor and they had the Acme Corporation vendor and they had the Acme Corporation vendor and they had the Acme Corporation software uh software license for it uh software uh software license for it uh software uh software license for it uh as the company licensed product. Um and as the company licensed product. Um and as the company licensed product. Um and I thought it was an input joke. um that I thought it was an input joke. um that I thought it was an input joke. um that is I'd say very common that people is I'd say very common that people is I'd say very common that people generate an ESBOM and they ship it. They generate an ESBOM and they ship it. They generate an ESBOM and they ship it. They never actually look at the contents of never actually look at the contents of never actually look at the contents of it. And so a big part of what we talked it. And so a big part of what we talked it. And so a big part of what we talked about when we were saying better ESPOM about when we were saying better ESPOM about when we were saying better ESPOM generation is like let's fill in those generation is like let's fill in those generation is like let's fill in those missing fields that actually make these missing fields that actually make these missing fields that actually make these things practical beyond just the list of things practical beyond just the list of things practical beyond just the list of components. Um so these small changes components. Um so these small changes components. Um so these small changes really do lead to big improvements in really do lead to big improvements in really do lead to big improvements in the quality of your sbomb. Um, and I I the quality of your sbomb. Um, and I I the quality of your sbomb. Um, and I I really encourage folks to do more than really encourage folks to do more than really encourage folks to do more than just pull out SIFT, Trivy, some other just pull out SIFT, Trivy, some other just pull out SIFT, Trivy, some other tool and uh generate an NSBO and slap it tool and uh generate an NSBO and slap it tool and uh generate an NSBO and slap it on a project and send it on a project and send it on a project and send it out. Um, for this portion, we're going out. Um, for this portion, we're going out. Um, for this portion, we're going to be following the sbomb uh producer to be following the sbomb uh producer to be following the sbomb uh producer life cycle. This is something that came life cycle. This is something that came life cycle. This is something that came out of the system tiger teams. Um, so as out of the system tiger teams. Um, so as out of the system tiger teams. Um, so as we started looking through making we started looking through making we started looking through making reference implementations on how to reference implementations on how to reference implementations on how to generate sbombs, we said, okay, like we generate sbombs, we said, okay, like we generate sbombs, we said, okay, like we started like most people do, you started like most people do, you started like most people do, you generate an SBOM, you look at the generate an SBOM, you look at the generate an SBOM, you look at the contents of it, and you say, gee, it's contents of it, and you say, gee, it's contents of it, and you say, gee, it's missing all this information that we missing all this information that we missing all this information that we really want. Um, so how do we begin to really want. Um, so how do we begin to really want. Um, so how do we begin to populate those additional fields that populate those additional fields that populate those additional fields that we're missing? Um, the first step of we're missing? Um, the first step of we're missing? Um, the first step of that is augmentation. And we look at that is augmentation. And we look at that is augmentation. And we look at that as how do you add the top level that as how do you add the top level that as how do you add the top level metadata to the to the document and to metadata to the to the document and to metadata to the to the document and to your top level component that only you your top level component that only you your top level component that only you as the software producer really know, as the software producer really know, as the software producer really know, right? What is your copyright? What is right? What is your copyright? What is right? What is your copyright? What is the description of the product? Where do the description of the product? Where do the description of the product? Where do you find the documentation links? Uh you find the documentation links? Uh you find the documentation links? Uh what's the license? All of these things what's the license? All of these things what's the license? All of these things typically cannot be gleaned by a ESPOM typically cannot be gleaned by a ESPOM typically cannot be gleaned by a ESPOM generation tool. You as the producer generation tool. You as the producer generation tool. You as the producer need to declare what they are. Um next need to declare what they are. Um next need to declare what they are. Um next up is enrichment. that's adding missing up is enrichment. that's adding missing up is enrichment. that's adding missing metadata to all the components that you metadata to all the components that you metadata to all the components that you have listed, right? And so we talk about have listed, right? And so we talk about have listed, right? And so we talk about NTI minimum elements, you talk about any NTI minimum elements, you talk about any NTI minimum elements, you talk about any other standard. Um, you really want to other standard. Um, you really want to other standard. Um, you really want to see a lot of these missing fields see a lot of these missing fields see a lot of these missing fields populated. How do you go about doing populated. How do you go about doing populated. How do you go about doing that? Once you've created an ESBOM, how that? Once you've created an ESBOM, how that? Once you've created an ESBOM, how do you verify it by schema, overall do you verify it by schema, overall do you verify it by schema, overall completeness, um, but also through completeness, um, but also through completeness, um, but also through addistations and other mechanisms before addistations and other mechanisms before addistations and other mechanisms before you then go on and you sign it, right? you then go on and you sign it, right? you then go on and you sign it, right? You declare like you signed it, I'm You declare like you signed it, I'm You declare like you signed it, I'm declaring it. This is what the release declaring it. This is what the release declaring it. This is what the release deskbomb is by whoever produced it. And deskbomb is by whoever produced it. And deskbomb is by whoever produced it. And then we're not going to cover it in then we're not going to cover it in then we're not going to cover it in this. It could be an entire separate this. It could be an entire separate this. It could be an entire separate presentation, but I'll say document presentation, but I'll say document presentation, but I'll say document linking. Right? We talked about the linking. Right? We talked about the linking. Right? We talked about the dependencies within an sbomb between dependencies within an sbomb between dependencies within an sbomb between different components. Well, let's expand different components. Well, let's expand different components. Well, let's expand that. What does that look like for a that. What does that look like for a that. What does that look like for a higher level uh system where you may higher level uh system where you may higher level uh system where you may have multiple sbombs that represent a have multiple sbombs that represent a have multiple sbombs that represent a system? They can't just be distinctly system? They can't just be distinctly system? They can't just be distinctly separate files. You have to somehow link separate files. You have to somehow link separate files. You have to somehow link them to represent the overall system. them to represent the overall system. them to represent the overall system. Another topic, another Another topic, another Another topic, another day. So we talk about generation, you day. So we talk about generation, you day. So we talk about generation, you know, choose your favorite. In this know, choose your favorite. In this know, choose your favorite. In this case, the example is trivia. case, the example is trivia. case, the example is trivia. Um, right? Choose whatever you want. Um, right? Choose whatever you want. Um, right? Choose whatever you want. Standard options, I'd say favorite tool Standard options, I'd say favorite tool Standard options, I'd say favorite tool doesn't matter. Favorite standard doesn't matter. Favorite standard doesn't matter. Favorite standard doesn't matter. Favorite format doesn't doesn't matter. Favorite format doesn't doesn't matter. Favorite format doesn't matter. Um, choose an SBOM generation of matter. Um, choose an SBOM generation of matter. Um, choose an SBOM generation of any type. Um, you know, I think any type. Um, you know, I think any type. Um, you know, I think preaching to the choir here, but your preaching to the choir here, but your preaching to the choir here, but your favorite tool will vary probably favorite tool will vary probably favorite tool will vary probably depending on what package manager you depending on what package manager you depending on what package manager you use. Uh, you know, if you're doing C, use. Uh, you know, if you're doing C, use. Uh, you know, if you're doing C, C++, like I see runtime security back C++, like I see runtime security back C++, like I see runtime security back here looking at the here looking at the here looking at the phones. phones. phones. Hi. Uh, like I mean that's a great Hi. Uh, like I mean that's a great Hi. Uh, like I mean that's a great example of how to generate really high example of how to generate really high example of how to generate really high quality CC C++ bundles, right? A lot of quality CC C++ bundles, right? A lot of quality CC C++ bundles, right? A lot of these other tools don't do a good job these other tools don't do a good job these other tools don't do a good job with that, right? Choose the appropriate with that, right? Choose the appropriate with that, right? Choose the appropriate tool for what you're doing. So here we ran Trivy. This is doing. So here we ran Trivy. This is doing. So here we ran Trivy. This is for keycloak. Um but you'll see like hey for keycloak. Um but you'll see like hey for keycloak. Um but you'll see like hey there's a whole bunch of stuff that that there's a whole bunch of stuff that that there's a whole bunch of stuff that that in my opinion is missing that's pretty in my opinion is missing that's pretty in my opinion is missing that's pretty valuable right so stuff like author the valuable right so stuff like author the valuable right so stuff like author the supplier repository location right um my supplier repository location right um my supplier repository location right um my company we run a giant fast open source company we run a giant fast open source company we run a giant fast open source scanning system where we need to know scanning system where we need to know scanning system where we need to know where to find the original uh where to find the original uh where to find the original uh repositories for all of the open source repositories for all of the open source repositories for all of the open source components we can do deeper analysis of components we can do deeper analysis of components we can do deeper analysis of them gee it would be great if I don't them gee it would be great if I don't them gee it would be great if I don't have to maintain a database of what that have to maintain a database of what that have to maintain a database of what that Tell me where you got your open source Tell me where you got your open source Tell me where you got your open source components that you passed the law. Uh components that you passed the law. Uh components that you passed the law. Uh again, license, copyright, other things again, license, copyright, other things again, license, copyright, other things that from a legal perspective you want that from a legal perspective you want that from a legal perspective you want to declare. Um I see a number of of to declare. Um I see a number of of to declare. Um I see a number of of sbombs where a company says no assertion sbombs where a company says no assertion sbombs where a company says no assertion on the copyright. Come on. This is your copyright. Come on. This is your copyright. Come on. This is your product. Take credit for it. Right? product. Take credit for it. Right? product. Take credit for it. Right? Those are important things for you to Those are important things for you to Those are important things for you to declare as part of your ESPA. declare as part of your ESPA. declare as part of your ESPA. Um, so really how do we go about Um, so really how do we go about Um, so really how do we go about beginning to add that stuff? That's beginning to add that stuff? That's beginning to add that stuff? That's where augmentation jumps where augmentation jumps where augmentation jumps in. So in our definition, augmentation in. So in our definition, augmentation in. So in our definition, augmentation is really focused on the top level is really focused on the top level is really focused on the top level metadata for the document and the metadata for the document and the metadata for the document and the component. Um, there's a couple component. Um, there's a couple component. Um, there's a couple different ways that you could do this. different ways that you could do this. different ways that you could do this. Ultimately, you want to have it Ultimately, you want to have it Ultimately, you want to have it automated as part of your pipeline, automated as part of your pipeline, automated as part of your pipeline, right? Everything here should be right? Everything here should be right? Everything here should be reproducible. Um, there's two ways that reproducible. Um, there's two ways that reproducible. Um, there's two ways that I've approached this problem. I'd love I've approached this problem. I'd love I've approached this problem. I'd love to hear if others have different ways. to hear if others have different ways. to hear if others have different ways. Uh there's a tool from that's an open Uh there's a tool from that's an open Uh there's a tool from that's an open source tool from interlinks called s um source tool from interlinks called s um source tool from interlinks called s um esbomb azim that does a really good job esbomb azim that does a really good job esbomb azim that does a really good job of allowing you to augment this top of allowing you to augment this top of allowing you to augment this top level metadata be it for spdx or cycldx. level metadata be it for spdx or cycldx. level metadata be it for spdx or cycldx. The way I've historically done it is you The way I've historically done it is you The way I've historically done it is you write out some JSON and use jQ and you write out some JSON and use jQ and you write out some JSON and use jQ and you smash it together. Um I'd love to hear smash it together. Um I'd love to hear smash it together. Um I'd love to hear other ways to approach this but this is other ways to approach this but this is other ways to approach this but this is typically how I've done it. Um, again, typically how I've done it. Um, again, typically how I've done it. Um, again, how do you get this top level metadata how do you get this top level metadata how do you get this top level metadata into your sbomb that um may not into your sbomb that um may not into your sbomb that um may not otherwise exist? So, we're going to otherwise exist? So, we're going to otherwise exist? So, we're going to switch over to our little git pod switch over to our little git pod switch over to our little git pod environment environment environment here. Um, so again, I encourage you to here. Um, so again, I encourage you to here. Um, so again, I encourage you to follow along. You can try all this follow along. You can try all this follow along. You can try all this yourself. Um, this is also all directly yourself. Um, this is also all directly yourself. Um, this is also all directly in a GitHub project here if you just in a GitHub project here if you just in a GitHub project here if you just want to follow along with the the want to follow along with the the want to follow along with the the steps. All right. So in this case, we're steps. All right. So in this case, we're steps. All right. So in this case, we're going to do something on going to do something on going to do something on uh we're going to generate an sbomb for uh we're going to generate an sbomb for uh we're going to generate an sbomb for cubectl cube cuddle. Uh allow me to do cubectl cube cuddle. Uh allow me to do cubectl cube cuddle. Uh allow me to do this. I think is there a way to undo think is there a way to undo think is there a way to undo that? Thank that? Thank that? Thank you. A bunch of Mac users trying to use you. A bunch of Mac users trying to use you. A bunch of Mac users trying to use the Windows computer. So we downloaded it. We generated an So we downloaded it. We generated an So we downloaded it. We generated an SBOM. The generated sbomb misses a whole SBOM. The generated sbomb misses a whole SBOM. The generated sbomb misses a whole bunch of stuff, right? It's got just bunch of stuff, right? It's got just bunch of stuff, right? It's got just a very basic top level metadata, top a very basic top level metadata, top a very basic top level metadata, top level component, and then going through level component, and then going through level component, and then going through the probably 4,000 plus components. So here's kind of the same command that So here's kind of the same command that So here's kind of the same command that we would run. Um we're going to go we would run. Um we're going to go we would run. Um we're going to go through and run espamasm twice. Once to through and run espamasm twice. Once to through and run espamasm twice. Once to edit the top level document data uh edit the top level document data uh edit the top level document data uh metadata and then again to uh update the metadata and then again to uh update the metadata and then again to uh update the top level um component data. In this top level um component data. In this top level um component data. In this case, adding, you know, an author, a case, adding, you know, an author, a case, adding, you know, an author, a supplier, what part of life cycle, supplier, what part of life cycle, supplier, what part of life cycle, right? We often debate what type of right? We often debate what type of right? We often debate what type of sbomb something is. Uh we're giving it a sbomb something is. Uh we're giving it a sbomb something is. Uh we're giving it a repository where you find source code repository where you find source code repository where you find source code and then a license uh along with a a and then a license uh along with a a and then a license uh along with a a path for or a URL for that. Let's go ahead and run this. Let's take a look at that death. Let's Let's take a look at that death. Let's Let's take a look at that death. Let's see what it actually added as part of that. All right. So, it did a couple that. All right. So, it did a couple that. All right. So, it did a couple things here. It generated a new serial things here. It generated a new serial things here. It generated a new serial number. You can debate whether or not number. You can debate whether or not number. You can debate whether or not that was necessary, but it's it's that was necessary, but it's it's that was necessary, but it's it's interesting that it did that. We've interesting that it did that. We've interesting that it did that. We've added a life cycle now so we know what added a life cycle now so we know what added a life cycle now so we know what type of sbomb it type of sbomb it type of sbomb it is. It's added uh itself as an is. It's added uh itself as an is. It's added uh itself as an additional tool. Looks great. it touched additional tool. Looks great. it touched additional tool. Looks great. it touched the sbomb. We now know what tools were the sbomb. We now know what tools were the sbomb. We now know what tools were used to generate this used to generate this used to generate this sbomb. Um, and you can hear Mike rant sbomb. Um, and you can hear Mike rant sbomb. Um, and you can hear Mike rant about knowing that information later on about knowing that information later on about knowing that information later on in the presentation. Uh, and then now in the presentation. Uh, and then now in the presentation. Uh, and then now it's added the author, right? So, it's it's added the author, right? So, it's it's added the author, right? So, it's saying who generated this our workshop saying who generated this our workshop saying who generated this our workshop here. Uh, along with all that supplier here. Uh, along with all that supplier here. Uh, along with all that supplier information. So it's saying you know the information. So it's saying you know the information. So it's saying you know the URL for URL for URL for uh where to find Kubernetes not and then uh where to find Kubernetes not and then uh where to find Kubernetes not and then also um the other you know not only the also um the other you know not only the also um the other you know not only the document author but who's added all document author but who's added all document author but who's added all these components us uh along with the these components us uh along with the these components us uh along with the license and uh external references to license and uh external references to license and uh external references to where you can find the repository. All where you can find the repository. All where you can find the repository. All right, so we've added some useful right, so we've added some useful right, so we've added some useful information here right out of the gate. information here right out of the gate. information here right out of the gate. Pretty simple, easy to add into your Pretty simple, easy to add into your Pretty simple, easy to add into your build pipeline. Um but it really begins build pipeline. Um but it really begins build pipeline. Um but it really begins to expand on what's available for the to expand on what's available for the to expand on what's available for the consumer of your sbomb to make it more consumer of your sbomb to make it more consumer of your sbomb to make it more useful right um myself like again what useful right um myself like again what useful right um myself like again what are the two primary cases we often talk are the two primary cases we often talk are the two primary cases we often talk about security we're at vulnerability about security we're at vulnerability about security we're at vulnerability con right but the other big part of it con right but the other big part of it con right but the other big part of it is licenses is legal um so knowing is licenses is legal um so knowing is licenses is legal um so knowing copyright knowing what licenses are copyright knowing what licenses are copyright knowing what licenses are actually applicable here are super actually applicable here are super actually applicable here are super important so we'll switch back over to important so we'll switch back over to important so we'll switch back over to the slides Um, search it all back over the slides Um, search it all back over the slides Um, search it all back over again. All right. So, just to reiterate, again. All right. So, just to reiterate, again. All right. So, just to reiterate, right, the ESPOM approach that we just right, the ESPOM approach that we just right, the ESPOM approach that we just showed there, we've showed there, we've showed there, we've declared what we want to modify. In this declared what we want to modify. In this declared what we want to modify. In this case, the document. We've added a whole case, the document. We've added a whole case, the document. We've added a whole bunch of of additional metadata uh and bunch of of additional metadata uh and bunch of of additional metadata uh and basically generated a new basically generated a new basically generated a new bomb. Um, and we kind of showed some of bomb. Um, and we kind of showed some of bomb. Um, and we kind of showed some of this already, right? We've added a new this already, right? We've added a new this already, right? We've added a new phase who the author is, the supplier, phase who the author is, the supplier, phase who the author is, the supplier, repository location, and license repository location, and license repository location, and license information. information. information. The other way you can do this um right The other way you can do this um right The other way you can do this um right is through what I what I've historically is through what I what I've historically is through what I what I've historically done and it only really works well for done and it only really works well for done and it only really works well for Cycldx. It's not really use it's not a Cycldx. It's not really use it's not a Cycldx. It's not really use it's not a great approach for for SPDX but generate great approach for for SPDX but generate great approach for for SPDX but generate a static JSON file check it in your a static JSON file check it in your a static JSON file check it in your repository and just use jq to smash the repository and just use jq to smash the repository and just use jq to smash the two together. two together. two together. Um and it's again pretty simple easy Um and it's again pretty simple easy Um and it's again pretty simple easy step you can add into any sort of build step you can add into any sort of build step you can add into any sort of build pipeline to add all this top level pipeline to add all this top level pipeline to add all this top level augmented sbomb data. Um I personally augmented sbomb data. Um I personally augmented sbomb data. Um I personally prefer now the as the sbomb aim approach prefer now the as the sbomb aim approach prefer now the as the sbomb aim approach just because it works great for both just because it works great for both just because it works great for both cycl and spdx. cycl and spdx. cycl and spdx. Um, and really helps, you know, at the Um, and really helps, you know, at the Um, and really helps, you know, at the end of the day, end of the day, end of the day, um, be um, be um, be consistent. If if the formats change consistent. If if the formats change consistent. If if the formats change sometime down the road, you don't have sometime down the road, you don't have sometime down the road, you don't have to worry about, uh, trying to re smash to worry about, uh, trying to re smash to worry about, uh, trying to re smash everything together. Excuse me. Here. All right. So, Here. All right. So, Here. All right. So, enrichment. Um, we talked about updating enrichment. Um, we talked about updating enrichment. Um, we talked about updating all the top level metadata. Gee, like all the top level metadata. Gee, like all the top level metadata. Gee, like that's useful. Now, let's talk about the that's useful. Now, let's talk about the that's useful. Now, let's talk about the individual components. individual components. individual components. Um, most build tools today are not Um, most build tools today are not Um, most build tools today are not throwing in all that extra license, throwing in all that extra license, throwing in all that extra license, documentation, links, all that other documentation, links, all that other documentation, links, all that other stuff for each individual component. How stuff for each individual component. How stuff for each individual component. How do we go about doing do we go about doing do we go about doing that? A lot of that information is, you that? A lot of that information is, you that? A lot of that information is, you know, I'll say mandatory under the NIA know, I'll say mandatory under the NIA know, I'll say mandatory under the NIA minimum elements. Um, but I've yet to minimum elements. Um, but I've yet to minimum elements. Um, but I've yet to see an SBOM generator that actually see an SBOM generator that actually see an SBOM generator that actually introduces it. introduces it. introduces it. Um, I I personally have my company has, Um, I I personally have my company has, Um, I I personally have my company has, you know, contract requirements to meet you know, contract requirements to meet you know, contract requirements to meet NTI minimum elements. Um, and I need to NTI minimum elements. Um, and I need to NTI minimum elements. Um, and I need to have my suppliers give me Sbombs that have my suppliers give me Sbombs that have my suppliers give me Sbombs that meet the minimum elements. How do we do meet the minimum elements. How do we do meet the minimum elements. How do we do this in a way that is cost effective for this in a way that is cost effective for this in a way that is cost effective for small mountain pop software producers? Well, um, Sneak has written producers? Well, um, Sneak has written producers? Well, um, Sneak has written Parlay. Um, it does a shockingly good Parlay. Um, it does a shockingly good Parlay. Um, it does a shockingly good job at this. Um and it will reach out in job at this. Um and it will reach out in job at this. Um and it will reach out in this case to uh ecosystems uh which is this case to uh ecosystems uh which is this case to uh ecosystems uh which is one of a couple different databases out one of a couple different databases out one of a couple different databases out there uh that tries to categorize all there uh that tries to categorize all there uh that tries to categorize all this information for open source this information for open source this information for open source components and it will enrich that components and it will enrich that components and it will enrich that sbomb. We'll go in um and add sbomb. We'll go in um and add sbomb. We'll go in um and add documentation links, licenses, authors, documentation links, licenses, authors, documentation links, licenses, authors, all that kind of stuff. Um, granted we all that kind of stuff. Um, granted we all that kind of stuff. Um, granted we don't really know what the quality of don't really know what the quality of don't really know what the quality of that is, but it will do a really good that is, but it will do a really good that is, but it will do a really good job from my from my experience um along job from my from my experience um along job from my from my experience um along the way there. So, here's just an the way there. So, here's just an the way there. So, here's just an example of a single component on on the example of a single component on on the example of a single component on on the left. You see kind of like what that left. You see kind of like what that left. You see kind of like what that component cyclone DX um looked like to component cyclone DX um looked like to component cyclone DX um looked like to what it became. It added description. It what it became. It added description. It what it became. It added description. It added licenses. add a lot of external added licenses. add a lot of external added licenses. add a lot of external references to for the website, how it's references to for the website, how it's references to for the website, how it's distributed, documentation, uh, and distributed, documentation, uh, and distributed, documentation, uh, and other interesting properties like when other interesting properties like when other interesting properties like when was this project first released, what is was this project first released, what is was this project first released, what is the latest, it's been the latest, it's been the latest, it's been updated. For me as a consumer, this updated. For me as a consumer, this updated. For me as a consumer, this gives me a lot of in additional gives me a lot of in additional gives me a lot of in additional information where I go do that deep information where I go do that deep information where I go do that deep analysis of of an SSO. I can go look at analysis of of an SSO. I can go look at analysis of of an SSO. I can go look at all these individual um, repositories all these individual um, repositories all these individual um, repositories and begin to do deeper scanning and and begin to do deeper scanning and and begin to do deeper scanning and whatnot. So, let's do that. Um, I'm also going to try to make it Um, I'm also going to try to make it Um, I'm also going to try to make it look nice at the same time. So, we're look nice at the same time. So, we're look nice at the same time. So, we're going to run parlay uh tell it to use going to run parlay uh tell it to use going to run parlay uh tell it to use ecosystems. They have a couple other uh ecosystems. They have a couple other uh ecosystems. They have a couple other uh data sets. Um, and then we'll tell to data sets. Um, and then we'll tell to data sets. Um, and then we'll tell to enrich dust bomb and then uh we'll make enrich dust bomb and then uh we'll make enrich dust bomb and then uh we'll make it pretty at the same it pretty at the same it pretty at the same time. All right. So, let's stiff that in right. So, let's stiff that in right. So, let's stiff that in comparison to the already augmented comparison to the already augmented comparison to the already augmented sbomb. So, we're not going to look at sbomb. So, we're not going to look at sbomb. So, we're not going to look at the original generated sbomb. We the original generated sbomb. We the original generated sbomb. We augmented it. We're now going to compare augmented it. We're now going to compare augmented it. We're now going to compare it to uh the nursed one. So, you can kind of see here a lot one. So, you can kind of see here a lot one. So, you can kind of see here a lot of that information. You know, this is of that information. You know, this is of that information. You know, this is choosing a random package on top, but choosing a random package on top, but choosing a random package on top, but it's gone through and added all those it's gone through and added all those it's gone through and added all those external references. external references. external references. Um, and it's release dates. This one may Um, and it's release dates. This one may Um, and it's release dates. This one may have already had have already had have already had uh supplier. Oh, it didn't. uh supplier. Oh, it didn't. uh supplier. Oh, it didn't. Okay. Uh, next one down though, you Okay. Uh, next one down though, you Okay. Uh, next one down though, you know, like server uh starts adding know, like server uh starts adding know, like server uh starts adding things like who the supplier is, the things like who the supplier is, the things like who the supplier is, the name, uh, who the author is, licenses, name, uh, who the author is, licenses, name, uh, who the author is, licenses, additional resources along the way. So additional resources along the way. So additional resources along the way. So again, a lot of additional information again, a lot of additional information again, a lot of additional information that's been injected to that into the that's been injected to that into the that's been injected to that into the ESBOM with a pretty easy step. We went through what makes it go from like That's a really good question. I bet you That's a really good question. I bet you That's a really good question. I bet you Mike can talk about that in operations. Mike can talk about that in operations. Mike can talk about that in operations. I would say part of I would say part of I would say part of it Oh, repeat the question. Uh the it Oh, repeat the question. Uh the it Oh, repeat the question. Uh the question is, hey, you've added all this question is, hey, you've added all this question is, hey, you've added all this additional context to the sbomb. At what additional context to the sbomb. At what additional context to the sbomb. At what point are you adding too much and it point are you adding too much and it point are you adding too much and it just becomes noise? Uh, that's a great just becomes noise? Uh, that's a great just becomes noise? Uh, that's a great question. Um, I think at least from my question. Um, I think at least from my question. Um, I think at least from my perspective and then I'll have Mike Mike perspective and then I'll have Mike Mike perspective and then I'll have Mike Mike jump in. I think um you don't really jump in. I think um you don't really jump in. I think um you don't really know how your your user is going to use know how your your user is going to use know how your your user is going to use your sbomb and so more data is is your sbomb and so more data is is your sbomb and so more data is is better. Um, and so I think like I talk a better. Um, and so I think like I talk a better. Um, and so I think like I talk a little bit about the license use case little bit about the license use case little bit about the license use case and the deep scanning necessity that I and the deep scanning necessity that I and the deep scanning necessity that I have. So this information is really have. So this information is really have. So this information is really useful there. Um but Mike maybe you can useful there. Um but Mike maybe you can useful there. Um but Mike maybe you can give someone a different perspective give someone a different perspective give someone a different perspective here. Um so I think it it it's highly here. Um so I think it it it's highly here. Um so I think it it it's highly dependent dependent dependent on what is the purpose of the what are on what is the purpose of the what are on what is the purpose of the what are you trying to communicate to whoever is you trying to communicate to whoever is you trying to communicate to whoever is consuming that sbomb. So for example, if consuming that sbomb. So for example, if consuming that sbomb. So for example, if you're just trying to communicate like you're just trying to communicate like you're just trying to communicate like software composition including for software composition including for software composition including for example uh uh you know let's say example uh uh you know let's say example uh uh you know let's say up-to-date vulnerability metadata is up-to-date vulnerability metadata is up-to-date vulnerability metadata is maybe not the most important thing maybe not the most important thing maybe not the most important thing because again that's just going to be a because again that's just going to be a because again that's just going to be a snapshot in time. But um and you know snapshot in time. But um and you know snapshot in time. But um and you know Ian's brought this up a few times is Ian's brought this up a few times is Ian's brought this up a few times is communicating for example if you're communicating for example if you're communicating for example if you're trying to communicate to your customer trying to communicate to your customer trying to communicate to your customer these are the vulnerabilities we know these are the vulnerabilities we know these are the vulnerabilities we know about right now that are in the product. about right now that are in the product. about right now that are in the product. Hey, it makes sense to actually Hey, it makes sense to actually Hey, it makes sense to actually communicate that as part of the sbomb. communicate that as part of the sbomb. communicate that as part of the sbomb. So if you're using it for, you know, so So if you're using it for, you know, so So if you're using it for, you know, so really sort of depends on the purpose really sort of depends on the purpose really sort of depends on the purpose that you're trying to use it for, but that you're trying to use it for, but that you're trying to use it for, but generally I think it's if the generally I think it's if the generally I think it's if the information is useful, obviously it'd be information is useful, obviously it'd be information is useful, obviously it'd be nice to include it. Um, but it depends nice to include it. Um, but it depends nice to include it. Um, but it depends again on it's usually some sort of again on it's usually some sort of again on it's usually some sort of communication between the producer and communication between the producer and communication between the producer and the consumer of that sbomb on what the consumer of that sbomb on what the consumer of that sbomb on what they're trying to get out of it. And they're trying to get out of it. And they're trying to get out of it. And we'll learn more I think in the we'll learn more I think in the we'll learn more I think in the operation section about like how you can operation section about like how you can operation section about like how you can sort of do some of that without sort of do some of that without sort of do some of that without necessarily getting everything into the necessarily getting everything into the necessarily getting everything into the sbomb especially if some of that data is sbomb especially if some of that data is sbomb especially if some of that data is going to be temporal like going to be temporal like going to be temporal like vulnerabilities plus I think the other fact is that the plus I think the other fact is that the plus I think the other fact is that the more information you have in the SOM more information you have in the SOM more information you have in the SOM it's always possible to take like a it's always possible to take like a it's always possible to take like a fully loaded esom and list it to a fully loaded esom and list it to a fully loaded esom and list it to a simpler document that is more fit to the simpler document that is more fit to the simpler document that is more fit to the use case And because the other way use case And because the other way use case And because the other way around, it's impossible to go back. If around, it's impossible to go back. If around, it's impossible to go back. If you have like S1 missing data, you you have like S1 missing data, you you have like S1 missing data, you cannot submit it unless you go to a pro cannot submit it unless you go to a pro cannot submit it unless you go to a pro like this. like this. like this. See if this works. See if this works. See if this works. Great question. Hey, thank you. Great question. Hey, thank you. Great question. Hey, thank you. Um, my goodness, I'll just put it Um, my goodness, I'll just put it Um, my goodness, I'll just put it farther away. Uh, my question is about farther away. Uh, my question is about farther away. Uh, my question is about relationships. Now, SPDX at least has a relationships. Now, SPDX at least has a relationships. Now, SPDX at least has a great potential to track um what I what great potential to track um what I what great potential to track um what I what I consider parent child relationships I consider parent child relationships I consider parent child relationships between software packages. And one of between software packages. And one of between software packages. And one of the biggest problems we face is um the biggest problems we face is um the biggest problems we face is um knowing about those relationships or knowing about those relationships or knowing about those relationships or being able to detect those relationships being able to detect those relationships being able to detect those relationships between multiple components in your between multiple components in your between multiple components in your ESBOM. Are there any tools on the open ESBOM. Are there any tools on the open ESBOM. Are there any tools on the open source market that you know of right now source market that you know of right now source market that you know of right now that could add potential relationships that could add potential relationships that could add potential relationships like not knowingly but perhaps even just like not knowingly but perhaps even just like not knowingly but perhaps even just like the potential of a relationship like the potential of a relationship like the potential of a relationship between two software packages? between two software packages? between two software packages? Um so there's uh we'll learn later about Um so there's uh we'll learn later about Um so there's uh we'll learn later about a tool called guac that is in the open a tool called guac that is in the open a tool called guac that is in the open ssf that that does some of this but in ssf that that does some of this but in ssf that that does some of this but in addition um there's a from Google addition um there's a from Google addition um there's a from Google there's an open-source uh API called there's an open-source uh API called there's an open-source uh API called deps.dev deps.dev deps.dev devs.dev. It's a it's a website that it devs.dev. It's a it's a website that it devs.dev. It's a it's a website that it itself has a bunch of information about itself has a bunch of information about itself has a bunch of information about the relationships inside of um uh the relationships inside of um uh the relationships inside of um uh different open source packages. And different open source packages. And different open source packages. And again, some of that is going to be again, some of that is going to be again, some of that is going to be speculative speculative speculative because until you've actually built the because until you've actually built the because until you've actually built the software, you don't always know did it software, you don't always know did it software, you don't always know did it pull in version 1.2 or 1.3 pull in version 1.2 or 1.3 pull in version 1.2 or 1.3 um and stuff like that. But but deps.dev um and stuff like that. But but deps.dev um and stuff like that. But but deps.dev is also a really good uh place and and is also a really good uh place and and is also a really good uh place and and later we'll learn a little bit how guac later we'll learn a little bit how guac later we'll learn a little bit how guac uses deps.dev to to figure some of that uses deps.dev to to figure some of that uses deps.dev to to figure some of that out. Thank you. All right. So, now we have this high All right. So, now we have this high All right. So, now we have this high I'll say higher quality, maybe more I'll say higher quality, maybe more I'll say higher quality, maybe more complete. Uh, man, no one jumped on complete. Uh, man, no one jumped on complete. Uh, man, no one jumped on that. No one wanted to jump on like the that. No one wanted to jump on like the that. No one wanted to jump on like the quality debate. Um, so now what do we quality debate. Um, so now what do we quality debate. Um, so now what do we do? We're gonna we're going to look at do? We're gonna we're going to look at do? We're gonna we're going to look at verification and I'm going to turn it verification and I'm going to turn it verification and I'm going to turn it over to Porco to talk about that. All right. So verification, what does it All right. So verification, what does it All right. So verification, what does it mean to verify the end results? Um, so mean to verify the end results? Um, so mean to verify the end results? Um, so there's verifying the results is at that there's verifying the results is at that there's verifying the results is at that at times it can be super subjective. Uh, at times it can be super subjective. Uh, at times it can be super subjective. Uh, but uh we can do but uh we can do but uh we can do some some analysis. I mean the first one some some analysis. I mean the first one some some analysis. I mean the first one is there's the formal verification if it is there's the formal verification if it is there's the formal verification if it meets the spec or whatever. But I think meets the spec or whatever. But I think meets the spec or whatever. But I think it's more important to go into the it's more important to go into the it's more important to go into the semantic details added by the enrichment semantic details added by the enrichment semantic details added by the enrichment and augmentation process. Um so this uh and augmentation process. Um so this uh and augmentation process. Um so this uh this is using uh another uh tool from uh this is using uh another uh tool from uh this is using uh another uh tool from uh uh interlink called sbombqs that uh interlink called sbombqs that uh interlink called sbombqs that attempts to like has opinions on what is attempts to like has opinions on what is attempts to like has opinions on what is good quality. So you run anom through it good quality. So you run anom through it good quality. So you run anom through it and it gives you some some quality and it gives you some some quality and it gives you some some quality measures. Um so this is uh this is the measures. Um so this is uh this is the measures. Um so this is uh this is the results on the on the augmented sbomb. results on the on the augmented sbomb. results on the on the augmented sbomb. Um so here's a like a comparison between Um so here's a like a comparison between Um so here's a like a comparison between the sbomb before the enrichment and the sbomb before the enrichment and the sbomb before the enrichment and augmentation process and after uh the augmentation process and after uh the augmentation process and after uh the augmentation. So uh as you can see for augmentation. So uh as you can see for augmentation. So uh as you can see for example in the NIA minimum elements example in the NIA minimum elements example in the NIA minimum elements category uh it went from having zero category uh it went from having zero category uh it went from having zero components with a supplier defined uh to components with a supplier defined uh to components with a supplier defined uh to uh a bunch of them like a really nice uh a bunch of them like a really nice uh a bunch of them like a really nice improvement. So from uh from zero uh and improvement. So from uh from zero uh and improvement. So from uh from zero uh and then uh to going all the way to uh 4,000 then uh to going all the way to uh 4,000 then uh to going all the way to uh 4,000 uh 2,000 of the 4,000 components having uh 2,000 of the 4,000 components having uh 2,000 of the 4,000 components having a defined uh supplier uh which is a a defined uh supplier uh which is a a defined uh supplier uh which is a substantial uh adding of information. Um substantial uh adding of information. Um substantial uh adding of information. Um the SOM authors uh we added who is the SOM authors uh we added who is the SOM authors uh we added who is generating the SOMO. So now it's passing generating the SOMO. So now it's passing generating the SOMO. So now it's passing that check. Um as Ian mentioned in uh a that check. Um as Ian mentioned in uh a that check. Um as Ian mentioned in uh a bunch of the components now have bunch of the components now have bunch of the components now have licensing information uh that improves licensing information uh that improves licensing information uh that improves the score and um it's also detecting the score and um it's also detecting the score and um it's also detecting deprecated licenses in the in the code. deprecated licenses in the in the code. deprecated licenses in the in the code. Um all right. Um all right. Um all right. So going back to that uh discussion So going back to that uh discussion So going back to that uh discussion about about about um about uh the relationships in the um about uh the relationships in the um about uh the relationships in the components. Um so we can so first it's components. Um so we can so first it's components. Um so we can so first it's important to see uh if the structure of important to see uh if the structure of important to see uh if the structure of the sbomb more or less looks sane before the sbomb more or less looks sane before the sbomb more or less looks sane before uh this is kind of the verifications to uh this is kind of the verifications to uh this is kind of the verifications to do like we can do manually before do like we can do manually before do like we can do manually before letting the sbomb into into the wild. So letting the sbomb into into the wild. So letting the sbomb into into the wild. So if we go back if we go back if we go back here to our uh to our exercise here to our uh to our exercise here to our uh to our exercise environment. So we have so we have this environment. So we have so we have this environment. So we have so we have this uh this small tool uh it's coming to the uh this small tool uh it's coming to the uh this small tool uh it's coming to the proto project. Uh so the idea is uh for proto project. Uh so the idea is uh for proto project. Uh so the idea is uh for those of you who are not familiar those of you who are not familiar those of you who are not familiar protoom is like a like a um an we call protoom is like a like a um an we call protoom is like a like a um an we call it like an IO layer for som data. Uh it it like an IO layer for som data. Uh it it like an IO layer for som data. Uh it is it is a neutral representation of is it is a neutral representation of is it is a neutral representation of sbomb data. So we ingest any format and sbomb data. So we ingest any format and sbomb data. So we ingest any format and can write any format. Um, and this can write any format. Um, and this can write any format. Um, and this library is part of a new project that's library is part of a new project that's library is part of a new project that's coming to the Protobam universe. Uh, coming to the Protobam universe. Uh, coming to the Protobam universe. Uh, intended to be able to make dependencies intended to be able to make dependencies intended to be able to make dependencies from a bunch whole uh, different data from a bunch whole uh, different data from a bunch whole uh, different data sources uh, to make the dependency data sources uh, to make the dependency data sources uh, to make the dependency data visible to Protobon. Right now, we can visible to Protobon. Right now, we can visible to Protobon. Right now, we can ingest the documents by themselves. But ingest the documents by themselves. But ingest the documents by themselves. But we also want to uh, make the project we also want to uh, make the project we also want to uh, make the project aware of uh, dependency data from other aware of uh, dependency data from other aware of uh, dependency data from other sources. And as part of that uh we're sources. And as part of that uh we're sources. And as part of that uh we're building also a visualization in building also a visualization in building also a visualization in graphing uh library and which can render graphing uh library and which can render graphing uh library and which can render simple uh one of the drivers that it has simple uh one of the drivers that it has simple uh one of the drivers that it has it can render in the terminal it can render in the terminal it can render in the terminal um the dependency data. So we can ingest um the dependency data. So we can ingest um the dependency data. So we can ingest the enriches and then it shows us the uh the enriches and then it shows us the uh the enriches and then it shows us the uh the graph that turned out like this is only graph that turned out like this is only graph that turned out like this is only important to understand where everything important to understand where everything important to understand where everything uh so you see the the go mode um package uh so you see the the go mode um package uh so you see the the go mode um package at top the cubectl u module and then at top the cubectl u module and then at top the cubectl u module and then from there all of the the language from there all of the the language from there all of the the language dependencies I mean that's that's simple dependencies I mean that's that's simple dependencies I mean that's that's simple like a simple uh example how to to see like a simple uh example how to to see like a simple uh example how to to see the data inside of the the data inside of the the data inside of the S1 Uh so the other one is um in the S1 Uh so the other one is um in the S1 Uh so the other one is um in the openf we had like a probably too long a openf we had like a probably too long a openf we had like a probably too long a conversation how to name me bombs uh conversation how to name me bombs uh conversation how to name me bombs uh because it like everybody's pushing out because it like everybody's pushing out because it like everybody's pushing out sbombs in the in the GitHub releases. So sbombs in the in the GitHub releases. So sbombs in the in the GitHub releases. So we're trying to come up with well what's we're trying to come up with well what's we're trying to come up with well what's the best way of like can we just agree the best way of like can we just agree the best way of like can we just agree on a name so that all the open source on a name so that all the open source on a name so that all the open source projects more or less publish using the projects more or less publish using the projects more or less publish using the the same the same schema. So we came up the same the same schema. So we came up the same the same schema. So we came up with this naming recommendation. It's in with this naming recommendation. It's in with this naming recommendation. It's in a document in the ESM everywhere group a document in the ESM everywhere group a document in the ESM everywhere group in the in the in the openf. So probably uh we should return openf. So probably uh we should return openf. So probably uh we should return to and rename our S1 to and rename our S1 to and rename our S1 um to follow the the standard. um to follow the the standard. um to follow the the standard. So I'm going to copy this one. Control V. Okay. Okay. So we now Okay. So we now Okay. So we now have an S1 named in in that in that way. have an S1 named in in that in that way. have an S1 named in in that in that way. Okay. So now signing the S1. So we're Okay. So now signing the S1. So we're Okay. So now signing the S1. So we're going to go into two ways of adding Oh, going to go into two ways of adding Oh, going to go into two ways of adding Oh, sorry Christian. How did the ESPOM meet the minimum How did the ESPOM meet the minimum How did the ESPOM meet the minimum elements? elements? elements? How did Yeah. When you were showing it How did Yeah. When you were showing it How did Yeah. When you were showing it on the screen, you said you had enriched on the screen, you said you had enriched on the screen, you said you had enriched it. You ran a tool on it. Looking at it. You ran a tool on it. Looking at it. You ran a tool on it. Looking at that, it's much better, but does it meet that, it's much better, but does it meet that, it's much better, but does it meet all of the minimum L? Yeah. So, not not all of the minimum L? Yeah. So, not not all of the minimum L? Yeah. So, not not all of them have a 10 score. Um, so if all of them have a 10 score. Um, so if all of them have a 10 score. Um, so if you see the components with supplier, you see the components with supplier, you see the components with supplier, we're still missing some of them, which we're still missing some of them, which we're still missing some of them, which would mean that it's not there yet would mean that it's not there yet would mean that it's not there yet completely. completely. completely. a lot of a lot of the components you may a lot of a lot of the components you may a lot of a lot of the components you may find are like intermediary find are like intermediary find are like intermediary components. So, you know, you're components. So, you know, you're components. So, you know, you're generating an SBOM. Um, what I found is generating an SBOM. Um, what I found is generating an SBOM. Um, what I found is sometimes they're intermediary sometimes they're intermediary sometimes they're intermediary components that are part of your build components that are part of your build components that are part of your build and they don't trace back to an open and they don't trace back to an open and they don't trace back to an open source package. And so, in that case, source package. And so, in that case, source package. And so, in that case, it's kind of on you it's kind of on you it's kind of on you to you are the author of those to you are the author of those to you are the author of those components, those intermediary components, those intermediary components, those intermediary components. Um, and so there are I'll components. Um, and so there are I'll components. Um, and so there are I'll say eco uh there format specific tooling say eco uh there format specific tooling say eco uh there format specific tooling that does a really good job with that, that does a really good job with that, that does a really good job with that, but because we're trying to be format but because we're trying to be format but because we're trying to be format agnostic here, we kind of left those out agnostic here, we kind of left those out agnostic here, we kind of left those out of the slides, but yeah, a lot of the of the slides, but yeah, a lot of the of the slides, but yeah, a lot of the times what I have found is yes, there's times what I have found is yes, there's times what I have found is yes, there's always going to be some information always going to be some information always going to be some information that's missing. Um, and then especially that's missing. Um, and then especially that's missing. Um, and then especially if you look at stuff like uh I think if you look at stuff like uh I think if you look at stuff like uh I think there's some great scoring in here that there's some great scoring in here that there's some great scoring in here that you can see didn't do very well, like you can see didn't do very well, like you can see didn't do very well, like this multiple vulnerability lookup ID, I this multiple vulnerability lookup ID, I this multiple vulnerability lookup ID, I think is a really good one. Um, I don't think is a really good one. Um, I don't think is a really good one. Um, I don't see a lot of tools that do both CPE see a lot of tools that do both CPE see a lot of tools that do both CPE Pearl um as part of like their typical Pearl um as part of like their typical Pearl um as part of like their typical uh generated sbombs and so I think those uh generated sbombs and so I think those uh generated sbombs and so I think those are areas for the tools to improve. I'm are areas for the tools to improve. I'm are areas for the tools to improve. I'm dancing a little a little bit around dancing a little a little bit around dancing a little a little bit around what you're saying which is like hey is what you're saying which is like hey is what you're saying which is like hey is this is this meeting the NTA minimum this is this meeting the NTA minimum this is this meeting the NTA minimum elements and I be honest I say for most elements and I be honest I say for most elements and I be honest I say for most part it's best effort today. Um I've yet part it's best effort today. Um I've yet part it's best effort today. Um I've yet to see a lot of best bumps that truly to see a lot of best bumps that truly to see a lot of best bumps that truly meet the NTI minimum elements. I think meet the NTI minimum elements. I think meet the NTI minimum elements. I think in the spirit of like what's what's in the spirit of like what's what's in the spirit of like what's what's intended because you can do a lot of intended because you can do a lot of intended because you can do a lot of like no assertions all over the place. like no assertions all over the place. like no assertions all over the place. People will be like yeah you meet the People will be like yeah you meet the People will be like yeah you meet the minimum elements like well no you didn't minimum elements like well no you didn't minimum elements like well no you didn't you didn't meet the intent. Okay so moving on to signing. intent. Okay so moving on to signing. intent. Okay so moving on to signing. Um so we're going to see two ways of Um so we're going to see two ways of Um so we're going to see two ways of signing the documents. One is uh a signing the documents. One is uh a signing the documents. One is uh a simple detach signature uh where you simple detach signature uh where you simple detach signature uh where you distribute your document along with a distribute your document along with a distribute your document along with a certificate and the signature so that certificate and the signature so that certificate and the signature so that you can verify it. This is these you can verify it. This is these you can verify it. This is these examples uh all use six which is a examples uh all use six which is a examples uh all use six which is a project of the openf to make signing project of the openf to make signing project of the openf to make signing easier. Um we don't we won't go into easier. Um we don't we won't go into easier. Um we don't we won't go into into that but well we'll show the the into that but well we'll show the the into that but well we'll show the the example. So let me it's a little bit example. So let me it's a little bit example. So let me it's a little bit tricky to run it tricky to run it tricky to run it in in the um in the git in in the um in the git in in the um in the git environment. Oh okay. So oh well we have environment. Oh okay. So oh well we have environment. Oh okay. So oh well we have an intermediate step here. Uh so we need an intermediate step here. Uh so we need an intermediate step here. Uh so we need to uh once we did the verification and to uh once we did the verification and to uh once we did the verification and before distributing the sbomb something before distributing the sbomb something before distributing the sbomb something else that is useful is creating a uh the else that is useful is creating a uh the else that is useful is creating a uh the so we've been working with a cyclone so we've been working with a cyclone so we've been working with a cyclone DXSO so to have maximum compatibility DXSO so to have maximum compatibility DXSO so to have maximum compatibility with our uh recipients it's always a with our uh recipients it's always a with our uh recipients it's always a good practice to also generate the the good practice to also generate the the good practice to also generate the the same on the other standard. Uh to do same on the other standard. Uh to do same on the other standard. Uh to do that I'm using the same that I'm using the same that I'm using the same um the same tool I showed earlier to to um the same tool I showed earlier to to um the same tool I showed earlier to to visualize except so this is just a tiny visualize except so this is just a tiny visualize except so this is just a tiny wrapper around in front of the libraries wrapper around in front of the libraries wrapper around in front of the libraries for ESOM uh for for dependency injection for ESOM uh for for dependency injection for ESOM uh for for dependency injection into protoone and what it what this does into protoone and what it what this does into protoone and what it what this does like it it's not a translator but it like it it's not a translator but it like it it's not a translator but it only reads an SOM and writes it out in only reads an SOM and writes it out in only reads an SOM and writes it out in another format. So instead of just another format. So instead of just another format. So instead of just printing out the the terminal output printing out the the terminal output printing out the the terminal output like that, it's just going to uh spit it like that, it's just going to uh spit it like that, it's just going to uh spit it out in out in out in SPDX. Um so if I were to show you the um SPDX. Um so if I were to show you the um SPDX. Um so if I were to show you the um the resulting output, uh it should the resulting output, uh it should the resulting output, uh it should probably be probably be probably be uh equivalent to to the other one that uh equivalent to to the other one that uh equivalent to to the other one that we uh that we just showed. Um So you you'll see that the same So you you'll see that the same So you you'll see that the same information is contained in here. Uh information is contained in here. Uh information is contained in here. Uh okay. So let's let's uh go back to signing. So to signing. So to signing. So to sign we're going to use cosign which is sign we're going to use cosign which is sign we're going to use cosign which is the the the command line client for uh the the the command line client for uh the the the command line client for uh for sig store. Uh so this is going to do for sig store. Uh so this is going to do for sig store. Uh so this is going to do uh when I run this it's going to uh grab uh when I run this it's going to uh grab uh when I run this it's going to uh grab the sbomb file as a blob generate the the sbomb file as a blob generate the the sbomb file as a blob generate the signatures and that I think about it. Let's see if and that I think about it. Let's see if and that I think about it. Let's see if we have an account to to go through the we have an account to to go through the we have an account to to go through the flow here. flow here. flow here. Um, so uses Okay, uses Okay, uses Okay, copy. Let's see if this works. Okay, we have a Let's give a works. Okay, we have a Let's give a works. Okay, we have a Let's give a GitHub account GitHub account GitHub account here. Okay, I think it's going to work. here. Okay, I think it's going to work. here. Okay, I think it's going to work. So, Cixer uses an identity provider to So, Cixer uses an identity provider to So, Cixer uses an identity provider to generate a temporary certificate for you generate a temporary certificate for you generate a temporary certificate for you so that you can sign the documents and so that you can sign the documents and so that you can sign the documents and then you so this is in in like in if you then you so this is in in like in if you then you so this is in in like in if you were doing this on your desktop it would were doing this on your desktop it would were doing this on your desktop it would come like it would pop up uh your come like it would pop up uh your come like it would pop up uh your browser you just click on it and it's browser you just click on it and it's browser you just click on it and it's done but since since this is not done but since since this is not done but since since this is not detecting the browser here in the git detecting the browser here in the git detecting the browser here in the git environment it's using the device flow environment it's using the device flow environment it's using the device flow where it gives you like gives you a URL where it gives you like gives you a URL where it gives you like gives you a URL and you come back with the code manually and you come back with the code manually and you come back with the code manually Okay. So, it's there. So, now we can see Okay. So, it's there. So, now we can see Okay. So, it's there. So, now we can see that we have the certificate here and that we have the certificate here and that we have the certificate here and the the the signature. signature. signature. And to to we'll do the same for And to to we'll do the same for And to to we'll do the same for the SPDX variant. So, we have it here. So this is using the the temporary So this is using the the temporary So this is using the the temporary GitHub account that we created for the GitHub account that we created for the GitHub account that we created for the subject to ident to identify itself and subject to ident to identify itself and subject to ident to identify itself and then generate the certificates. Okay. So then generate the certificates. Okay. So then generate the certificates. Okay. So we now have the Cyclon DX version, the we now have the Cyclon DX version, the we now have the Cyclon DX version, the SPDX version and both with their um SPDX version and both with their um SPDX version and both with their um signatures and um certificates. So to signatures and um certificates. So to signatures and um certificates. So to verify uh okay, so we'll go into verify uh okay, so we'll go into verify uh okay, so we'll go into verification a little bit later uh in verification a little bit later uh in verification a little bit later uh in more depth. So I'm going to skip that more depth. So I'm going to skip that more depth. So I'm going to skip that that that section. that that section. that that section. Now the other way of signing, let me go Now the other way of signing, let me go Now the other way of signing, let me go back to the slides. back to the slides. back to the slides. Uh so the other way of signing is um Uh so the other way of signing is um Uh so the other way of signing is um generating an attestation with the sbomb generating an attestation with the sbomb generating an attestation with the sbomb in them. Uh so in there are a lot of in them. Uh so in there are a lot of in them. Uh so in there are a lot of projects in the supply chain uh sphere projects in the supply chain uh sphere projects in the supply chain uh sphere especially in the openf where we think especially in the openf where we think especially in the openf where we think that the best way of generating a like a that the best way of generating a like a that the best way of generating a like a visible and more transparent supply visible and more transparent supply visible and more transparent supply chain is by generating metadata as your chain is by generating metadata as your chain is by generating metadata as your software builds and gets tested and gets software builds and gets tested and gets software builds and gets tested and gets distributed and all of that information distributed and all of that information distributed and all of that information should be captured in on forgeable should be captured in on forgeable should be captured in on forgeable documents which we call attestations uh documents which we call attestations uh documents which we call attestations uh and of which the S1 is only one one kind and of which the S1 is only one one kind and of which the S1 is only one one kind of um so for example you can have uh of um so for example you can have uh of um so for example you can have uh attestations detailing how the software attestations detailing how the software attestations detailing how the software will was built uh which we call will was built uh which we call will was built uh which we call provenence attestations uh you can have provenence attestations uh you can have provenence attestations uh you can have testations relating what kind of testing testations relating what kind of testing testations relating what kind of testing tools you apply to your uh your software tools you apply to your uh your software tools you apply to your uh your software as it was built. you can capture the as it was built. you can capture the as it was built. you can capture the results of vulnerability scans and an results of vulnerability scans and an results of vulnerability scans and an attestation. And the idea is that at attestation. And the idea is that at attestation. And the idea is that at each step of the of the build process each step of the of the build process each step of the of the build process and the software development life cycle, and the software development life cycle, and the software development life cycle, you start generating more and more you start generating more and more you start generating more and more information so that you get you can make information so that you get you can make information so that you get you can make more informed decisions uh regarding how more informed decisions uh regarding how more informed decisions uh regarding how secure the software you're getting from secure the software you're getting from secure the software you're getting from the previous link in the supply chain um the previous link in the supply chain um the previous link in the supply chain um is and then and also detect the the is and then and also detect the the is and then and also detect the the missing uh pieces. So you can answer missing uh pieces. So you can answer missing uh pieces. So you can answer questions as for example, what kind of questions as for example, what kind of questions as for example, what kind of testing did you perform? Well, look at testing did you perform? Well, look at testing did you perform? Well, look at this the the station. What um build this the the station. What um build this the the station. What um build system was used to build this piece of system was used to build this piece of system was used to build this piece of software that I'm getting? Who were the software that I'm getting? Who were the software that I'm getting? Who were the people involved in uh adding all of the people involved in uh adding all of the people involved in uh adding all of the commits to the codebase? All of that can commits to the codebase? All of that can commits to the codebase? All of that can be captured in standard stations. And be captured in standard stations. And be captured in standard stations. And the the same is true for the Sbomb. So the the same is true for the Sbomb. So the the same is true for the Sbomb. So if you want to have um an SBOM that you if you want to have um an SBOM that you if you want to have um an SBOM that you know was generating for example was know was generating for example was know was generating for example was generated for example at the same moment generated for example at the same moment generated for example at the same moment that the build was. uh so the same build that the build was. uh so the same build that the build was. uh so the same build system and same um source code was used system and same um source code was used system and same um source code was used to build the system and also generate to build the system and also generate to build the system and also generate the S1 that can be captured on the test the S1 that can be captured on the test the S1 that can be captured on the test station. So it's very valuable to to station. So it's very valuable to to station. So it's very valuable to to have it there. Um there are many tools have it there. Um there are many tools have it there. Um there are many tools that uh can be done but I'm I'm going to that uh can be done but I'm I'm going to that uh can be done but I'm I'm going to do it with another do it with another do it with another uh another pre-release uh tool that uh uh another pre-release uh tool that uh uh another pre-release uh tool that uh we're building to make this super easy. we're building to make this super easy. we're building to make this super easy. Um so the important thing with the at Um so the important thing with the at Um so the important thing with the at the station is that you have what we the station is that you have what we the station is that you have what we call the predicate which in this case is call the predicate which in this case is call the predicate which in this case is the esom and it's always tied to a the esom and it's always tied to a the esom and it's always tied to a subject which is something most of the subject which is something most of the subject which is something most of the times a hashable object which is a file. times a hashable object which is a file. times a hashable object which is a file. So in our case uh we're going to be So in our case uh we're going to be So in our case uh we're going to be attesting to the cubectl darble that attesting to the cubectl darble that attesting to the cubectl darble that downloaded in the first uh in the first downloaded in the first uh in the first downloaded in the first uh in the first uh step. So let me uh step. So let me uh step. So let me go and copy the example code here. Um so this is a a small tool here. Um so this is a a small tool here. Um so this is a a small tool called bind which is also going to called bind which is also going to called bind which is also going to probably make it into one of the open probably make it into one of the open probably make it into one of the open and nesf projects at some point. Um it and nesf projects at some point. Um it and nesf projects at some point. Um it just uh makes it easy to work with at just uh makes it easy to work with at just uh makes it easy to work with at the stations and has all of the six door the stations and has all of the six door the stations and has all of the six door uh signing built in. Uh so I'm going to uh signing built in. Uh so I'm going to uh signing built in. Uh so I'm going to go go go and do the same here. There There There is. So this is going to go through the is. So this is going to go through the is. So this is going to go through the same flow same flow same flow gen the sign at the station. station. station. And we'll do the same for the shut up brother mouse. Okay. Okay. There it is. Okay, same authenticate with GitHub. Get this question. this question. this question. Oh, did you when you did you resign the did you when you did you resign the did you when you did you resign the sbomb that was signed by sig store or sbomb that was signed by sig store or sbomb that was signed by sig store or did you sign a you know an sbomb that did you sign a you know an sbomb that did you sign a you know an sbomb that hadn't been digitally signed yet when hadn't been digitally signed yet when hadn't been digitally signed yet when you did the addestation? So in the case you did the addestation? So in the case you did the addestation? So in the case of on the first example just signing of on the first example just signing of on the first example just signing with the uh the touch signatures we have with the uh the touch signatures we have with the uh the touch signatures we have the som here and then we have the the som here and then we have the the som here and then we have the signatures this is a certificate and and signatures this is a certificate and and signatures this is a certificate and and the signature. So in that case you have the signature. So in that case you have the signature. So in that case you have the original sbomb untouched and then the original sbomb untouched and then the original sbomb untouched and then the other two files. So if you the other two files. So if you the other two files. So if you distribute them you need to grab those distribute them you need to grab those distribute them you need to grab those three and put them in your GitHub three and put them in your GitHub three and put them in your GitHub releases. And in the case of the releases. And in the case of the releases. And in the case of the attestation, we now have an attestation attestation, we now have an attestation attestation, we now have an attestation here. And inside of that is everything here. And inside of that is everything here. And inside of that is everything contained in a in a redistributable contained in a in a redistributable contained in a in a redistributable uh bundle. So I'm I'm going to I'm going uh bundle. So I'm I'm going to I'm going uh bundle. So I'm I'm going to I'm going to we're going to explore what's inside to we're going to explore what's inside to we're going to explore what's inside of that file in a little bit. Awesome. of that file in a little bit. Awesome. of that file in a little bit. Awesome. And can you talk just a little bit more And can you talk just a little bit more And can you talk just a little bit more about Bang? Was it like b the name of about Bang? Was it like b the name of about Bang? Was it like b the name of the small tool that's looking for a the small tool that's looking for a the small tool that's looking for a home? Yeah, it's a it's a small tool home? Yeah, it's a it's a small tool home? Yeah, it's a it's a small tool under development that uh is trying to under development that uh is trying to under development that uh is trying to tie all of this together. Um so probably tie all of this together. Um so probably tie all of this together. Um so probably my thinking is we're going to donate it my thinking is we're going to donate it my thinking is we're going to donate it to something. I don't know. Uh but right to something. I don't know. Uh but right to something. I don't know. Uh but right now it's it's just like using all of now it's it's just like using all of now it's it's just like using all of those technologies into one to make it those technologies into one to make it those technologies into one to make it easy. It's just like a CLI to to to make easy. It's just like a CLI to to to make easy. It's just like a CLI to to to make this like seamless. Thank you. Yeah, I'm this like seamless. Thank you. Yeah, I'm this like seamless. Thank you. Yeah, I'm we're going to see a little bit more of we're going to see a little bit more of we're going to see a little bit more of that. that. that. Um then Um then Um then uh all right so going back to the slide uh all right so going back to the slide uh all right so going back to the slide so now we have as we mentioned we have so now we have as we mentioned we have so now we have as we mentioned we have the sbomb the plain sbomb the signature the sbomb the plain sbomb the signature the sbomb the plain sbomb the signature and certificates and we also have two and certificates and we also have two and certificates and we also have two other variants of the same sbombs. Uh so other variants of the same sbombs. Uh so other variants of the same sbombs. Uh so this is the cyclone this is the cyclone this is the cyclone dx a tested sbomb wrapped in all of the dx a tested sbomb wrapped in all of the dx a tested sbomb wrapped in all of the verification material with the sixster verification material with the sixster verification material with the sixster signatures in that. So when you have signatures in that. So when you have signatures in that. So when you have when you have a bundle like this uh you when you have a bundle like this uh you when you have a bundle like this uh you have at the very very very core of it have at the very very very core of it have at the very very very core of it you have the S one and then that one is you have the S one and then that one is you have the S one and then that one is wrapped in an I have a slide that more wrapped in an I have a slide that more wrapped in an I have a slide that more or less. So here it is. So you have at or less. So here it is. So you have at or less. So here it is. So you have at the very core the blue part is the the very core the blue part is the the very core the blue part is the predicate which is the S1 like the predicate which is the S1 like the predicate which is the S1 like the untouched unmodified S1. Then that one untouched unmodified S1. Then that one untouched unmodified S1. Then that one is wrapped in the attestation and it's is wrapped in the attestation and it's is wrapped in the attestation and it's spared together with a subject which spared together with a subject which spared together with a subject which binds it to the to the artifact that we binds it to the to the artifact that we binds it to the to the artifact that we are attesting to. And then around it, it are attesting to. And then around it, it are attesting to. And then around it, it has more JSON which contains um all of has more JSON which contains um all of has more JSON which contains um all of the verification material needed to do the verification material needed to do the verification material needed to do the actual signature. So it has the the actual signature. So it has the the actual signature. So it has the signature, it has the certificates, it signature, it has the certificates, it signature, it has the certificates, it has the time time stamp inclusion uh has the time time stamp inclusion uh has the time time stamp inclusion uh proof that six ads so that you can proof that six ads so that you can proof that six ads so that you can verify that when you signed the SBOM the verify that when you signed the SBOM the verify that when you signed the SBOM the certificate was valid and all of that certificate was valid and all of that certificate was valid and all of that gets packed into a single uh gets packed into a single uh gets packed into a single uh distribution distributable file that you distribution distributable file that you distribution distributable file that you can use to verify which we're going to can use to verify which we're going to can use to verify which we're going to do in a little do in a little do in a little bit. So what do you do with with those bit. So what do you do with with those bit. So what do you do with with those two variants of the S1? Well, the common two variants of the S1? Well, the common two variants of the S1? Well, the common practice that we've been uh suggesting practice that we've been uh suggesting practice that we've been uh suggesting is that you take those two files that is that you take those two files that is that you take those two files that already are packing a lot and then you already are packing a lot and then you already are packing a lot and then you basically transform them into transform basically transform them into transform basically transform them into transform them into a single line JSON and put them into a single line JSON and put them into a single line JSON and put them all in a JSON L file linear JSON them all in a JSON L file linear JSON them all in a JSON L file linear JSON which is one JSON document per line and which is one JSON document per line and which is one JSON document per line and then that way you can pack all of your then that way you can pack all of your then that way you can pack all of your attestations. So in this case two at the attestations. So in this case two at the attestations. So in this case two at the station H41 S1 but then in the same file station H41 S1 but then in the same file station H41 S1 but then in the same file you could distribute all of the you could distribute all of the you could distribute all of the provenence information all of the provenence information all of the provenence information all of the vulnerability uh reports attested vulnerability uh reports attested vulnerability uh reports attested everything in the single in the single everything in the single in the single everything in the single in the single file and so with the same tool we can do file and so with the same tool we can do file and so with the same tool we can do the same I just put the same I just put the same I just put here and then this will produce um a here and then this will produce um a here and then this will produce um a single a single um a single bundle. So single a single um a single bundle. So single a single um a single bundle. So this one, so this JSON L bundle is a this one, so this JSON L bundle is a this one, so this JSON L bundle is a file that has two lines in it with each file that has two lines in it with each file that has two lines in it with each line being the bundle of the line being the bundle of the line being the bundle of the SPDX version of the ESBOM and the bundle SPDX version of the ESBOM and the bundle SPDX version of the ESBOM and the bundle of the cyclonx version of the ESBOM of the cyclonx version of the ESBOM of the cyclonx version of the ESBOM signed and verifiable in the same one. signed and verifiable in the same one. signed and verifiable in the same one. All All All right. Um so until now we have a right. Um so until now we have a right. Um so until now we have a distributable our distributable distributable our distributable distributable our distributable artifacts. We have the plain sbombs. We artifacts. We have the plain sbombs. We artifacts. We have the plain sbombs. We have signatures and certificates for have signatures and certificates for have signatures and certificates for those sbombs. We have individual those sbombs. We have individual those sbombs. We have individual attestations and also the bundle that attestations and also the bundle that attestations and also the bundle that packs everything into a single file that packs everything into a single file that packs everything into a single file that you can you can you can distribute. distribute. distribute. Um so once you distribute it you're the Um so once you distribute it you're the Um so once you distribute it you're the recipient needs to make sense of what recipient needs to make sense of what recipient needs to make sense of what they're getting. they're getting. they're getting. So we um yeah we have a question. Yeah. So is there any logging capabilities So is there any logging capabilities So is there any logging capabilities that kind of happen on the back end just that kind of happen on the back end just that kind of happen on the back end just to make sure that wherever copyrights or to make sure that wherever copyrights or to make sure that wherever copyrights or licenses are getting grabbed is kind of licenses are getting grabbed is kind of licenses are getting grabbed is kind of tracked because I know you said you got tracked because I know you said you got tracked because I know you said you got to take note of that and there's risk to take note of that and there's risk to take note of that and there's risk you know associated with bad copyrights you know associated with bad copyrights you know associated with bad copyrights or maybe forged licenses bad redirects or maybe forged licenses bad redirects or maybe forged licenses bad redirects stuff like that. stuff like that. stuff like that. So there is a project in open SSF called So there is a project in open SSF called So there is a project in open SSF called esbombit that's trying to tackle some of esbombit that's trying to tackle some of esbombit that's trying to tackle some of that. So the idea of sbomb it is how do that. So the idea of sbomb it is how do that. So the idea of sbomb it is how do you take the same principles of you take the same principles of you take the same principles of addestations but instead of unwrapping addestations but instead of unwrapping addestations but instead of unwrapping the entire sbomb you wrap portions maybe the entire sbomb you wrap portions maybe the entire sbomb you wrap portions maybe an individual component need detail how an individual component need detail how an individual component need detail how did that component get discovered how did that component get discovered how did that component get discovered how did specific metadata about that get did specific metadata about that get did specific metadata about that get added and so I would say in general no added and so I would say in general no added and so I would say in general no to your point not today but there's a to your point not today but there's a to your point not today but there's a need to be able to compare different need to be able to compare different need to be able to compare different sbombs like one of the big things that sbombs like one of the big things that sbombs like one of the big things that people always throw shade at on this people always throw shade at on this people always throw shade at on this bomb is like hey I ran trivia and I ran bomb is like hey I ran trivia and I ran bomb is like hey I ran trivia and I ran and Sift and I got completely different and Sift and I got completely different and Sift and I got completely different counts for components. Why is that? One counts for components. Why is that? One counts for components. Why is that? One of them has to be wrong, right? And of them has to be wrong, right? And of them has to be wrong, right? And well, the reality is that's not well, the reality is that's not well, the reality is that's not necessarily the case, right? Sift may necessarily the case, right? Sift may necessarily the case, right? Sift may include your GitHub workflow files. The include your GitHub workflow files. The include your GitHub workflow files. The other one didn't. But the intent of other one didn't. But the intent of other one didn't. But the intent of Sbombit is to be able to pull out those Sbombit is to be able to pull out those Sbombit is to be able to pull out those differences and show the the origin of differences and show the the origin of differences and show the the origin of that information, how it got into that that information, how it got into that that information, how it got into that sbomb. So, Sbombit is a project that's sbomb. So, Sbombit is a project that's sbomb. So, Sbombit is a project that's trying to tackle the the the question trying to tackle the the the question trying to tackle the the the question that you have, which is how do I know that you have, which is how do I know that you have, which is how do I know how and why this information was added how and why this information was added how and why this information was added into an SBOT? into an SBOT? into an SBOT? Now, when it comes to those comparisons, Now, when it comes to those comparisons, Now, when it comes to those comparisons, um is there any significant differences um is there any significant differences um is there any significant differences in the way it's presented? If maybe one in the way it's presented? If maybe one in the way it's presented? If maybe one source is not comprehensive versus two source is not comprehensive versus two source is not comprehensive versus two sources being, you know, just completely sources being, you know, just completely sources being, you know, just completely different, they both can't exist at the different, they both can't exist at the different, they both can't exist at the same time. same time. same time. Um, I mean, I think that that's kind of Um, I mean, I think that that's kind of Um, I mean, I think that that's kind of one of the challenges with just sort of one of the challenges with just sort of one of the challenges with just sort of the SBOM tooling right now is, um, the SBOM tooling right now is, um, the SBOM tooling right now is, um, they're getting better, but again, I they're getting better, but again, I they're getting better, but again, I think a lot of times it's unclear what think a lot of times it's unclear what think a lot of times it's unclear what the intent is of what am I trying to the intent is of what am I trying to the intent is of what am I trying to communicate with you? Um, am I trying to communicate with you? Um, am I trying to communicate with you? Um, am I trying to communicate, hey, here's all the first communicate, hey, here's all the first communicate, hey, here's all the first level dependencies or am I trying to level dependencies or am I trying to level dependencies or am I trying to communicate I included as much as communicate I included as much as communicate I included as much as humanly possible. I might not be I might humanly possible. I might not be I might humanly possible. I might not be I might not have gotten all of it, but I'm not have gotten all of it, but I'm not have gotten all of it, but I'm trying to at least get get most of it. trying to at least get get most of it. trying to at least get get most of it. Um, I think that's that's one of the Um, I think that's that's one of the Um, I think that's that's one of the challenges and I think one of the things challenges and I think one of the things challenges and I think one of the things that we've been pushing in the open that we've been pushing in the open that we've been pushing in the open source community for esbomb tools to do source community for esbomb tools to do source community for esbomb tools to do a bit more of is actually say like with a bit more of is actually say like with a bit more of is actually say like with esbomb and some of the other tools is esbomb and some of the other tools is esbomb and some of the other tools is like tell me what you're actually like tell me what you're actually like tell me what you're actually describing so that if I go back can I describing so that if I go back can I describing so that if I go back can I determine no you missed something versus determine no you missed something versus determine no you missed something versus you got something wrong because right you got something wrong because right you got something wrong because right now I think it's actually very difficult now I think it's actually very difficult now I think it's actually very difficult to determine I got something wrong to determine I got something wrong to determine I got something wrong versus I just missed something. versus I just missed something. versus I just missed something. Okay, thank you. All you. All you. All right, so sharing, I got all of these right, so sharing, I got all of these right, so sharing, I got all of these distributed level artifacts. What do I distributed level artifacts. What do I distributed level artifacts. What do I do with them? Uh, so where do I put do with them? Uh, so where do I put do with them? Uh, so where do I put them? Uh, how do I see what's in them as them? Uh, how do I see what's in them as them? Uh, how do I see what's in them as a consumer that's uh especially as a a consumer that's uh especially as a a consumer that's uh especially as a consumer that's uh receiving them? consumer that's uh receiving them? consumer that's uh receiving them? So the landscape is maturing uh and then So the landscape is maturing uh and then So the landscape is maturing uh and then different areas and project types and different areas and project types and different areas and project types and open source versus commercial are in open source versus commercial are in open source versus commercial are in different at different stages. Um so different at different stages. Um so different at different stages. Um so taking this scroll walk run approach taking this scroll walk run approach taking this scroll walk run approach um what um right now so for example um um what um right now so for example um um what um right now so for example um you can if you're releasing software you can if you're releasing software you can if you're releasing software especially open source in GitHub there's especially open source in GitHub there's especially open source in GitHub there's nothing preventing you from putting nothing preventing you from putting nothing preventing you from putting those documents in the GitHub releases. those documents in the GitHub releases. those documents in the GitHub releases. Um then uh commercial uh uh folks who Um then uh commercial uh uh folks who Um then uh commercial uh uh folks who are building products to be able to to are building products to be able to to are building products to be able to to to push um the documents uh and host to push um the documents uh and host to push um the documents uh and host them and make them available are also them and make them available are also them and make them available are also like already out there. Um and then uh like already out there. Um and then uh like already out there. Um and then uh something that we are very very excited something that we are very very excited something that we are very very excited about is the the the the ecosystems about is the the the the ecosystems about is the the the the ecosystems themselves also starting to um host the themselves also starting to um host the themselves also starting to um host the sbombs in their projects. Like for sbombs in their projects. Like for sbombs in their projects. Like for example, BIP is currently in the works example, BIP is currently in the works example, BIP is currently in the works to um have all of that dependency to um have all of that dependency to um have all of that dependency information uh as part of the packages. information uh as part of the packages. information uh as part of the packages. Um you can also push espawns into OCI Um you can also push espawns into OCI Um you can also push espawns into OCI which we're going to be see an example which we're going to be see an example which we're going to be see an example in a little bit. Um and there's of in a little bit. Um and there's of in a little bit. Um and there's of course um the the commercial som course um the the commercial som course um the the commercial som exchanges uh so like manifest and GitHub exchanges uh so like manifest and GitHub exchanges uh so like manifest and GitHub also has this attestations feature. Uh also has this attestations feature. Uh also has this attestations feature. Uh so the attestations I just showed uh you so the attestations I just showed uh you so the attestations I just showed uh you can push them uh if you build the can push them uh if you build the can push them uh if you build the attestations that I showed you, you can attestations that I showed you, you can attestations that I showed you, you can push them into the GitHub attestation push them into the GitHub attestation push them into the GitHub attestation store. uh it has a few uh requirements store. uh it has a few uh requirements store. uh it has a few uh requirements but it can be done today and in the but it can be done today and in the but it can be done today and in the future we expect to see the maturing of future we expect to see the maturing of future we expect to see the maturing of uh supply chain specific uh exchanges of uh supply chain specific uh exchanges of uh supply chain specific uh exchanges of this information such as um SKID and the this information such as um SKID and the this information such as um SKID and the the transparency exchange API going on the transparency exchange API going on the transparency exchange API going on in um in um in um Adigma. Adigma. Adigma. Um so a few dos and don'ts of uh Um so a few dos and don'ts of uh Um so a few dos and don'ts of uh distributing and exchanging soms. Please distributing and exchanging soms. Please distributing and exchanging soms. Please don't email them. Um this uh the don't email them. Um this uh the don't email them. Um this uh the documents are supposed to be read by documents are supposed to be read by documents are supposed to be read by machines. So put them in some place that machines. So put them in some place that machines. So put them in some place that machines can get them. And the same goes machines can get them. And the same goes machines can get them. And the same goes for uh when you have an NDA in place. for uh when you have an NDA in place. for uh when you have an NDA in place. It's um I mean it's transparency. So um It's um I mean it's transparency. So um It's um I mean it's transparency. So um sometimes NDAs make uh exchanging of sometimes NDAs make uh exchanging of sometimes NDAs make uh exchanging of transparency difficult. Um uh same for transparency difficult. Um uh same for transparency difficult. Um uh same for signing terms um of of of service before signing terms um of of of service before signing terms um of of of service before getting uh to see the information. Uh getting uh to see the information. Uh getting uh to see the information. Uh then what what would be encouraged? Um then what what would be encouraged? Um then what what would be encouraged? Um well whenever you have a distributed well whenever you have a distributed well whenever you have a distributed live artifact distribute the S1 with it. live artifact distribute the S1 with it. live artifact distribute the S1 with it. Uh and then ensure that everything can Uh and then ensure that everything can Uh and then ensure that everything can be accessed by standard protocols. uh be accessed by standard protocols. uh be accessed by standard protocols. uh and access. Sometimes you need to be a and access. Sometimes you need to be a and access. Sometimes you need to be a customer or whatever. It's fine. But customer or whatever. It's fine. But customer or whatever. It's fine. But once you have those credentials, don't once you have those credentials, don't once you have those credentials, don't put an like an excessive burden so that put an like an excessive burden so that put an like an excessive burden so that uh so if if a customer already has a uh so if if a customer already has a uh so if if a customer already has a relationship with you, make sure that relationship with you, make sure that relationship with you, make sure that the credentials they have are enough to the credentials they have are enough to the credentials they have are enough to uh for them to access the uh for them to access the uh for them to access the documents. All right. So, and then as a documents. All right. So, and then as a documents. All right. So, and then as a customer, you need to verify the customer, you need to verify the customer, you need to verify the artifacts that you're getting. Uh so how artifacts that you're getting. Uh so how artifacts that you're getting. Uh so how do you verify them? Um so in the case of do you verify them? Um so in the case of do you verify them? Um so in the case of the detach signatures we're going to the detach signatures we're going to the detach signatures we're going to look into into how to verify the S1 that look into into how to verify the S1 that look into into how to verify the S1 that we did. Uh so the verification that we did. Uh so the verification that we did. Uh so the verification that we're going to do here um so first first we're going to do here um so first first we're going to do here um so first first let me uh show you what I'm going to do. let me uh show you what I'm going to do. let me uh show you what I'm going to do. So this is going to use cosign the same So this is going to use cosign the same So this is going to use cosign the same tool from to verify uh the signatures uh tool from to verify uh the signatures uh tool from to verify uh the signatures uh in the certificate that we just in the certificate that we just in the certificate that we just produced. Uh, so I'm going to put the produced. Uh, so I'm going to put the produced. Uh, so I'm going to put the command here. Okay, so I run it and go and here. Okay, so I run it and go and here. Okay, so I run it and go and return. Okay, verification. Okay, now return. Okay, verification. Okay, now return. Okay, verification. Okay, now there are a few caveats on this and and there are a few caveats on this and and there are a few caveats on this and and you'll see this in the example pasted you'll see this in the example pasted you'll see this in the example pasted there. If you see here, I'm cheating a there. If you see here, I'm cheating a there. If you see here, I'm cheating a little bit because I'm passing an little bit because I'm passing an little bit because I'm passing an anything regular expression to both the anything regular expression to both the anything regular expression to both the identity um uh provider and the the identity um uh provider and the the identity um uh provider and the the identity itself. So inside of the of the identity itself. So inside of the of the identity itself. So inside of the of the certificate, if you got the certificate certificate, if you got the certificate certificate, if you got the certificate and analyze it with OpenSSL, uh then and analyze it with OpenSSL, uh then and analyze it with OpenSSL, uh then you'll see that six embeds in the you'll see that six embeds in the you'll see that six embeds in the certificate the identity of the person certificate the identity of the person certificate the identity of the person who signed uh the the um the the ESOM. who signed uh the the um the the ESOM. who signed uh the the um the the ESOM. Now when you verify, verifying is not Now when you verify, verifying is not Now when you verify, verifying is not enough. If you only verify the enough. If you only verify the enough. If you only verify the signatures, the only thing that you're signatures, the only thing that you're signatures, the only thing that you're getting is that the file was not getting is that the file was not getting is that the file was not altered. But the good thing about SixTor altered. But the good thing about SixTor altered. But the good thing about SixTor is that it embeds the identity of the is that it embeds the identity of the is that it embeds the identity of the signer. So you can know that the not signer. So you can know that the not signer. So you can know that the not only wasn't uh the file wasn't verified, only wasn't uh the file wasn't verified, only wasn't uh the file wasn't verified, wasn't modified, but it it's actually wasn't modified, but it it's actually wasn't modified, but it it's actually was actually signed by the person you're was actually signed by the person you're was actually signed by the person you're expecting to, but you need to specify expecting to, but you need to specify expecting to, but you need to specify that. So if you do this, you're not that. So if you do this, you're not that. So if you do this, you're not really uh taking advantage of that. Um really uh taking advantage of that. Um really uh taking advantage of that. Um the reason I put this here is because we the reason I put this here is because we the reason I put this here is because we needed copy paste instructions for the needed copy paste instructions for the needed copy paste instructions for the workshop. Uh so you would in this case I workshop. Uh so you would in this case I workshop. Uh so you would in this case I would need to specify GitHub and uh the would need to specify GitHub and uh the would need to specify GitHub and uh the identity of the account that we use to identity of the account that we use to identity of the account that we use to verify uh but well I mean you get the verify uh but well I mean you get the verify uh but well I mean you get the idea so you can toy around with the idea so you can toy around with the idea so you can toy around with the commands in the repos to to verify it. commands in the repos to to verify it. commands in the repos to to verify it. Um and then uh the other is well Um and then uh the other is well Um and then uh the other is well verifying the attestation. So verifying verifying the attestation. So verifying verifying the attestation. So verifying the at the station goes through the same the at the station goes through the same the at the station goes through the same uh it's more or less the same process as uh it's more or less the same process as uh it's more or less the same process as um verifying the um the um the um verifying the um the um the um verifying the um the um the signatures. So if we just verify the signatures. So if we just verify the signatures. So if we just verify the attestation by itself uh and we don't do attestation by itself uh and we don't do attestation by itself uh and we don't do the identity uh don't do the identity the identity uh don't do the identity the identity uh don't do the identity check then it's going to say okay it check then it's going to say okay it check then it's going to say okay it verifies because of the contents of the verifies because of the contents of the verifies because of the contents of the file check out. Um but then it doesn't file check out. Um but then it doesn't file check out. Um but then it doesn't it doesn't really give you a lot. Uh so it doesn't really give you a lot. Uh so it doesn't really give you a lot. Uh so when you verify as a consumer you need when you verify as a consumer you need when you verify as a consumer you need to know who should be signing that and to know who should be signing that and to know who should be signing that and ensure that the identity matches and and ensure that the identity matches and and ensure that the identity matches and and you can also you can also you can also um like in in more or less um try to see um like in in more or less um try to see um like in in more or less um try to see inside of the station to understand what inside of the station to understand what inside of the station to understand what you have in there. Uh so you'll see that you have in there. Uh so you'll see that you have in there. Uh so you'll see that okay so what is what's inside the at the okay so what is what's inside the at the okay so what is what's inside the at the station? Okay, a cyclone DX and it's station? Okay, a cyclone DX and it's station? Okay, a cyclone DX and it's wrapped in a sixer bundle. Okay, nice. wrapped in a sixer bundle. Okay, nice. wrapped in a sixer bundle. Okay, nice. And then finally, can you um how how can And then finally, can you um how how can And then finally, can you um how how can you get back your sbomb from the um from you get back your sbomb from the um from you get back your sbomb from the um from the from the bundle? Well, you you need the from the bundle? Well, you you need the from the bundle? Well, you you need to unwrap a whole lot of of JSON uh to unwrap a whole lot of of JSON uh to unwrap a whole lot of of JSON uh which you can do by using jq and b 64 which you can do by using jq and b 64 which you can do by using jq and b 64 and other tricks. Uh but this um so this and other tricks. Uh but this um so this and other tricks. Uh but this um so this can so this if you use the same tool can so this if you use the same tool can so this if you use the same tool extract statement it'll give it out the extract statement it'll give it out the extract statement it'll give it out the the individual layers if you want. So the individual layers if you want. So the individual layers if you want. So you can see here that inside of it is you can see here that inside of it is you can see here that inside of it is the sbomb that we generated and it's um the sbomb that we generated and it's um the sbomb that we generated and it's um and you can see here the subject and the and you can see here the subject and the and you can see here the subject and the the hashes of the of the tarble that we the hashes of the of the tarble that we the hashes of the of the tarble that we used as as a subject to verify and yeah used as as a subject to verify and yeah used as as a subject to verify and yeah so next up um retrieving and storing so next up um retrieving and storing so next up um retrieving and storing them. them. them. Thanks Marco. So I think you know we we Thanks Marco. So I think you know we we Thanks Marco. So I think you know we we got a lot of information about how to got a lot of information about how to got a lot of information about how to verify these how do we make sure the verify these how do we make sure the verify these how do we make sure the integrity of them is complete. Next, integrity of them is complete. Next, integrity of them is complete. Next, let's talk a little bit about how we let's talk a little bit about how we let's talk a little bit about how we want to retrieve these from places and want to retrieve these from places and want to retrieve these from places and push them someplace else. Right? We're push them someplace else. Right? We're push them someplace else. Right? We're talk a lot about redistribution, right? talk a lot about redistribution, right? talk a lot about redistribution, right? So, common question I get is that's So, common question I get is that's So, common question I get is that's great. You need an SBO. How do I great. You need an SBO. How do I great. You need an SBO. How do I actually get it? Right? So, that's what actually get it? Right? So, that's what actually get it? Right? So, that's what bombl within the open ss open sf is bombl within the open ss open sf is bombl within the open ss open sf is trying to solve. It does kind of two trying to solve. It does kind of two trying to solve. It does kind of two things really well. It allows you to things really well. It allows you to things really well. It allows you to fetch sbombs in a tree structure. So it fetch sbombs in a tree structure. So it fetch sbombs in a tree structure. So it will recursively follow along internal will recursively follow along internal will recursively follow along internal references in an SSBOM and then it will references in an SSBOM and then it will references in an SSBOM and then it will allow you to push that entire tree allow you to push that entire tree allow you to push that entire tree someplace someplace someplace else. Um so again thinking about the else. Um so again thinking about the else. Um so again thinking about the idea of like say my employer say an F-35 idea of like say my employer say an F-35 idea of like say my employer say an F-35 what is an F an Fbomb an SBOM for the what is an F an Fbomb an SBOM for the what is an F an Fbomb an SBOM for the F-35 look like? It's going to be a ton F-35 look like? It's going to be a ton F-35 look like? It's going to be a ton of individual suppliers providing their of individual suppliers providing their of individual suppliers providing their individual Sbombs. I need a way to individual Sbombs. I need a way to individual Sbombs. I need a way to collect those and I need a way to build collect those and I need a way to build collect those and I need a way to build some representation of a system and then some representation of a system and then some representation of a system and then I need to be able to push that sbomb I need to be able to push that sbomb I need to be able to push that sbomb someplace else. So I'm just going to someplace else. So I'm just going to someplace else. So I'm just going to jump in for the sake of time directly jump in for the sake of time directly jump in for the sake of time directly into into into um environment here. And so what we're um environment here. And so what we're um environment here. And so what we're going to do is we're going to fetch from going to do is we're going to fetch from going to do is we're going to fetch from a URL. And you'll notice here I'm just a URL. And you'll notice here I'm just a URL. And you'll notice here I'm just passing along a passing along a passing along a single single single single single single um URL and it goes out and it actually um URL and it goes out and it actually um URL and it goes out and it actually ends up fetching two different ends up fetching two different ends up fetching two different sbombs. One in cyclx and one in sbombs. One in cyclx and one in sbombs. One in cyclx and one in spdx. Mind blown, right? Maybe not. Um but the idea here, right? Maybe not. Um but the idea here, right? Maybe not. Um but the idea here, right, is like if how do you represent a right, is like if how do you represent a right, is like if how do you represent a helm chart? You may have an sbomb that helm chart? You may have an sbomb that helm chart? You may have an sbomb that represents the top level helm chart and represents the top level helm chart and represents the top level helm chart and you may need to reference an sbomb say you may need to reference an sbomb say you may need to reference an sbomb say in dockerhub for an official image. How in dockerhub for an official image. How in dockerhub for an official image. How do you show connectivity between these do you show connectivity between these do you show connectivity between these different locations with these different different locations with these different different locations with these different sbombs? That's what bombl is trying to sbombs? That's what bombl is trying to sbombs? That's what bombl is trying to do. So we can go ahead and just like do. So we can go ahead and just like do. So we can go ahead and just like list the bombs in the in the local list the bombs in the in the local list the bombs in the in the local representation representation representation here. It'll tell us that we have these here. It'll tell us that we have these here. It'll tell us that we have these two bombs. I can do fun things two bombs. I can do fun things two bombs. I can do fun things like export this and run say into ripe. like export this and run say into ripe. like export this and run say into ripe. So I'm gonna do bomb So I'm gonna do bomb So I'm gonna do bomb export and represents it in uh cycl dx. export and represents it in uh cycl dx. export and represents it in uh cycl dx. I can do the same thing and just tell it I can do the same thing and just tell it I can do the same thing and just tell it df df df spdx and using protobomb as the spdx and using protobomb as the spdx and using protobomb as the foundational uh library underneath this foundational uh library underneath this foundational uh library underneath this will then spit out the same bomb in the will then spit out the same bomb in the will then spit out the same bomb in the different format. So I was able to grab different format. So I was able to grab different format. So I was able to grab a cyclone DXS bomb. It happened to a cyclone DXS bomb. It happened to a cyclone DXS bomb. It happened to download internally referenced other download internally referenced other download internally referenced other bombs based on a single bombs based on a single bombs based on a single component output in a different format. You can now I could do the same thing You can now I could do the same thing You can now I could do the same thing for the other for the other for the other Sbomb and I could do the same thing Sbomb and I could do the same thing Sbomb and I could do the same thing converting that SPDX1 to a Cycl DX. So, converting that SPDX1 to a Cycl DX. So, converting that SPDX1 to a Cycl DX. So, hey, we've downloaded some bombs. We hey, we've downloaded some bombs. We hey, we've downloaded some bombs. We have them in our internal have them in our internal have them in our internal representation. Now, I want to push them representation. Now, I want to push them representation. Now, I want to push them someplace. So, in this example, we someplace. So, in this example, we someplace. So, in this example, we actually have um little OCI registry actually have um little OCI registry actually have um little OCI registry running. Uh, and it automatically is running. Uh, and it automatically is running. Uh, and it automatically is pushed like the hello uh pushed like the hello uh pushed like the hello uh bombl uh 0.0.0 version. Let's go ahead bombl uh 0.0.0 version. Let's go ahead bombl uh 0.0.0 version. Let's go ahead and we've grabbed these sbombs from a and we've grabbed these sbombs from a and we've grabbed these sbombs from a URL. Let's turn around and push them to URL. Let's turn around and push them to URL. Let's turn around and push them to the OCI the OCI the OCI registry. Uh you can do this in the in registry. Uh you can do this in the in registry. Uh you can do this in the in this little environment. So we got to this little environment. So we got to this little environment. So we got to get the URL and and whatnot. But can get the URL and and whatnot. But can get the URL and and whatnot. But can then turn around and push that bomb to then turn around and push that bomb to then turn around and push that bomb to that OCI that OCI that OCI registry. And if we take a look, it will registry. And if we take a look, it will registry. And if we take a look, it will now have now have now have uh should have updated since I pushed it. That's not what I wanted. Well, it it. That's not what I wanted. Well, it it. That's not what I wanted. Well, it should have pushed it. It says that it should have pushed it. It says that it should have pushed it. It says that it pushed it. I'm going to say that it did pushed it. I'm going to say that it did pushed it. I'm going to say that it did push push push it. Um, but that again that that it. Um, but that again that that it. Um, but that again that that movement, right? So, we we took bombs movement, right? So, we we took bombs movement, right? So, we we took bombs from one place, we put them someplace from one place, we put them someplace from one place, we put them someplace else. Today it focuses more on GitHub, else. Today it focuses more on GitHub, else. Today it focuses more on GitHub, GitLab, URLs, GitLab, URLs, GitLab, URLs, um, OCI, and we want to expand this um, OCI, and we want to expand this um, OCI, and we want to expand this tooling into things like say commercial tooling into things like say commercial tooling into things like say commercial offerings like manifest, um, or offerings like manifest, um, or offerings like manifest, um, or dependency track. So again, I have a dependency track. So again, I have a dependency track. So again, I have a whole bunch of bombs. I need to get into whole bunch of bombs. I need to get into whole bunch of bombs. I need to get into dependency track. How do I actually move dependency track. How do I actually move dependency track. How do I actually move a whole bunch of sbombs into dependency a whole bunch of sbombs into dependency a whole bunch of sbombs into dependency track? How do I move them into say a track? How do I move them into say a track? How do I move them into say a commercial registry? How do I give them commercial registry? How do I give them commercial registry? How do I give them to my customer where they're not going to my customer where they're not going to my customer where they're not going and clicking individual sbombs from a and clicking individual sbombs from a and clicking individual sbombs from a website? That's what bombtail is trying website? That's what bombtail is trying website? That's what bombtail is trying to to to solve. And with that, I'm going to skip solve. And with that, I'm going to skip solve. And with that, I'm going to skip ahead into operations to give Mike the ahead into operations to give Mike the ahead into operations to give Mike the last 25 minutes. All right. Um, so now that we learned how you've Um, so now that we learned how you've Um, so now that we learned how you've been, you know, how you can generate been, you know, how you can generate been, you know, how you can generate sbombs, enrich them, do all sorts of sbombs, enrich them, do all sorts of sbombs, enrich them, do all sorts of stuff with them, and then share them, stuff with them, and then share them, stuff with them, and then share them, associate identities with who generated associate identities with who generated associate identities with who generated those sbombs or injected information in those sbombs or injected information in those sbombs or injected information in those sbombs. Uh, you know, what do I do those sbombs. Uh, you know, what do I do those sbombs. Uh, you know, what do I do with them? Um, and I know that, you with them? Um, and I know that, you with them? Um, and I know that, you know, one of the challenges we've had know, one of the challenges we've had know, one of the challenges we've had for a while is right now sbombs are for a while is right now sbombs are for a while is right now sbombs are mostly being used for compliance. And mostly being used for compliance. And mostly being used for compliance. And that's one of the reasons why I think that's one of the reasons why I think that's one of the reasons why I think folks like Ian get an ESBOM that has folks like Ian get an ESBOM that has folks like Ian get an ESBOM that has information like Acme, you know, app or information like Acme, you know, app or information like Acme, you know, app or whatever in there or like insert, you whatever in there or like insert, you whatever in there or like insert, you know, commercial name here. Um, is know, commercial name here. Um, is know, commercial name here. Um, is because folks are just sort of throwing because folks are just sort of throwing because folks are just sort of throwing them in a bucket somewhere. They're them in a bucket somewhere. They're them in a bucket somewhere. They're throwing them in a share. They're throwing them in a share. They're throwing them in a share. They're emailing them and just expecting nobody emailing them and just expecting nobody emailing them and just expecting nobody to actually be doing anything with them. to actually be doing anything with them. to actually be doing anything with them. But, um, you know, hey, uh, they But, um, you know, hey, uh, they But, um, you know, hey, uh, they actually do have a lot of great uses. actually do have a lot of great uses. actually do have a lot of great uses. And let's kind of go through what some And let's kind of go through what some And let's kind of go through what some of those things uh what you could of those things uh what you could of those things uh what you could actually be doing with them especially actually be doing with them especially actually be doing with them especially with regards to with regards to with regards to vulnerabilities. Um so let's first talk vulnerabilities. Um so let's first talk vulnerabilities. Um so let's first talk about sort of operational maturity. So about sort of operational maturity. So about sort of operational maturity. So don't uh you know for as much as I like don't uh you know for as much as I like don't uh you know for as much as I like tools like for example guac which we'll tools like for example guac which we'll tools like for example guac which we'll learn about a little bit or even tools learn about a little bit or even tools learn about a little bit or even tools like dependency track if you just have a like dependency track if you just have a like dependency track if you just have a handful of sbombs you don't need to go handful of sbombs you don't need to go handful of sbombs you don't need to go and spin up a bunch of different and spin up a bunch of different and spin up a bunch of different commercial tools and do a whole bunch of commercial tools and do a whole bunch of commercial tools and do a whole bunch of stuff for that. You can use some of the stuff for that. You can use some of the stuff for that. You can use some of the tools out there like you know um you tools out there like you know um you tools out there like you know um you know if you're just trying to pull down know if you're just trying to pull down know if you're just trying to pull down those sbombs you can use curl for a lot those sbombs you can use curl for a lot those sbombs you can use curl for a lot of that you can use bombctl and and so of that you can use bombctl and and so of that you can use bombctl and and so on you don't necessarily need to use um on you don't necessarily need to use um on you don't necessarily need to use um the guac sort of ingestment ingestion the guac sort of ingestment ingestion the guac sort of ingestment ingestion system and then uh you can also you know system and then uh you can also you know system and then uh you can also you know individually scan various sbombs for individually scan various sbombs for individually scan various sbombs for what's the current state of what's the current state of what's the current state of vulnerabilities using tools like gripe vulnerabilities using tools like gripe vulnerabilities using tools like gripe trivia or ovc scanner if you have a few trivia or ovc scanner if you have a few trivia or ovc scanner if you have a few more sbombs right um and you're trying more sbombs right um and you're trying more sbombs right um and you're trying to compare between them you start to use to compare between them you start to use to compare between them you start to use in-memory tools once again another open in-memory tools once again another open in-memory tools once again another open source tool up there duct DB it's all in source tool up there duct DB it's all in source tool up there duct DB it's all in memory I can load in a 100 sbombs and memory I can load in a 100 sbombs and memory I can load in a 100 sbombs and start playing around with them and then start playing around with them and then start playing around with them and then sure if you have a lot of sbombs look at sure if you have a lot of sbombs look at sure if you have a lot of sbombs look at tools like guac look at tools like tools like guac look at tools like tools like guac look at tools like dependency track and other sort of you dependency track and other sort of you dependency track and other sort of you know look at vendor tools for know look at vendor tools for know look at vendor tools for example and then what are the outcomes example and then what are the outcomes example and then what are the outcomes we want to get out of these sbombs that we want to get out of these sbombs that we want to get out of these sbombs that we're sort of um using right well one of we're sort of um using right well one of we're sort of um using right well one of the things right is if I have more than the things right is if I have more than the things right is if I have more than one sbomb, right? If I just have one one sbomb, right? If I just have one one sbomb, right? If I just have one sbomb, I can look at what are the sbomb, I can look at what are the sbomb, I can look at what are the vulnerabilities, maybe things like vulnerabilities, maybe things like vulnerabilities, maybe things like license risks, but hey, for us, it's all license risks, but hey, for us, it's all license risks, but hey, for us, it's all about vulnerabilities. Um, we can about vulnerabilities. Um, we can about vulnerabilities. Um, we can determine what changed between two determine what changed between two determine what changed between two versions of the same software. It could versions of the same software. It could versions of the same software. It could be vendor software, it could be open be vendor software, it could be open be vendor software, it could be open source software, it could be software we source software, it could be software we source software, it could be software we created ourselves. Uh, and so what created ourselves. Uh, and so what created ourselves. Uh, and so what changed between those two versions? Did changed between those two versions? Did changed between those two versions? Did we, you know, if I scan vulnerabilities we, you know, if I scan vulnerabilities we, you know, if I scan vulnerabilities in one version and I scan in one version and I scan in one version and I scan vulnerabilities in the other version, vulnerabilities in the other version, vulnerabilities in the other version, what got fixed? Or maybe what didn't get what got fixed? Or maybe what didn't get what got fixed? Or maybe what didn't get fixed? What did I inadvertently fixed? What did I inadvertently fixed? What did I inadvertently introduce? introduce? introduce? Um, and then also over time, right, you Um, and then also over time, right, you Um, and then also over time, right, you know, vulnerabilities are reported and know, vulnerabilities are reported and know, vulnerabilities are reported and discovered. Uh, hey, I ran a scan discovered. Uh, hey, I ran a scan discovered. Uh, hey, I ran a scan against the Sbomb yesterday, no against the Sbomb yesterday, no against the Sbomb yesterday, no vulnerabilities. Today, vulnerability vulnerabilities. Today, vulnerability vulnerabilities. Today, vulnerability was discovered. Uh, it was disclosed, was discovered. Uh, it was disclosed, was discovered. Uh, it was disclosed, it's out there, and now I can run that it's out there, and now I can run that it's out there, and now I can run that scan a second time and be able to see, scan a second time and be able to see, scan a second time and be able to see, oh no, uh, a vulnerability was was oh no, uh, a vulnerability was was oh no, uh, a vulnerability was was introduced. And then that helps you also introduced. And then that helps you also introduced. And then that helps you also understand, hey, organizational risks. understand, hey, organizational risks. understand, hey, organizational risks. So am I using 12 different versions of So am I using 12 different versions of So am I using 12 different versions of the same log for J right and that the same log for J right and that the same log for J right and that actually all of them are vulnerable or actually all of them are vulnerable or actually all of them are vulnerable or half of them are vulnerable um what half of them are vulnerable um what half of them are vulnerable um what impact does a risk actually have and impact does a risk actually have and impact does a risk actually have and then you know again what risks things then you know again what risks things then you know again what risks things like vulnerabilities licenses and then like vulnerabilities licenses and then like vulnerabilities licenses and then also just version and dependency also just version and dependency also just version and dependency sprawl so we won't have enough time sprawl so we won't have enough time sprawl so we won't have enough time today to like really go into guac today to like really go into guac today to like really go into guac because again also uh guac will not run because again also uh guac will not run because again also uh guac will not run in git pod quite easily because it's a in git pod quite easily because it's a in git pod quite easily because it's a whole database and everything else. But whole database and everything else. But whole database and everything else. But if folks want to just um you know, if folks want to just um you know, if folks want to just um you know, here's the documentation on guac and you here's the documentation on guac and you here's the documentation on guac and you can kind of use that to kind of follow can kind of use that to kind of follow can kind of use that to kind of follow along at your leisure. There's a there's along at your leisure. There's a there's along at your leisure. There's a there's a um a Helm chart and and and a docker a um a Helm chart and and and a docker a um a Helm chart and and and a docker compos file for for that sort of compos file for for that sort of compos file for for that sort of stuff. All right. Um so as we kind of stuff. All right. Um so as we kind of stuff. All right. Um so as we kind of mentioned, you know, as was mentioned mentioned, you know, as was mentioned mentioned, you know, as was mentioned earlier, there's really no current earlier, there's really no current earlier, there's really no current standard for exchanging sbombs. There is standard for exchanging sbombs. There is standard for exchanging sbombs. There is the transparency exchange API that is the transparency exchange API that is the transparency exchange API that is being worked on as right now, but being worked on as right now, but being worked on as right now, but there's a lot of different places and there's a lot of different places and there's a lot of different places and some of those include things like being some of those include things like being some of those include things like being sent via email, which please please sent via email, which please please sent via email, which please please don't do that. It's maybe only don't do that. It's maybe only don't do that. It's maybe only marginally better than the other one marginally better than the other one marginally better than the other one which which which is told over the phone which is actually is told over the phone which is actually is told over the phone which is actually a a a approved version approved way of a a a approved version approved way of a a a approved version approved way of of exchanging sbombs. Um but a common of exchanging sbombs. Um but a common of exchanging sbombs. Um but a common way uh common ways are you know GitHub way uh common ways are you know GitHub way uh common ways are you know GitHub releases OCI some package managers like releases OCI some package managers like releases OCI some package managers like npm will support it as well and so hey npm will support it as well and so hey npm will support it as well and so hey just use curl like you can just download just use curl like you can just download just use curl like you can just download it you can just download the sbombs it you can just download the sbombs it you can just download the sbombs again this is for open source if you again this is for open source if you again this is for open source if you have vendors they'll give you usually an have vendors they'll give you usually an have vendors they'll give you usually an API or they'll send it through some API or they'll send it through some API or they'll send it through some other mechanism other mechanism other mechanism uh um the same uh um the same uh um the same uh so this so next up so once you've so this so next up so once you've so this so next up so once you've collected those sb bombs, you then want collected those sb bombs, you then want collected those sb bombs, you then want to optionally I would say ingest them to optionally I would say ingest them to optionally I would say ingest them depending on again how many sbombs you depending on again how many sbombs you depending on again how many sbombs you have. If you have uh you know again just have. If you have uh you know again just have. If you have uh you know again just a handful of sbombs, you could just a handful of sbombs, you could just a handful of sbombs, you could just collect them locally in a bucket and collect them locally in a bucket and collect them locally in a bucket and then run scans against the sbombs that then run scans against the sbombs that then run scans against the sbombs that are there. Uh but if you do have a lot are there. Uh but if you do have a lot are there. Uh but if you do have a lot of sbombs, you can go in and um actually of sbombs, you can go in and um actually of sbombs, you can go in and um actually uh uh ingest a lot of those uh into uh uh ingest a lot of those uh into uh uh ingest a lot of those uh into something like a database like a guac, something like a database like a guac, something like a database like a guac, like a dependency track or another, you like a dependency track or another, you like a dependency track or another, you know, uh know, uh know, uh solution. And so what's great about solution. And so what's great about solution. And so what's great about tools like GU is you can actually track tools like GU is you can actually track tools like GU is you can actually track changes over time. So you're not just changes over time. So you're not just changes over time. So you're not just looking at an SBOM as a snapshot, right? looking at an SBOM as a snapshot, right? looking at an SBOM as a snapshot, right? You're looking at, hey, yesterday I I I You're looking at, hey, yesterday I I I You're looking at, hey, yesterday I I I had version one. uh two weeks later I had version one. uh two weeks later I had version one. uh two weeks later I introduced version two. I generated two introduced version two. I generated two introduced version two. I generated two different sbombs. I can compare between different sbombs. I can compare between different sbombs. I can compare between them them them uh and and and so on. And so for example uh and and and so on. And so for example uh and and and so on. And so for example with guac you can kind of uh you can with guac you can kind of uh you can with guac you can kind of uh you can ingest all all of that in ince you've ingest all all of that in ince you've ingest all all of that in ince you've sort of either ingested or otherwise sort of either ingested or otherwise sort of either ingested or otherwise collected collected collected sbombs you want to be able to correlate sbombs you want to be able to correlate sbombs you want to be able to correlate them with additional data. So similar to them with additional data. So similar to them with additional data. So similar to sort of sbomb enrichment but it's it is sort of sbomb enrichment but it's it is sort of sbomb enrichment but it's it is different is as opposed to sort of different is as opposed to sort of different is as opposed to sort of saying hey at the moment that I am like saying hey at the moment that I am like saying hey at the moment that I am like looking at this sbomb here's all this looking at this sbomb here's all this looking at this sbomb here's all this data that I'm able to pull in you can data that I'm able to pull in you can data that I'm able to pull in you can look at uh a database like a dependency look at uh a database like a dependency look at uh a database like a dependency track like a guac to actually pull tons track like a guac to actually pull tons track like a guac to actually pull tons of additional metadata about the supply of additional metadata about the supply of additional metadata about the supply chain um for stuff like vulnerability chain um for stuff like vulnerability chain um for stuff like vulnerability management right so hey if I'm ingesting management right so hey if I'm ingesting management right so hey if I'm ingesting um uh lots of different sbombs I can um uh lots of different sbombs I can um uh lots of different sbombs I can also uh go in and and correlate it with also uh go in and and correlate it with also uh go in and and correlate it with additional sort of vulnerability additional sort of vulnerability additional sort of vulnerability information. So in this case uh for information. So in this case uh for information. So in this case uh for folks who are not super familiar there's folks who are not super familiar there's folks who are not super familiar there's an open source uh project that comes an open source uh project that comes an open source uh project that comes from Google called OSV scanner which is from Google called OSV scanner which is from Google called OSV scanner which is part of um it utilizes the OSV database part of um it utilizes the OSV database part of um it utilizes the OSV database for folks who are familiar with that. for folks who are familiar with that. for folks who are familiar with that. It's essentially just a database that It's essentially just a database that It's essentially just a database that that um aggregates like GitHub service that um aggregates like GitHub service that um aggregates like GitHub service advisories, various other package advisories, various other package advisories, various other package manager service advisories, pulls them manager service advisories, pulls them manager service advisories, pulls them all in to all in to all in to um and uh pulls them all into sort of um and uh pulls them all into sort of um and uh pulls them all into sort of one um database that uses the sort of one um database that uses the sort of one um database that uses the sort of OSV schema, which is is a nice sort of OSV schema, which is is a nice sort of OSV schema, which is is a nice sort of JSON schema for for um vulnerabilities. JSON schema for for um vulnerabilities. JSON schema for for um vulnerabilities. And you can go in and run like a scan And you can go in and run like a scan And you can go in and run like a scan against an SSBOM um and and essentially against an SSBOM um and and essentially against an SSBOM um and and essentially enrich uh the the data um uh sorry you enrich uh the the data um uh sorry you enrich uh the the data um uh sorry you can enrich sort of the information that can enrich sort of the information that can enrich sort of the information that you're getting from sbombs um and again you're getting from sbombs um and again you're getting from sbombs um and again this is super useful if you are this is super useful if you are this is super useful if you are integrating it with other sort of um integrating it with other sort of um integrating it with other sort of um runtime analysis tools and and all those runtime analysis tools and and all those runtime analysis tools and and all those sorts of things. So for example in the sorts of things. So for example in the sorts of things. So for example in the previous sorry in the previous example previous sorry in the previous example previous sorry in the previous example with guac you can do that with a couple with guac you can do that with a couple with guac you can do that with a couple of different flags um when you're of different flags um when you're of different flags um when you're actually ingesting the uh sbombs like actually ingesting the uh sbombs like actually ingesting the uh sbombs like you can do add v non-ingest which itself you can do add v non-ingest which itself you can do add v non-ingest which itself will actually call out to osv um to do will actually call out to osv um to do will actually call out to osv um to do that uh it also has the add eol uningest that uh it also has the add eol uningest that uh it also has the add eol uningest flag which will look at um end of flag which will look at um end of flag which will look at um end of life.date date uh you know uh as well as life.date date uh you know uh as well as life.date date uh you know uh as well as a couple other things that we're a couple other things that we're a couple other things that we're exploring in the open source and then exploring in the open source and then exploring in the open source and then also add license on ingest is um it will also add license on ingest is um it will also add license on ingest is um it will both uh uh look at and potentially both uh uh look at and potentially both uh uh look at and potentially correct licenses. So there's an OSI correct licenses. So there's an OSI correct licenses. So there's an OSI project um which is the open source project um which is the open source project um which is the open source initiative. Uh there's an OSI project initiative. Uh there's an OSI project initiative. Uh there's an OSI project called Clearly Defined which um has a called Clearly Defined which um has a called Clearly Defined which um has a bunch of lawyers actually actively bunch of lawyers actually actively bunch of lawyers actually actively looking at various different open source looking at various different open source looking at various different open source projects and traversing their projects and traversing their projects and traversing their dependencies to better understand hey dependencies to better understand hey dependencies to better understand hey this thing claims to be um MIT licensed this thing claims to be um MIT licensed this thing claims to be um MIT licensed but hey it relies on something that's but hey it relies on something that's but hey it relies on something that's AGPL that's a problem. It's that's AGPL that's a problem. It's that's AGPL that's a problem. It's that's actually not the right license. And so actually not the right license. And so actually not the right license. And so uh there's some stuff there as well. uh there's some stuff there as well. uh there's some stuff there as well. Um then you know hey uh once you've sort Um then you know hey uh once you've sort Um then you know hey uh once you've sort of correlated all some of this data what of correlated all some of this data what of correlated all some of this data what can you begin to start doing here with can you begin to start doing here with can you begin to start doing here with it? Um so you can use something like it? Um so you can use something like it? Um so you can use something like duct DB again if you have a handful of duct DB again if you have a handful of duct DB again if you have a handful of sbombs you know again not a ton but if sbombs you know again not a ton but if sbombs you know again not a ton but if you have a handful of sbombs you can you have a handful of sbombs you can you have a handful of sbombs you can some use something like duct db to some use something like duct db to some use something like duct db to create in-memory tables of those sbombs create in-memory tables of those sbombs create in-memory tables of those sbombs and it's very simple to sort of do that and it's very simple to sort of do that and it's very simple to sort of do that where you know um in this particular where you know um in this particular where you know um in this particular case uh for those who are not super case uh for those who are not super case uh for those who are not super familiar ductb can you could just sort familiar ductb can you could just sort familiar ductb can you could just sort of give it JSON and it'll let you just of give it JSON and it'll let you just of give it JSON and it'll let you just sort of run uh SQL against that sort of run uh SQL against that sort of run uh SQL against that JSON and um it can auto detect and sort JSON and um it can auto detect and sort JSON and um it can auto detect and sort of generate uh in-memory tables out of of generate uh in-memory tables out of of generate uh in-memory tables out of that. And then here we're just sort of that. And then here we're just sort of that. And then here we're just sort of selecting what are the distinct packages selecting what are the distinct packages selecting what are the distinct packages against all the sort of sbombs in that against all the sort of sbombs in that against all the sort of sbombs in that git pod. Um and you can kind of get just git pod. Um and you can kind of get just git pod. Um and you can kind of get just a list of the unique packages for a list of the unique packages for a list of the unique packages for example. So hey um without duplicates example. So hey um without duplicates example. So hey um without duplicates what are the unique packages across all sbombs and then sbombs and then sbombs and then um I so so then like for for example um I so so then like for for example um I so so then like for for example with guac you could also do things like with guac you could also do things like with guac you could also do things like right since I'm ingesting all this data right since I'm ingesting all this data right since I'm ingesting all this data uh I've sorry I've collected all these uh I've sorry I've collected all these uh I've sorry I've collected all these sbombs I've ingested them into guac I sbombs I've ingested them into guac I sbombs I've ingested them into guac I then correlated all this information then correlated all this information then correlated all this information with eol information with vulnerability with eol information with vulnerability with eol information with vulnerability information and so on I can then information and so on I can then information and so on I can then actually ask questions of my supply actually ask questions of my supply actually ask questions of my supply chain about what do I know right this chain about what do I know right this chain about what do I know right this second about all the software in my team second about all the software in my team second about all the software in my team in my department perhaps across my in my department perhaps across my in my department perhaps across my entire organization right I can ask entire organization right I can ask entire organization right I can ask questions like give it a pearl right a questions like give it a pearl right a questions like give it a pearl right a package URL guac one query v pearl right package URL guac one query v pearl right package URL guac one query v pearl right which will just get list me all known which will just get list me all known which will just get list me all known vulnerabilities that were ingested um vulnerabilities that were ingested um vulnerabilities that were ingested um and again guac is something that will and again guac is something that will and again guac is something that will over time continually what they call over time continually what they call over time continually what they call like certify where we'll just go out and like certify where we'll just go out and like certify where we'll just go out and once every hour or so pull all known once every hour or so pull all known once every hour or so pull all known dependency sorry pull all known dependency sorry pull all known dependency sorry pull all known vulnerabilities against all the packages vulnerabilities against all the packages vulnerabilities against all the packages we have and constantly update uh uh we have and constantly update uh uh we have and constantly update uh uh based on based on based on that and um you know we can also do that and um you know we can also do that and um you know we can also do stuff about hey what do we just know stuff about hey what do we just know stuff about hey what do we just know about this package what does this about this package what does this about this package what does this licenses have you know and and licenses have you know and and licenses have you know and and information like that and this helps information like that and this helps information like that and this helps answer questions like did I actually fix answer questions like did I actually fix answer questions like did I actually fix the vulnerability right I I updated um the vulnerability right I I updated um the vulnerability right I I updated um some stuff and and I put I updated a some stuff and and I put I updated a some stuff and and I put I updated a bunch of things and bunch of things and bunch of things and um uh you know released a new version. um uh you know released a new version. um uh you know released a new version. Did that actually fix the vulnerability? Did that actually fix the vulnerability? Did that actually fix the vulnerability? And then probably more importantly for a And then probably more importantly for a And then probably more importantly for a lot of us who are often dealing with lot of us who are often dealing with lot of us who are often dealing with vulnerabilities at like scale is is this vulnerabilities at like scale is is this vulnerabilities at like scale is is this something that impacts one tool that's something that impacts one tool that's something that impacts one tool that's in dev or is this something that that uh in dev or is this something that that uh in dev or is this something that that uh impacts maybe my entire organization? impacts maybe my entire organization? impacts maybe my entire organization? um which is of course uh can be pretty um which is of course uh can be pretty um which is of course uh can be pretty scary like is it the next log for J or scary like is it the next log for J or scary like is it the next log for J or is this something that hey yeah we is this something that hey yeah we is this something that hey yeah we should get to it when we get to it it's should get to it when we get to it it's should get to it when we get to it it's only in dev we haven't released it um so one of the other things you can do um so one of the other things you can do um so one of the other things you can do right is once you kind of have some of right is once you kind of have some of right is once you kind of have some of this information you can actually begin this information you can actually begin this information you can actually begin to run actions on this right you can go to run actions on this right you can go to run actions on this right you can go and use tools like OSV scanner you can and use tools like OSV scanner you can and use tools like OSV scanner you can use tools like mpm if you're like an npm use tools like mpm if you're like an npm use tools like mpm if you're like an npm product you project you can do npm M product you project you can do npm M product you project you can do npm M audit fix against stuff now that you audit fix against stuff now that you audit fix against stuff now that you have all this information about the have all this information about the have all this information about the vulnerabilities and everything else you vulnerabilities and everything else you vulnerabilities and everything else you know what to sort of prioritize know what to sort of prioritize know what to sort of prioritize regarding fixing um which again you know regarding fixing um which again you know regarding fixing um which again you know not everything is just as easy as you not everything is just as easy as you not everything is just as easy as you know if you're on GitHub using know if you're on GitHub using know if you're on GitHub using dependabot right sometimes you're like I dependabot right sometimes you're like I dependabot right sometimes you're like I need to prioritize because again these need to prioritize because again these need to prioritize because again these things could have impacts to uh features things could have impacts to uh features things could have impacts to uh features to to a lot of other to to a lot of other to to a lot of other things and so you want to be able to now things and so you want to be able to now things and so you want to be able to now that you've sort of analyzed that data that you've sort of analyzed that data that you've sort of analyzed that data you want to say okay what do I do about you want to say okay what do I do about you want to say okay what do I do about these vulnerabilities and and so on. these vulnerabilities and and so on. these vulnerabilities and and so on. Um now uh one of the things that guac Um now uh one of the things that guac Um now uh one of the things that guac can do right is guac you can actually do can do right is guac you can actually do can do right is guac you can actually do like a patch plan right because we have like a patch plan right because we have like a patch plan right because we have inside of guac essentially uh you know inside of guac essentially uh you know inside of guac essentially uh you know we have all this great information about we have all this great information about we have all this great information about the sbombs we're correlating it with the sbombs we're correlating it with the sbombs we're correlating it with things like the information from osv things like the information from osv things like the information from osv deps.dev dev etc. And then as you pull deps.dev dev etc. And then as you pull deps.dev dev etc. And then as you pull in more sbombs we can potentially even in more sbombs we can potentially even in more sbombs we can potentially even build out a bigger picture of your build out a bigger picture of your build out a bigger picture of your supply chain. So if it turns out you supply chain. So if it turns out you supply chain. So if it turns out you have as an example I have an sbomb for a have as an example I have an sbomb for a have as an example I have an sbomb for a container and that container contains container and that container contains container and that container contains acme app and then acme app we have an acme app and then acme app we have an acme app and then acme app we have an sbomb for acme app which itself has all sbomb for acme app which itself has all sbomb for acme app which itself has all of its dependencies. we can combine both of its dependencies. we can combine both of its dependencies. we can combine both of those in um guac to then build out a of those in um guac to then build out a of those in um guac to then build out a bigger sort of essentially connect those bigger sort of essentially connect those bigger sort of essentially connect those two graphs or connect those two trees. two graphs or connect those two trees. two graphs or connect those two trees. And that makes it very easy for us to And that makes it very easy for us to And that makes it very easy for us to then create like a patch plan of hey, in then create like a patch plan of hey, in then create like a patch plan of hey, in order for me to fix an issue in the um order for me to fix an issue in the um order for me to fix an issue in the um Acme app image, I need to first actually Acme app image, I need to first actually Acme app image, I need to first actually fix the Acme app binary first. Um and fix the Acme app binary first. Um and fix the Acme app binary first. Um and then once that's been fixed, I can then then once that's been fixed, I can then then once that's been fixed, I can then kind of uh do stuff up the chain, which kind of uh do stuff up the chain, which kind of uh do stuff up the chain, which is always I think one of the challenges is always I think one of the challenges is always I think one of the challenges with what we have a lot of times is, with what we have a lot of times is, with what we have a lot of times is, hey, I have a vulnerability. um it's hey, I have a vulnerability. um it's hey, I have a vulnerability. um it's somewhere deeply nested in a a somewhere deeply nested in a a somewhere deeply nested in a a transitive dependency, it's hard to sort transitive dependency, it's hard to sort transitive dependency, it's hard to sort of figure out. Um if you have sbombs of figure out. Um if you have sbombs of figure out. Um if you have sbombs that are relatively complete, relatively that are relatively complete, relatively that are relatively complete, relatively accurate, you can begin to sort of accurate, you can begin to sort of accurate, you can begin to sort of answer the question of okay, is this answer the question of okay, is this answer the question of okay, is this something I need just need to fix like something I need just need to fix like something I need just need to fix like do I just need to update my mpm sorry my do I just need to update my mpm sorry my do I just need to update my mpm sorry my package.json JSON for and then you know package.json JSON for and then you know package.json JSON for and then you know do an npm update or is this something do an npm update or is this something do an npm update or is this something that hey I need to actually go in update that hey I need to actually go in update that hey I need to actually go in update uh this binary and then update another uh this binary and then update another uh this binary and then update another binary and then update the base image binary and then update the base image binary and then update the base image and so on. Guac will help sort of answer and so on. Guac will help sort of answer and so on. Guac will help sort of answer some of those questions as as well. some of those questions as as well. some of those questions as as well. So some future work inside of um uh some So some future work inside of um uh some So some future work inside of um uh some of this uh that you could start to look of this uh that you could start to look of this uh that you could start to look at right is hey now you that you're at right is hey now you that you're at right is hey now you that you're actioning on some of this right right actioning on some of this right right actioning on some of this right right now a lot of the actions I was talking now a lot of the actions I was talking now a lot of the actions I was talking about would be manual right you are about would be manual right you are about would be manual right you are going out there and running these going out there and running these going out there and running these commands yourself but in the future commands yourself but in the future commands yourself but in the future right you can what you're able to do is right you can what you're able to do is right you can what you're able to do is um and we have this you know set up in a um and we have this you know set up in a um and we have this you know set up in a couple of different demos um and you couple of different demos um and you couple of different demos um and you know the QR code there is is for one of know the QR code there is is for one of know the QR code there is is for one of is you can look at policy as code, is you can look at policy as code, is you can look at policy as code, right? You could start to look at OPA right? You could start to look at OPA right? You could start to look at OPA for example and say, "Hey, if I start to for example and say, "Hey, if I start to for example and say, "Hey, if I start to see vulnerabilities show up in a couple see vulnerabilities show up in a couple see vulnerabilities show up in a couple of the areas that um um if I show so if of the areas that um um if I show so if of the areas that um um if I show so if vulnerabilities are showing up or if vulnerabilities are showing up or if vulnerabilities are showing up or if something is seen as being suspicious, I something is seen as being suspicious, I something is seen as being suspicious, I can actually block it from running in can actually block it from running in can actually block it from running in production, I can go in and say, "Hey, production, I can go in and say, "Hey, production, I can go in and say, "Hey, uh this policy triggered," which then uh this policy triggered," which then uh this policy triggered," which then triggers some automation which will triggers some automation which will triggers some automation which will automatically, let's say, remediate that automatically, let's say, remediate that automatically, let's say, remediate that issue. issue. issue. And um again that's up on on there's a And um again that's up on on there's a And um again that's up on on there's a demo of that up on YouTube uh for demo of that up on YouTube uh for demo of that up on YouTube uh for anybody who's interested anybody who's interested anybody who's interested there. And then also runtime there. And then also runtime there. And then also runtime correlation. So now hey uh I have a correlation. So now hey uh I have a correlation. So now hey uh I have a bunch of information about the bunch of information about the bunch of information about the vulnerabilities and my supply chain and vulnerabilities and my supply chain and vulnerabilities and my supply chain and all the source code and binaries I have all the source code and binaries I have all the source code and binaries I have but then what's running and what's but then what's running and what's but then what's running and what's running where. So for folks who are running where. So for folks who are running where. So for folks who are familiar with Kubernetes there's a tool familiar with Kubernetes there's a tool familiar with Kubernetes there's a tool called Cubescape which is underneath the called Cubescape which is underneath the called Cubescape which is underneath the CNCF. It's another open source project CNCF. It's another open source project CNCF. It's another open source project that looks at what's running inside of that looks at what's running inside of that looks at what's running inside of your um uh Kubernetes clusters and can your um uh Kubernetes clusters and can your um uh Kubernetes clusters and can you know um block issues, help remediate you know um block issues, help remediate you know um block issues, help remediate them. But one of the things that you them. But one of the things that you them. But one of the things that you could do with cubecape in addition to could do with cubecape in addition to could do with cubecape in addition to guac is you can actually um go and say guac is you can actually um go and say guac is you can actually um go and say hey this is what we know about the hey this is what we know about the hey this is what we know about the software just generally in our supply software just generally in our supply software just generally in our supply chain and then using runtime analysis chain and then using runtime analysis chain and then using runtime analysis you can actually and ebpf you can see you can actually and ebpf you can see you can actually and ebpf you can see whether or not the vulnerable packages whether or not the vulnerable packages whether or not the vulnerable packages are even loaded into memory and hey if are even loaded into memory and hey if are even loaded into memory and hey if they're not loaded into memory maybe you they're not loaded into memory maybe you they're not loaded into memory maybe you know you should still probably fix it know you should still probably fix it know you should still probably fix it but maybe it's not the most immediate but maybe it's not the most immediate but maybe it's not the most immediate thing to to to fix. Um that one the talk thing to to to fix. Um that one the talk thing to to to fix. Um that one the talk uh again the talk was recorded but uh again the talk was recorded but uh again the talk was recorded but CubeCon was just last week in in Europe. CubeCon was just last week in in Europe. CubeCon was just last week in in Europe. So that is going to take a little while So that is going to take a little while So that is going to take a little while to um upload usually within another week to um upload usually within another week to um upload usually within another week or so. Okay. Uh did you want to talk? Yeah. so. Okay. Uh did you want to talk? Yeah. so. Okay. Uh did you want to talk? Yeah. Oh sure. Hi John Kavanagh. Um so we've been Hi John Kavanagh. Um so we've been Hi John Kavanagh. Um so we've been working on the commercial side but I working on the commercial side but I working on the commercial side but I really want to applaud all your work on really want to applaud all your work on really want to applaud all your work on the open source side because I think the open source side because I think the open source side because I think this is a broader view and the pace that this is a broader view and the pace that this is a broader view and the pace that you're working at is you know on a you're working at is you know on a you're working at is you know on a contribution type of basis what we're contribution type of basis what we're contribution type of basis what we're seeing now is an increase in seeing now is an increase in seeing now is an increase in vulnerabilities and also an increase in vulnerabilities and also an increase in vulnerabilities and also an increase in complexity. So I think yeah you keep complexity. So I think yeah you keep complexity. So I think yeah you keep going on the open source side but I've going on the open source side but I've going on the open source side but I've done some research and one of the things done some research and one of the things done some research and one of the things is are we getting any of the ecosystems is are we getting any of the ecosystems is are we getting any of the ecosystems the GitHubs the gitlabs all of those to the GitHubs the gitlabs all of those to the GitHubs the gitlabs all of those to be at a common definition and operating be at a common definition and operating be at a common definition and operating standard. So um the answer is the work standard. So um the answer is the work standard. So um the answer is the work is being done. Um I saw him walk past a is being done. Um I saw him walk past a is being done. Um I saw him walk past a few times but there Michael Windsor is few times but there Michael Windsor is few times but there Michael Windsor is here from Alpha Omega which is an open here from Alpha Omega which is an open here from Alpha Omega which is an open SSF um that they call the directed fund. SSF um that they call the directed fund. SSF um that they call the directed fund. um essentially they're very much focused um essentially they're very much focused um essentially they're very much focused on sort of helping fund some of that. So on sort of helping fund some of that. So on sort of helping fund some of that. So the challenge here is uh a couple of the challenge here is uh a couple of the challenge here is uh a couple of there's a couple issues. One is there's a couple issues. One is there's a couple issues. One is um um um MPM they're a little bit easier. They're MPM they're a little bit easier. They're MPM they're a little bit easier. They're owned by GitHub which is owned by owned by GitHub which is owned by owned by GitHub which is owned by Microsoft Pippi completely nonprofit Microsoft Pippi completely nonprofit Microsoft Pippi completely nonprofit right so for them to kind of reach there right so for them to kind of reach there right so for them to kind of reach there that we need that money um to be able to that we need that money um to be able to that we need that money um to be able to sort of help them along. So when it sort of help them along. So when it sort of help them along. So when it comes to that sort of stuff, I think comes to that sort of stuff, I think comes to that sort of stuff, I think there's a lot of work there being done there's a lot of work there being done there's a lot of work there being done to uh to do that and in fact there is a to uh to do that and in fact there is a to uh to do that and in fact there is a bunch of initiatives within open SSF to bunch of initiatives within open SSF to bunch of initiatives within open SSF to do that. The challenge again is going to do that. The challenge again is going to do that. The challenge again is going to be um making sure that the funds are be um making sure that the funds are be um making sure that the funds are there so that they can hit that because there so that they can hit that because there so that they can hit that because hey we're all in open source, right? Um, hey we're all in open source, right? Um, hey we're all in open source, right? Um, the amount of times I've I've heard the amount of times I've I've heard the amount of times I've I've heard from, again, I'm also in commercial, so from, again, I'm also in commercial, so from, again, I'm also in commercial, so so I, you know, but but the amount of so I, you know, but but the amount of so I, you know, but but the amount of times I've heard somebody reach out to a times I've heard somebody reach out to a times I've heard somebody reach out to a maintainer and say, "You need to fix maintainer and say, "You need to fix maintainer and say, "You need to fix this." No, I don't. You don't pay me, so this." No, I don't. You don't pay me, so this." No, I don't. You don't pay me, so I don't need to fix anything. Um, and I I don't need to fix anything. Um, and I I don't need to fix anything. Um, and I think we're seeing that also in think we're seeing that also in think we're seeing that also in regulations as well, where we're seeing regulations as well, where we're seeing regulations as well, where we're seeing there's pushes to make folks like the there's pushes to make folks like the there's pushes to make folks like the LF, the Linux Foundation, OpenSSF, and LF, the Linux Foundation, OpenSSF, and LF, the Linux Foundation, OpenSSF, and other sort of nonprofits do a bit more, other sort of nonprofits do a bit more, other sort of nonprofits do a bit more, right? But as far as the sort of general right? But as far as the sort of general right? But as far as the sort of general like um you know John Smith who's you like um you know John Smith who's you like um you know John Smith who's you know sitting in a basement on the know sitting in a basement on the know sitting in a basement on the weekends he likes to hack on a library. weekends he likes to hack on a library. weekends he likes to hack on a library. It turns out that library is being used It turns out that library is being used It turns out that library is being used by multinational corporation in their by multinational corporation in their by multinational corporation in their product. And hey something just got product. And hey something just got product. And hey something just got exposed in it. That's multinational exposed in it. That's multinational exposed in it. That's multinational company's problem not not anybody company's problem not not anybody company's problem not not anybody else's. But with that said, there's else's. But with that said, there's else's. But with that said, there's definitely um interest among you know, definitely um interest among you know, definitely um interest among you know, nobody wants to be unsafe generally, but nobody wants to be unsafe generally, but nobody wants to be unsafe generally, but I think more people want to be able to I think more people want to be able to I think more people want to be able to say, hey, if we can incentivize the John say, hey, if we can incentivize the John say, hey, if we can incentivize the John Smith to sort of fix his thing or say, Smith to sort of fix his thing or say, Smith to sort of fix his thing or say, hey, maybe as a multinational hey, maybe as a multinational hey, maybe as a multinational corporation, I shouldn't be using uh a corporation, I shouldn't be using uh a corporation, I shouldn't be using uh a single maintainer project. He has a lot single maintainer project. He has a lot single maintainer project. He has a lot of awesome stuff in there, so he doesn't of awesome stuff in there, so he doesn't of awesome stuff in there, so he doesn't want my help. Great. what we're going to want my help. Great. what we're going to want my help. Great. what we're going to do is we're going to fork his project do is we're going to fork his project do is we're going to fork his project and we're going to put it underneath a and we're going to put it underneath a and we're going to put it underneath a foundation right so I think we're foundation right so I think we're foundation right so I think we're starting to see more of that there's a starting to see more of that there's a starting to see more of that there's a lot more work to be done there but um lot more work to be done there but um lot more work to be done there but um you know folks who are interested in the you know folks who are interested in the you know folks who are interested in the open SSF we're doing we're kind of open SSF we're doing we're kind of open SSF we're doing we're kind of fostering a lot of that second question fostering a lot of that second question fostering a lot of that second question so all of this is related to software so all of this is related to software so all of this is related to software componentry we've been focused probably componentry we've been focused probably componentry we've been focused probably for three years now on how do we deploy for three years now on how do we deploy for three years now on how do we deploy it so the hardware the IA infrastructure it so the hardware the IA infrastructure it so the hardware the IA infrastructure is code so do you know of a standard is code so do you know of a standard is code so do you know of a standard that's encapsulating those elements that that's encapsulating those elements that that's encapsulating those elements that would then be joined to the ESBOM to would then be joined to the ESBOM to would then be joined to the ESBOM to give us a complete vulnerability give us a complete vulnerability give us a complete vulnerability picture. So you're talking about like uh picture. So you're talking about like uh picture. So you're talking about like uh so so let's let's just use an example so so let's let's just use an example so so let's let's just use an example like hey I have some Terraform Terraform like hey I have some Terraform Terraform like hey I have some Terraform Terraform VPC storage uh cryptologology all of VPC storage uh cryptologology all of VPC storage uh cryptologology all of that stuff. that stuff. that stuff. Yeah. So I Yeah. So I Yeah. So I think that's I think a little bit less think that's I think a little bit less think that's I think a little bit less mature right now. Um, I think what we're mature right now. Um, I think what we're mature right now. Um, I think what we're starting to see is uh folks throwing starting to see is uh folks throwing starting to see is uh folks throwing some of that in the software bill of some of that in the software bill of some of that in the software bill of materials in some capacity. So like materials in some capacity. So like materials in some capacity. So like something like, hey, here's the here's something like, hey, here's the here's something like, hey, here's the here's the the uh VPC configuration file and we the the uh VPC configuration file and we the the uh VPC configuration file and we add that as something that's in there. I add that as something that's in there. I add that as something that's in there. I think the challenge is um you know think the challenge is um you know think the challenge is um you know software it's a little bit more I would software it's a little bit more I would software it's a little bit more I would say if I give you a binary um largely it say if I give you a binary um largely it say if I give you a binary um largely it should run the same on one system as should run the same on one system as should run the same on one system as another whereas if I give you another whereas if I give you another whereas if I give you infrastructure as code a lot of the infrastructure as code a lot of the infrastructure as code a lot of the stuff there it kind of gets complicated stuff there it kind of gets complicated stuff there it kind of gets complicated as this is you know theoretical VPC as this is you know theoretical VPC as this is you know theoretical VPC until I actually run it and when it until I actually run it and when it until I actually run it and when it becomes real VPC right uh so there's becomes real VPC right uh so there's becomes real VPC right uh so there's some challenge there yeah so what we some challenge there yeah so what we some challenge there yeah so what we we've done is we've made a visualization we've done is we've made a visualization we've done is we've made a visualization of all that so we're not using guac you of all that so we're not using guac you of all that so we're not using guac you that we have a a knowledge graph but um that we have a a knowledge graph but um that we have a a knowledge graph but um the developers laptop's different than the developers laptop's different than the developers laptop's different than the SIT environment which is different the SIT environment which is different the SIT environment which is different than the QA which is different than the than the QA which is different than the than the QA which is different than the prod. So it's been our work to see that prod. So it's been our work to see that prod. So it's been our work to see that we mean we we need that unique we mean we we need that unique we mean we we need that unique environment of each deployment and environment of each deployment and environment of each deployment and capture all that in the same way you're capture all that in the same way you're capture all that in the same way you're doing with component tree. So we'll help doing with component tree. So we'll help doing with component tree. So we'll help happy to talk more about it. Yeah. Yeah, happy to talk more about it. Yeah. Yeah, happy to talk more about it. Yeah. Yeah, definitely. And that's kind of actually definitely. And that's kind of actually definitely. And that's kind of actually one of the reasons again with like one of the reasons again with like one of the reasons again with like Cubscape is doing runtime Cubscape is doing runtime Cubscape is doing runtime uh correlation. And so I do think that uh correlation. And so I do think that uh correlation. And so I do think that there are tools that are sort of there are tools that are sort of there are tools that are sort of beginning to emerge or or integrations beginning to emerge or or integrations beginning to emerge or or integrations with tools that are beginning to emerge with tools that are beginning to emerge with tools that are beginning to emerge to essentially ensure that hey uh I'm to essentially ensure that hey uh I'm to essentially ensure that hey uh I'm running it and here's all the places I'm running it and here's all the places I'm running it and here's all the places I'm running it. And I think the next levels running it. And I think the next levels running it. And I think the next levels are going to be things like looking at are going to be things like looking at are going to be things like looking at um you know attack graphs and all those um you know attack graphs and all those um you know attack graphs and all those things and then looking at how it sort things and then looking at how it sort things and then looking at how it sort of aligns with with the you know the of aligns with with the you know the of aligns with with the you know the data that's coming from the supply chain data that's coming from the supply chain data that's coming from the supply chain from an ESBOM so that you know like hey from an ESBOM so that you know like hey from an ESBOM so that you know like hey actually there's a vulnerability here actually there's a vulnerability here actually there's a vulnerability here and because you're accessible on the and because you're accessible on the and because you're accessible on the network here here and here this is where network here here and here this is where network here here and here this is where where somebody could get in. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So after to for the closing remarks. So So after to for the closing remarks. So So after to for the closing remarks. So we if you are not tired of seeing we if you are not tired of seeing we if you are not tired of seeing attestations and you want to see them in attestations and you want to see them in attestations and you want to see them in action on how we're using a tested vex action on how we're using a tested vex action on how we're using a tested vex in the Kubernetes project to shoot the in the Kubernetes project to shoot the in the Kubernetes project to shoot the projects vex feeds uh I'm going to do a projects vex feeds uh I'm going to do a projects vex feeds uh I'm going to do a talk in like an hour from now. Um do you talk in like an hour from now. Um do you talk in like an hour from now. Um do you want to close it? Go ahead. Um and yeah want to close it? Go ahead. Um and yeah want to close it? Go ahead. Um and yeah so that takes us to the end of the um of so that takes us to the end of the um of so that takes us to the end of the um of the workshop. Um there are some useful the workshop. Um there are some useful the workshop. Um there are some useful links. Um everything that we just went links. Um everything that we just went links. Um everything that we just went through is in tutorial form in that through is in tutorial form in that through is in tutorial form in that GitHub repo that we shared in the GitHub repo that we shared in the GitHub repo that we shared in the beginning. Uh so that should get you if beginning. Uh so that should get you if beginning. Uh so that should get you if you want to go over this again if you're you want to go over this again if you're you want to go over this again if you're not bored. So yeah, you can uh try out not bored. So yeah, you can uh try out not bored. So yeah, you can uh try out all the tools and you're a go. Yep. All all the tools and you're a go. Yep. All all the tools and you're a go. Yep. All right. So thank you very much. Uh and right. So thank you very much. Uh and right. So thank you very much. Uh and we'll be around during the conference if we'll be around during the conference if we'll be around during the conference if you want to add questions, go through you want to add questions, go through you want to add questions, go through any of this again. Thanks.
