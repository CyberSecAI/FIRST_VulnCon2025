Kind: captions Language: en Hi all, welcome to our talk. So my name Hi all, welcome to our talk. So my name Hi all, welcome to our talk. So my name is Toby. Um I actually came to Seammens is Toby. Um I actually came to Seammens is Toby. Um I actually came to Seammens and uh yeah also was one of the and uh yeah also was one of the and uh yeah also was one of the initiating members of product search. So initiating members of product search. So initiating members of product search. So I set up the workflows, the processes, I set up the workflows, the processes, I set up the workflows, the processes, the organization, the uh yeah whole the organization, the uh yeah whole the organization, the uh yeah whole infrastructure with email server and infrastructure with email server and infrastructure with email server and whatever. I set all of that up and now whatever. I set all of that up and now whatever. I set all of that up and now I'm uh still in vulnerability management I'm uh still in vulnerability management I'm uh still in vulnerability management but in seammen's research and my but in seammen's research and my but in seammen's research and my colleague is Tom. He took over after I colleague is Tom. He took over after I colleague is Tom. He took over after I left. Yeah. Um hi uh my name is Tom KD. left. Yeah. Um hi uh my name is Tom KD. left. Yeah. Um hi uh my name is Tom KD. I'm was working for the last couple of I'm was working for the last couple of I'm was working for the last couple of years as a vulnerability and incident years as a vulnerability and incident years as a vulnerability and incident handler in what uh we call seammen's handler in what uh we call seammen's handler in what uh we call seammen's product and basically took over uh the product and basically took over uh the product and basically took over uh the foundations that Toby created where foundations that Toby created where foundations that Toby created where basically vulnerability handling and basically vulnerability handling and basically vulnerability handling and vulnerability monitoring was done with vulnerability monitoring was done with vulnerability monitoring was done with uh Microsoft office suit um in order to uh Microsoft office suit um in order to uh Microsoft office suit um in order to basically improve those uh processes and basically improve those uh processes and basically improve those uh processes and my role now is to basically work on the my role now is to basically work on the my role now is to basically work on the different processes and APIs of different processes and APIs of different processes and APIs of seammen's products to allow further seammen's products to allow further seammen's products to allow further automation which you will see in that automation which you will see in that automation which you will see in that talk. So, and uh now now a little bit of talk. So, and uh now now a little bit of talk. So, and uh now now a little bit of introduction to seammens actually introduction to seammens actually introduction to seammens actually because I think not all of you know what because I think not all of you know what because I think not all of you know what we are doing and I'd like you to know we are doing and I'd like you to know we are doing and I'd like you to know yeah what kind of challenges we are yeah what kind of challenges we are yeah what kind of challenges we are facing in regards to vulnerability facing in regards to vulnerability facing in regards to vulnerability management. So what is seammens doing? management. So what is seammens doing? management. So what is seammens doing? Seammens is first of all uh yeah Seammens is first of all uh yeah Seammens is first of all uh yeah creating products. We're developing a of creating products. We're developing a of creating products. We're developing a of software. We are developing embedded software. We are developing embedded software. We are developing embedded devices. We're developing SARS products devices. We're developing SARS products devices. We're developing SARS products whatever all over the place actually whatever all over the place actually whatever all over the place actually completely different product types. This completely different product types. This completely different product types. This is actually an industrial controller is actually an industrial controller is actually an industrial controller that you can see there which is usually that you can see there which is usually that you can see there which is usually yeah a PLC controlling factories whole yeah a PLC controlling factories whole yeah a PLC controlling factories whole factories and that's that's being factories and that's that's being factories and that's that's being produced actually yeah in the 10,000s produced actually yeah in the 10,000s produced actually yeah in the 10,000s and being sold out out of on on the and being sold out out of on on the and being sold out out of on on the market here. That's one part we are market here. That's one part we are market here. That's one part we are producing. The other the other item producing. The other the other item producing. The other the other item we're doing is we we're integrating we're doing is we we're integrating we're doing is we we're integrating solutions. So for single customers we solutions. So for single customers we solutions. So for single customers we are building factories for example. We are building factories for example. We are building factories for example. We are are are building yeah we're constructing building yeah we're constructing building yeah we're constructing buildings we are uh constructing a buildings we are uh constructing a buildings we are uh constructing a stadiums actually anything like that so stadiums actually anything like that so stadiums actually anything like that so very customized infrastructure for very customized infrastructure for very customized infrastructure for customers that are then taken over and customers that are then taken over and customers that are then taken over and being operated by uh by the customers being operated by uh by the customers being operated by uh by the customers themselves and last but not least we are themselves and last but not least we are themselves and last but not least we are also operating quite a lot of things not also operating quite a lot of things not also operating quite a lot of things not only IT infrastructure but also only IT infrastructure but also only IT infrastructure but also industrial control system infrastructure industrial control system infrastructure industrial control system infrastructure this is actually the factory uh that is this is actually the factory uh that is this is actually the factory uh that is producing those industrial controllers producing those industrial controllers producing those industrial controllers uh that you can see here and of course uh that you can see here and of course uh that you can see here and of course Yeah, all of that all of that is Yeah, all of that all of that is Yeah, all of that all of that is automated and we're operating all of automated and we're operating all of automated and we're operating all of that. So quite a broad area. And in that. So quite a broad area. And in that. So quite a broad area. And in regards to products, it's not only those regards to products, it's not only those regards to products, it's not only those industrial controls, it's also about industrial controls, it's also about industrial controls, it's also about trains. We're producing infrastructure trains. We're producing infrastructure trains. We're producing infrastructure for trains, including the traffic for trains, including the traffic for trains, including the traffic lights, for example, for the railways lights, for example, for the railways lights, for example, for the railways and whatever. So it's quite a broad and whatever. So it's quite a broad and whatever. So it's quite a broad scope that we have here and this is why scope that we have here and this is why scope that we have here and this is why yeah, we also have quite a distributed yeah, we also have quite a distributed yeah, we also have quite a distributed and and and yeah, not definitely not homogeneous. yeah, not definitely not homogeneous. yeah, not definitely not homogeneous. Yeah. Projects that are uh that are Yeah. Projects that are uh that are Yeah. Projects that are uh that are Yeah. actually being developed inside Yeah. actually being developed inside Yeah. actually being developed inside seammens here. So yeah, so now for a seammens here. So yeah, so now for a seammens here. So yeah, so now for a little bit of motivation for the little bit of motivation for the little bit of motivation for the beginning. So if we're thinking about beginning. So if we're thinking about beginning. So if we're thinking about kind of product security and kind of a kind of product security and kind of a kind of product security and kind of a seammens product search, the process seammens product search, the process seammens product search, the process that you know or that's publicly known that you know or that's publicly known that you know or that's publicly known is that there's basically a input of is that there's basically a input of is that there's basically a input of vulnerability information. So in our vulnerability information. So in our vulnerability information. So in our case product search at semens.com where case product search at semens.com where case product search at semens.com where any researcher, security company, any researcher, security company, any researcher, security company, individual can basically send their individual can basically send their individual can basically send their security related uh questions and cases security related uh questions and cases security related uh questions and cases to. Um then there's a magic process in to. Um then there's a magic process in to. Um then there's a magic process in between and on the other hand uh there between and on the other hand uh there between and on the other hand uh there is basically a website of uh PDF uh is basically a website of uh PDF uh is basically a website of uh PDF uh documents, HTML documents where you can documents, HTML documents where you can documents, HTML documents where you can uh download information about uh download information about uh download information about vulnerabilities. That's basically the vulnerabilities. That's basically the vulnerabilities. That's basically the the known part but um please next slide. the known part but um please next slide. the known part but um please next slide. Um there's a slide that you have seen Um there's a slide that you have seen Um there's a slide that you have seen before. Um so the amount of before. Um so the amount of before. Um so the amount of vulnerabilities and the amount of data vulnerabilities and the amount of data vulnerabilities and the amount of data that we have to handle is raising over that we have to handle is raising over that we have to handle is raising over the year. You have seen that slide the year. You have seen that slide the year. You have seen that slide before. This is basically the number of before. This is basically the number of before. This is basically the number of vulnerabilities across the year. What I vulnerabilities across the year. What I vulnerabilities across the year. What I want to really get into is um are you want to really get into is um are you want to really get into is um are you aware of um this triangle please? Next aware of um this triangle please? Next aware of um this triangle please? Next slide. Uh which is uh what we call the slide. Uh which is uh what we call the slide. Uh which is uh what we call the Bermuda triangle of undiscovered or Bermuda triangle of undiscovered or Bermuda triangle of undiscovered or unpublished vulnerabilities. Next slide. unpublished vulnerabilities. Next slide. unpublished vulnerabilities. Next slide. um because that is basically a point um because that is basically a point um because that is basically a point where the where the where the microorganization still was using a very microorganization still was using a very microorganization still was using a very manual process to sign CVES and manual process to sign CVES and manual process to sign CVES and basically if you were not part of the basically if you were not part of the basically if you were not part of the ecosystem the resources were allegedly ecosystem the resources were allegedly ecosystem the resources were allegedly missing to give you out those CVEs. So missing to give you out those CVEs. So missing to give you out those CVEs. So basically in 2016 um the CNA ecosystem basically in 2016 um the CNA ecosystem basically in 2016 um the CNA ecosystem was created. So semens got its own CVA was created. So semens got its own CVA was created. So semens got its own CVA uh CNA and we could start uh amazingly uh CNA and we could start uh amazingly uh CNA and we could start uh amazingly uh to publish this vulnerabilities or uh to publish this vulnerabilities or uh to publish this vulnerabilities or interact with uh the ecosystem in a much interact with uh the ecosystem in a much interact with uh the ecosystem in a much better much more efficient way. But better much more efficient way. But better much more efficient way. But there's yet this other point where kind there's yet this other point where kind there's yet this other point where kind of the entire ecosystem is talking about of the entire ecosystem is talking about of the entire ecosystem is talking about automation and uh things like the um automation and uh things like the um automation and uh things like the um record submission and upload service record submission and upload service record submission and upload service have been introduced. So for us it's now have been introduced. So for us it's now have been introduced. So for us it's now really really easy to allocate and really really easy to allocate and really really easy to allocate and assign uh CVEEs to uh our products or to assign uh CVEEs to uh our products or to assign uh CVEEs to uh our products or to kind of the ecosystem. But now kind of kind of the ecosystem. But now kind of kind of the ecosystem. But now kind of we see that kind of exponential raise um we see that kind of exponential raise um we see that kind of exponential raise um in the numbers. We are also now talking in the numbers. We are also now talking in the numbers. We are also now talking about software bill of materials and about software bill of materials and about software bill of materials and backs. So basically giving vulnerability backs. So basically giving vulnerability backs. So basically giving vulnerability information not only for the upstream information not only for the upstream information not only for the upstream components but also for the specific components but also for the specific components but also for the specific components that users use or kind of uh components that users use or kind of uh components that users use or kind of uh the ecosystem uses uh in practice. So a the ecosystem uses uh in practice. So a the ecosystem uses uh in practice. So a customer might ask us like what is the customer might ask us like what is the customer might ask us like what is the effect of this ever vulnerability in effect of this ever vulnerability in effect of this ever vulnerability in this component. So basically the problem this component. So basically the problem this component. So basically the problem that we're seeing is um exponential in that we're seeing is um exponential in that we're seeing is um exponential in multiple multiple multiple dimensions. So dimensions. So dimensions. So um basically our problem is to handle um basically our problem is to handle um basically our problem is to handle the um issues of the supply chain. Yeah. And basically if you look chain. Yeah. And basically if you look chain. Yeah. And basically if you look at asbombs and if you look at the supply at asbombs and if you look at the supply at asbombs and if you look at the supply chains like they are really big and they chains like they are really big and they chains like they are really big and they are really like not looked into really are really like not looked into really are really like not looked into really big like there's this comic from this big like there's this comic from this big like there's this comic from this guy about Nebraska. I don't know whether guy about Nebraska. I don't know whether guy about Nebraska. I don't know whether you remember that specific situation you remember that specific situation you remember that specific situation when you're a vulnerability handler. uh when you're a vulnerability handler. uh when you're a vulnerability handler. uh you might know and we want to now talk you might know and we want to now talk you might know and we want to now talk about what is necessary and what we do about what is necessary and what we do about what is necessary and what we do to basically handle this situation. part to basically handle this situation. part to basically handle this situation. part of it as a vision but um of it as a vision but um of it as a vision but um yeah so h how does the supply chain look yeah so h how does the supply chain look yeah so h how does the supply chain look at look like from our point of view so at look like from our point of view so at look like from our point of view so this is what you can see here so it's this is what you can see here so it's this is what you can see here so it's quite a simple example so so linear quite a simple example so so linear quite a simple example so so linear supply chain uh we will make that more supply chain uh we will make that more supply chain uh we will make that more complex later on but uh if you look at complex later on but uh if you look at complex later on but uh if you look at yeah maybe a typical flow here so on the yeah maybe a typical flow here so on the yeah maybe a typical flow here so on the left side you can see the set lip uh left side you can see the set lip uh left side you can see the set lip uh that might contain a vulnerability which that might contain a vulnerability which that might contain a vulnerability which is then embedded inside opensl which is is then embedded inside opensl which is is then embedded inside opensl which is then embedded inside Apache going over then embedded inside Apache going over then embedded inside Apache going over some kind of internal web server maybe some kind of internal web server maybe some kind of internal web server maybe an internal project that is being an internal project that is being an internal project that is being developed inside the company which is developed inside the company which is developed inside the company which is then integrated in some kind of then integrated in some kind of then integrated in some kind of subproduct that is serves as a common subproduct that is serves as a common subproduct that is serves as a common base for multiple products which then is base for multiple products which then is base for multiple products which then is integrated into a solution or a machine. integrated into a solution or a machine. integrated into a solution or a machine. So some so for example complete factory So some so for example complete factory So some so for example complete factory which is then deployed yeah to a certain which is then deployed yeah to a certain which is then deployed yeah to a certain customer. So so that's a typical supply customer. So so that's a typical supply customer. So so that's a typical supply chain and uh our problem that we have chain and uh our problem that we have chain and uh our problem that we have actually is those are entirely different actually is those are entirely different actually is those are entirely different project types. So on the one side it's project types. So on the one side it's project types. So on the one side it's software development on the right side software development on the right side software development on the right side it's more about setting up the systems it's more about setting up the systems it's more about setting up the systems configuring the systems hardening the configuring the systems hardening the configuring the systems hardening the systems having networks and systems with systems having networks and systems with systems having networks and systems with IP addresses whatever and um our problem IP addresses whatever and um our problem IP addresses whatever and um our problem here first of all is uh so so if there's here first of all is uh so so if there's here first of all is uh so so if there's a vulnerability on the left side inside a vulnerability on the left side inside a vulnerability on the left side inside setl and u yeah this is reported in the setl and u yeah this is reported in the setl and u yeah this is reported in the right way and processed in the right way right way and processed in the right way right way and processed in the right way um and uh and in some case in some place um and uh and in some case in some place um and uh and in some case in some place actually inside that supply chain actually inside that supply chain actually inside that supply chain Somebody just drops the vulnerability Somebody just drops the vulnerability Somebody just drops the vulnerability and drops the information about the and drops the information about the and drops the information about the vulnerability, we have a problem because vulnerability, we have a problem because vulnerability, we have a problem because then we do not know about it on the then we do not know about it on the then we do not know about it on the right side actually in the other right side actually in the other right side actually in the other projects. So we need to take care that projects. So we need to take care that projects. So we need to take care that information is forwarded about the information is forwarded about the information is forwarded about the vulnerabilities very important actually vulnerabilities very important actually vulnerabilities very important actually for us and to to to keep that chain for us and to to to keep that chain for us and to to to keep that chain actually yeah closed and connected to actually yeah closed and connected to actually yeah closed and connected to each other. Now if if you're looking at each other. Now if if you're looking at each other. Now if if you're looking at that whole supply chain so here on on that whole supply chain so here on on that whole supply chain so here on on the left side you can see yeah certain the left side you can see yeah certain the left side you can see yeah certain vulnerability which is then embedded uh vulnerability which is then embedded uh vulnerability which is then embedded uh inside OpenSSL. So and u we just tried inside OpenSSL. So and u we just tried inside OpenSSL. So and u we just tried to depict that yeah graphically here. So to depict that yeah graphically here. So to depict that yeah graphically here. So it's somewhere inside OpenSSL and below it's somewhere inside OpenSSL and below it's somewhere inside OpenSSL and below you can see the CVS scores that's you can see the CVS scores that's you can see the CVS scores that's everything that that's just exemplary everything that that's just exemplary everything that that's just exemplary but what I want to stress here. So we but what I want to stress here. So we but what I want to stress here. So we assign a CVSS score here on the left assign a CVSS score here on the left assign a CVSS score here on the left side for a certain vulnerability. side for a certain vulnerability. side for a certain vulnerability. However that CVSS score will change when However that CVSS score will change when However that CVSS score will change when it's being embedded actually inside the it's being embedded actually inside the it's being embedded actually inside the different environments because it's different environments because it's different environments because it's going to be further embedded further going to be further embedded further going to be further embedded further nested inside the environments of the nested inside the environments of the nested inside the environments of the other products and it might be that other products and it might be that other products and it might be that maybe the CVS score lowers itself. So maybe the CVS score lowers itself. So maybe the CVS score lowers itself. So compar going from 6.6 to 5.6 but it compar going from 6.6 to 5.6 but it compar going from 6.6 to 5.6 but it might raise again because for example might raise again because for example might raise again because for example inside the internal web server which has inside the internal web server which has inside the internal web server which has access to the source code of course to access to the source code of course to access to the source code of course to open SSL and ZLIP it might offer another open SSL and ZLIP it might offer another open SSL and ZLIP it might offer another way actually so that that certain way actually so that that certain way actually so that that certain vulnerability is being exposed to the vulnerability is being exposed to the vulnerability is being exposed to the outside and suddenly the CVSS score is outside and suddenly the CVSS score is outside and suddenly the CVSS score is being raised for that yeah certain being raised for that yeah certain being raised for that yeah certain embedding of set lip inside the the embedding of set lip inside the the embedding of set lip inside the the internal web server and then going on. internal web server and then going on. internal web server and then going on. So, so you really need to track the CVSS So, so you really need to track the CVSS So, so you really need to track the CVSS score over time over all of those score over time over all of those score over time over all of those projects and this is really a projects and this is really a projects and this is really a challenge at least for us and I think challenge at least for us and I think challenge at least for us and I think for quite many uh other organizations as for quite many uh other organizations as for quite many uh other organizations as well. If you look at the CVSS score if well. If you look at the CVSS score if well. If you look at the CVSS score if you look at uh the vulnerabilities and you look at uh the vulnerabilities and you look at uh the vulnerabilities and the corresponding descriptions here on the corresponding descriptions here on the corresponding descriptions here on the left side we we describe the root the left side we we describe the root the left side we we describe the root cause we describe the the weakness cause we describe the the weakness cause we describe the the weakness actually that's behind that. So the actually that's behind that. So the actually that's behind that. So the background of a certain vulnerability. background of a certain vulnerability. background of a certain vulnerability. If you go to the right side, you If you go to the right side, you If you go to the right side, you describe more the safety, the mission, describe more the safety, the mission, describe more the safety, the mission, the impact. So so which is also more the impact. So so which is also more the impact. So so which is also more relevant actually to the operators of relevant actually to the operators of relevant actually to the operators of certain system. They usually do not care certain system. They usually do not care certain system. They usually do not care about the exact root cause. They want to about the exact root cause. They want to about the exact root cause. They want to know how they are affected inside the know how they are affected inside the know how they are affected inside the environment uh inside. Yeah. Also the environment uh inside. Yeah. Also the environment uh inside. Yeah. Also the operated infrastructure inside yeah the operated infrastructure inside yeah the operated infrastructure inside yeah the certain networks how a certain certain networks how a certain certain networks how a certain vulnerability can be yeah estimated and vulnerability can be yeah estimated and vulnerability can be yeah estimated and can be can be can be evaluated. how critical it is for a evaluated. how critical it is for a evaluated. how critical it is for a certain operator. So the context really certain operator. So the context really certain operator. So the context really changed from the left to the right side changed from the left to the right side changed from the left to the right side and we need to pay attention to that. So and we need to pay attention to that. So and we need to pay attention to that. So so it it it's really not useful at all so it it it's really not useful at all so it it it's really not useful at all to have the original vulnerability to have the original vulnerability to have the original vulnerability description uh of a vulnerability inside description uh of a vulnerability inside description uh of a vulnerability inside set for an end customer of Seammens set for an end customer of Seammens set for an end customer of Seammens who's a factory operator. He does not who's a factory operator. He does not who's a factory operator. He does not know anything about Zetlip. He just know anything about Zetlip. He just know anything about Zetlip. He just knows about the machine that is maybe knows about the machine that is maybe knows about the machine that is maybe yeah bottling uh yeah beer into yeah yeah bottling uh yeah beer into yeah yeah bottling uh yeah beer into yeah certain bottles into the glass bottles certain bottles into the glass bottles certain bottles into the glass bottles anything like that. he does not have a anything like that. he does not have a anything like that. he does not have a clue about anything that's in the clue about anything that's in the clue about anything that's in the background and in on the inside of the background and in on the inside of the background and in on the inside of the software software software architecture. So we need to do a architecture. So we need to do a architecture. So we need to do a vulnerability reiter rating. We need to vulnerability reiter rating. We need to vulnerability reiter rating. We need to really think about okay how to yeah really think about okay how to yeah really think about okay how to yeah describe the vulnerabilities and also describe the vulnerabilities and also describe the vulnerabilities and also how to evaluate those vulnerabilities how to evaluate those vulnerabilities how to evaluate those vulnerabilities and also to re-evaluate those and also to re-evaluate those and also to re-evaluate those vulnerabilities over time inside the vulnerabilities over time inside the vulnerabilities over time inside the different different different projects. And last but not least uh if projects. And last but not least uh if projects. And last but not least uh if you look at uh the different components you look at uh the different components you look at uh the different components here if you look at what what's actually here if you look at what what's actually here if you look at what what's actually inside a company so internal what's inside a company so internal what's inside a company so internal what's external we need to think about of external we need to think about of external we need to think about of course automation so so uh and this course automation so so uh and this course automation so so uh and this cannot be solved only within one cannot be solved only within one cannot be solved only within one organization we need to think about organization we need to think about organization we need to think about crossorganizational data exchange we crossorganizational data exchange we crossorganizational data exchange we need to yeah think about yeah the the need to yeah think about yeah the the need to yeah think about yeah the the standardized formats so for example CESF standardized formats so for example CESF standardized formats so for example CESF for example CVSS another example for for example CVSS another example for for example CVSS another example for example also espawns which play a really example also espawns which play a really example also espawns which play a really important role in that context as Maybe maybe let me add to that specific Maybe maybe let me add to that specific Maybe maybe let me add to that specific slide before. So one of the contexts slide before. So one of the contexts slide before. So one of the contexts that we pretty uh pretty much see in that we pretty uh pretty much see in that we pretty uh pretty much see in this ecosystem is that along the supply this ecosystem is that along the supply this ecosystem is that along the supply chain there are many people involved chain there are many people involved chain there are many people involved that basically have very different views that basically have very different views that basically have very different views on the systems. So typically we go with on the systems. So typically we go with on the systems. So typically we go with an approach like have one tool to rule an approach like have one tool to rule an approach like have one tool to rule them all. Everybody's using that tool. them all. Everybody's using that tool. them all. Everybody's using that tool. Everybody everything's going to be fine. Everybody everything's going to be fine. Everybody everything's going to be fine. but kind of force the satellite people but kind of force the satellite people but kind of force the satellite people to use the same infrastructure or same to use the same infrastructure or same to use the same infrastructure or same tooling as the uh dep uh run or operate tooling as the uh dep uh run or operate tooling as the uh dep uh run or operate a airport people that's not going to a airport people that's not going to a airport people that's not going to fly. So basically our focus is really to fly. So basically our focus is really to fly. So basically our focus is really to make sure that the different tools that make sure that the different tools that make sure that the different tools that are written for partly different use are written for partly different use are written for partly different use cases um interact in a good way to um cases um interact in a good way to um cases um interact in a good way to um leverage the same data. So those are leverage the same data. So those are leverage the same data. So those are pretty different but on the other hand pretty different but on the other hand pretty different but on the other hand kind of what we are doing here and this kind of what we are doing here and this kind of what we are doing here and this is also something that we internally see is also something that we internally see is also something that we internally see a lot kind of there are a lot of fights a lot kind of there are a lot of fights a lot kind of there are a lot of fights like this is a component this is a like this is a component this is a like this is a component this is a product this is an application this is product this is an application this is product this is an application this is an API like you got several terms for an API like you got several terms for an API like you got several terms for what is basically you recursively take what is basically you recursively take what is basically you recursively take some dependencies throw them in a bowl some dependencies throw them in a bowl some dependencies throw them in a bowl put some glue code on it and distribute put some glue code on it and distribute put some glue code on it and distribute it further. So basically the recursive it further. So basically the recursive it further. So basically the recursive problem is kind of the same across every problem is kind of the same across every problem is kind of the same across every layer of that chain but the technical layer of that chain but the technical layer of that chain but the technical implementation or the tooling around implementation or the tooling around implementation or the tooling around that might be very very different that might be very very different that might be very very different according to the specific use according to the specific use according to the specific use case. So um and of course if you have a case. So um and of course if you have a case. So um and of course if you have a single vulnerability there might be single vulnerability there might be single vulnerability there might be several products actually being affected several products actually being affected several products actually being affected by that same vulnerability and we wanted by that same vulnerability and we wanted by that same vulnerability and we wanted to give you an example here for one of to give you an example here for one of to give you an example here for one of our advisories. So you can't read the our advisories. So you can't read the our advisories. So you can't read the text. Uh that's not really necessary text. Uh that's not really necessary text. Uh that's not really necessary because we zoomed in. Uh so that's because we zoomed in. Uh so that's because we zoomed in. Uh so that's exactly one CVE that's being described exactly one CVE that's being described exactly one CVE that's being described in that uh advisory and we have uh in that uh advisory and we have uh in that uh advisory and we have uh multiple CVSs vectors and multiple multiple CVSs vectors and multiple multiple CVSs vectors and multiple scores. So on the top you can actually scores. So on the top you can actually scores. So on the top you can actually see the upstream uh rating uh uh that see the upstream uh rating uh uh that see the upstream uh rating uh uh that was coming into uh the yeah this the was coming into uh the yeah this the was coming into uh the yeah this the product search actually and then you can product search actually and then you can product search actually and then you can see different vectors actually that were see different vectors actually that were see different vectors actually that were evaluated according to the context of a evaluated according to the context of a evaluated according to the context of a certain vulnerability inside the certain vulnerability inside the certain vulnerability inside the different products and here you can see different products and here you can see different products and here you can see you've got different scores. So we've you've got different scores. So we've you've got different scores. So we've got nine on the above and we've got 7.7 got nine on the above and we've got 7.7 got nine on the above and we've got 7.7 for the below vulnerability. Just as an for the below vulnerability. Just as an for the below vulnerability. Just as an example, that's real. We need to assign example, that's real. We need to assign example, that's real. We need to assign different CVSS scores, different CVSs different CVSS scores, different CVSs different CVSS scores, different CVSs vectors. We need to write different vectors. We need to write different vectors. We need to write different descriptions how a certain vulnerability descriptions how a certain vulnerability descriptions how a certain vulnerability is being affected inside the different products. So now a little bit back to products. So now a little bit back to products. So now a little bit back to motivation. So we showed you that the motivation. So we showed you that the motivation. So we showed you that the number of vulnerabilities is rising. uh number of vulnerabilities is rising. uh number of vulnerabilities is rising. uh the number of requests is rising and uh the number of requests is rising and uh the number of requests is rising and uh that the problem of a supply chain that the problem of a supply chain that the problem of a supply chain exists but also if we look at that kind exists but also if we look at that kind exists but also if we look at that kind of look at a specific product specific of look at a specific product specific of look at a specific product specific example you can take anything you can example you can take anything you can example you can take anything you can take a PLC you can take a SAS service if take a PLC you can take a SAS service if take a PLC you can take a SAS service if you look at the supply chain on the left you look at the supply chain on the left you look at the supply chain on the left side basically you have a lot of side basically you have a lot of side basically you have a lot of customers uh uh a lot of upstream customers uh uh a lot of upstream customers uh uh a lot of upstream suppliers so basically the development suppliers so basically the development suppliers so basically the development people take some dependencies that in people take some dependencies that in people take some dependencies that in turn might also consist of dependencies turn might also consist of dependencies turn might also consist of dependencies so on the right left side you have some so on the right left side you have some so on the right left side you have some exponential problem and The PLC creating exponential problem and The PLC creating exponential problem and The PLC creating people do not want to analyze every people do not want to analyze every people do not want to analyze every vulnerability that we call basically for vulnerability that we call basically for vulnerability that we call basically for the inductive part N minus 3, but they the inductive part N minus 3, but they the inductive part N minus 3, but they want to rely on what these N minus one want to rely on what these N minus one want to rely on what these N minus one people are saying because it does not people are saying because it does not people are saying because it does not really make sense if every user on that really make sense if every user on that really make sense if every user on that side or me every user of that library side or me every user of that library side or me every user of that library analyzes all of the vulnerabilities that analyzes all of the vulnerabilities that analyzes all of the vulnerabilities that go into that dependency. So you might go into that dependency. So you might go into that dependency. So you might say like, oh, we got the Aspen, we're say like, oh, we got the Aspen, we're say like, oh, we got the Aspen, we're covered. Amazing Vex, we're covered. But covered. Amazing Vex, we're covered. But covered. Amazing Vex, we're covered. But on the other side, what we also have is on the other side, what we also have is on the other side, what we also have is the downstream kind of the users and the downstream kind of the users and the downstream kind of the users and customers in the ecosystem. So look at customers in the ecosystem. So look at customers in the ecosystem. So look at back at log 4j for example, we had a back at log 4j for example, we had a back at log 4j for example, we had a vulnerability that we needed to really vulnerability that we needed to really vulnerability that we needed to really assess what does that mean for our assess what does that mean for our assess what does that mean for our ecosystem. So basically for every ecosystem. So basically for every ecosystem. So basically for every component, we need to be able to say component, we need to be able to say component, we need to be able to say like where is this used and which like where is this used and which like where is this used and which customer might be affected in which way customer might be affected in which way customer might be affected in which way in order to prioritize the fixing and in order to prioritize the fixing and in order to prioritize the fixing and the communication effort. So when you the communication effort. So when you the communication effort. So when you look at the uh downstream side, you also look at the uh downstream side, you also look at the uh downstream side, you also got kind of an exponential uh increase got kind of an exponential uh increase got kind of an exponential uh increase of problem and we really really need to of problem and we really really need to of problem and we really really need to make sure that we and seammens but we as make sure that we and seammens but we as make sure that we and seammens but we as an an an ecosystem fix the information flow and ecosystem fix the information flow and ecosystem fix the information flow and the information forwarding across that the information forwarding across that the information forwarding across that supply chain in order to allow those N supply chain in order to allow those N supply chain in order to allow those N plus3 people, the operators of critical plus3 people, the operators of critical plus3 people, the operators of critical infrastructures of airports and all that infrastructures of airports and all that infrastructures of airports and all that stuff to really assess the stuff to really assess the stuff to really assess the vulnerabilities that they need to assess vulnerabilities that they need to assess vulnerabilities that they need to assess and not kind of the scanning all the n and not kind of the scanning all the n and not kind of the scanning all the n minus3 vulnerabilities in zlip because minus3 vulnerabilities in zlip because minus3 vulnerabilities in zlip because the airport operator really doesn't care the airport operator really doesn't care the airport operator really doesn't care about zetlip I guess and and and uh about zetlip I guess and and and uh about zetlip I guess and and and uh actually one goal of uh us at at the actually one goal of uh us at at the actually one goal of uh us at at the moment is also to take to make advantage moment is also to take to make advantage moment is also to take to make advantage actually of that whole structure here actually of that whole structure here actually of that whole structure here and to make transparency on actually the and to make transparency on actually the and to make transparency on actually the whole upstream and the whole downstream whole upstream and the whole downstream whole upstream and the whole downstream in regards to vulnerability ratings in regards to vulnerability ratings in regards to vulnerability ratings because if someone rates a vulnerability because if someone rates a vulnerability because if someone rates a vulnerability here of course it's a wallet for here of course it's a wallet for here of course it's a wallet for multiple products and then if it's done multiple products and then if it's done multiple products and then if it's done once yeah the others can also take over once yeah the others can also take over once yeah the others can also take over that ratings. So, so there's a lot of that ratings. So, so there's a lot of that ratings. So, so there's a lot of synergies actually that can be made use synergies actually that can be made use synergies actually that can be made use of and you need the right tooling of and you need the right tooling of and you need the right tooling actually to to make sure that all of actually to to make sure that all of actually to to make sure that all of that transparency, all of that data that transparency, all of that data that transparency, all of that data exchange is being enabled and also being exchange is being enabled and also being exchange is being enabled and also being forwarded to yeah the developers, the forwarded to yeah the developers, the forwarded to yeah the developers, the security experts who are actually security experts who are actually security experts who are actually raiding the raiding the raiding the vulnerabilities. So basically what we vulnerabilities. So basically what we vulnerabilities. So basically what we want to show you here is want to show you here is want to show you here is bas and some examples of how we do that bas and some examples of how we do that bas and some examples of how we do that in the company. Each of those boxes are in the company. Each of those boxes are in the company. Each of those boxes are of kind of very high complexity. So I of kind of very high complexity. So I of kind of very high complexity. So I think we can talk half a day for every think we can talk half a day for every think we can talk half a day for every of those boxes day at least. But we want of those boxes day at least. But we want of those boxes day at least. But we want to give you a high level picture on how to give you a high level picture on how to give you a high level picture on how we see those interacting and how we uh we see those interacting and how we uh we see those interacting and how we uh envision the information flows. So envision the information flows. So envision the information flows. So basically everything in our vision is basically everything in our vision is basically everything in our vision is center around the product teams because center around the product teams because center around the product teams because we can have the most amazing tooling. If we can have the most amazing tooling. If we can have the most amazing tooling. If the product teams do not use it, we're the product teams do not use it, we're the product teams do not use it, we're lost. We need the information from the lost. We need the information from the lost. We need the information from the product teams because they are the product teams because they are the product teams because they are the experts. we heard it in different talks experts. we heard it in different talks experts. we heard it in different talks to assess the vulnerabilities and we to assess the vulnerabilities and we to assess the vulnerabilities and we needed uh somehow needed uh somehow needed uh somehow to want them participate into the to want them participate into the to want them participate into the system. So basically that's the center system. So basically that's the center system. So basically that's the center of all our efforts. So as a first step of all our efforts. So as a first step of all our efforts. So as a first step what we do is we ask those uh product what we do is we ask those uh product what we do is we ask those uh product people to basically give us some people to basically give us some people to basically give us some information about now we call it the information about now we call it the information about now we call it the sbomb the uh what their products exists sbomb the uh what their products exists sbomb the uh what their products exists from. This was very much based on from. This was very much based on from. This was very much based on license clearing. You use license license clearing. You use license license clearing. You use license clearing data for vulnerability clearing data for vulnerability clearing data for vulnerability handling, different use cases, different handling, different use cases, different handling, different use cases, different data quality. Like as I said, a whole data quality. Like as I said, a whole data quality. Like as I said, a whole discussion in its own. But then you discussion in its own. But then you discussion in its own. But then you realize that this sbomb basically has realize that this sbomb basically has realize that this sbomb basically has some components. Then you have different some components. Then you have different some components. Then you have different tools for sbomb. You have kind tools for sbomb. You have kind tools for sbomb. You have kind of okay insert vendors here. But all of of okay insert vendors here. But all of of okay insert vendors here. But all of those have basically different ids. those have basically different ids. those have basically different ids. There are concepts like pearl and CPE. There are concepts like pearl and CPE. There are concepts like pearl and CPE. But we were also talking a lot that But we were also talking a lot that But we were also talking a lot that these concepts are in theory amazing, these concepts are in theory amazing, these concepts are in theory amazing, but in practice don't work, at least for but in practice don't work, at least for but in practice don't work, at least for us. So what we built is like basically a us. So what we built is like basically a us. So what we built is like basically a product mapping database where we say product mapping database where we say product mapping database where we say like oh we see seen that component uh like oh we see seen that component uh like oh we see seen that component uh before we see that here in um the before we see that here in um the before we see that here in um the license clearing tool we seen that here license clearing tool we seen that here license clearing tool we seen that here in that other tool but also make um in that other tool but also make um in that other tool but also make um please be aware that is this is not kind please be aware that is this is not kind please be aware that is this is not kind of on the consistency of like this is of on the consistency of like this is of on the consistency of like this is open SSL but this is openSSL this is open SSL but this is openSSL this is open SSL but this is openSSL this is open SSL in Fedora this is openSSL in open SSL in Fedora this is openSSL in open SSL in Fedora this is openSSL in Debian this is openSSL in redhead and Debian this is openSSL in redhead and Debian this is openSSL in redhead and these are all different components these are all different components these are all different components coming back to the supply chain so coming back to the supply chain so coming back to the supply chain so there's a different package packaging of there's a different package packaging of there's a different package packaging of one library in a different ecosystem. one library in a different ecosystem. one library in a different ecosystem. Those are all different components that Those are all different components that Those are all different components that we have to somehow we have to somehow we have to somehow um uh look at different. So basically um uh look at different. So basically um uh look at different. So basically then we have a ground truth of what is then we have a ground truth of what is then we have a ground truth of what is it that we're looking at. So at the next it that we're looking at. So at the next it that we're looking at. So at the next step we got something internally that we step we got something internally that we step we got something internally that we call basically our vulnerability call basically our vulnerability call basically our vulnerability intelligence where we try to store the intelligence where we try to store the intelligence where we try to store the impact of vulnerabilities according to impact of vulnerabilities according to impact of vulnerabilities according to specific entities in our supply chain specific entities in our supply chain specific entities in our supply chain graph. So basically first and foremost graph. So basically first and foremost graph. So basically first and foremost this is fed by uh external sources. So this is fed by uh external sources. So this is fed by uh external sources. So for example the CVE uh database this is for example the CVE uh database this is for example the CVE uh database this is a great resource for upstream a great resource for upstream a great resource for upstream vulnerabilities but also public um for vulnerabilities but also public um for vulnerabilities but also public um for example uh CESF advisories. But so while example uh CESF advisories. But so while example uh CESF advisories. But so while I want to propose you here to use and I want to propose you here to use and I want to propose you here to use and leverage CEF because it's an amazing leverage CEF because it's an amazing leverage CEF because it's an amazing standard. Uh there are also other standard. Uh there are also other standard. Uh there are also other standards here. So the GitHub security standards here. So the GitHub security standards here. So the GitHub security advisory project and all those other advisory project and all those other advisory project and all those other resources OSV we take that into our resources OSV we take that into our resources OSV we take that into our vulnerability intelligence. So once we vulnerability intelligence. So once we vulnerability intelligence. So once we discover that there's a vulnerability discover that there's a vulnerability discover that there's a vulnerability for a product in the scope of the for a product in the scope of the for a product in the scope of the product that's used, we notify kind of a product that's used, we notify kind of a product that's used, we notify kind of a central we call it vulnerability tracker central we call it vulnerability tracker central we call it vulnerability tracker whatever um that is basically something whatever um that is basically something whatever um that is basically something where we kind of request information where we kind of request information where we kind of request information about how is that product um impacted by about how is that product um impacted by about how is that product um impacted by that vulnerability. that in turn will that vulnerability. that in turn will that vulnerability. that in turn will then leverage a connection to the then leverage a connection to the then leverage a connection to the product team to allow the product team product team to allow the product team product team to allow the product team in their way to answer the question of in their way to answer the question of in their way to answer the question of what is the impact exploitability uh what is the impact exploitability uh what is the impact exploitability uh severity of that vulnerability in that severity of that vulnerability in that severity of that vulnerability in that context. So we basically take that context. So we basically take that context. So we basically take that information and put that uh oh no there information and put that uh oh no there information and put that uh oh no there are other sources for vulnerability are other sources for vulnerability are other sources for vulnerability obviously we have many vulnerability obviously we have many vulnerability obviously we have many vulnerability scanners that find specific scanners that find specific scanners that find specific vulnerabilities and those have to be vulnerabilities and those have to be vulnerabilities and those have to be handled also. So there's also another handled also. So there's also another handled also. So there's also another source of tickets basically. But once source of tickets basically. But once source of tickets basically. But once some somebody says like this is how it some somebody says like this is how it some somebody says like this is how it affects me that information is kind of affects me that information is kind of affects me that information is kind of forwarded to product search in order to forwarded to product search in order to forwarded to product search in order to be then in turn forwarded back into the be then in turn forwarded back into the be then in turn forwarded back into the vulnerability intelligence where we vulnerability intelligence where we vulnerability intelligence where we basically can take that same information basically can take that same information basically can take that same information and pass it along the supply chain. So and pass it along the supply chain. So and pass it along the supply chain. So next slide please. Um so basically we next slide please. Um so basically we next slide please. Um so basically we create another ticket for another uh create another ticket for another uh create another ticket for another uh entity in the supply chain but now entity in the supply chain but now entity in the supply chain but now basically you realize that there's not basically you realize that there's not basically you realize that there's not only one vulnerability tracker but there only one vulnerability tracker but there only one vulnerability tracker but there is next slide please uh many of them um is next slide please uh many of them um is next slide please uh many of them um it's because we oh did I not okay uh it's because we oh did I not okay uh it's because we oh did I not okay uh animations fail this will come so once animations fail this will come so once animations fail this will come so once this is basically done through uh the this is basically done through uh the this is basically done through uh the supply chain we can then in turn um take supply chain we can then in turn um take supply chain we can then in turn um take this vulnerability information and put this vulnerability information and put this vulnerability information and put it also back uh into the uh external it also back uh into the uh external it also back uh into the uh external databases so please uh again. So for databases so please uh again. So for databases so please uh again. So for example, we as Semens product and you example, we as Semens product and you example, we as Semens product and you saw that in the beginning have that list saw that in the beginning have that list saw that in the beginning have that list of security advisories that we are of security advisories that we are of security advisories that we are publishing, we would want to also put publishing, we would want to also put publishing, we would want to also put that into back into the CVE database that into back into the CVE database that into back into the CVE database because we want to have kind of a common because we want to have kind of a common because we want to have kind of a common database that all of us are using that database that all of us are using that database that all of us are using that the scanner vendors are using to get the scanner vendors are using to get the scanner vendors are using to get that information but due to uh that information but due to uh that information but due to uh limitations Toby will talk about it. limitations Toby will talk about it. limitations Toby will talk about it. Yeah. And basically ah no my animation Yeah. And basically ah no my animation Yeah. And basically ah no my animation is here. Um what you see here in the is here. Um what you see here in the is here. Um what you see here in the middle is basically what we as Semen's middle is basically what we as Semen's middle is basically what we as Semen's product are trying to push and are product are trying to push and are product are trying to push and are somehow little bit responsible in this somehow little bit responsible in this somehow little bit responsible in this ecosystem. But um yeah as I said we can ecosystem. But um yeah as I said we can ecosystem. But um yeah as I said we can just talk about every box for for ages. just talk about every box for for ages. just talk about every box for for ages. Um it should not be the part the the Um it should not be the part the the Um it should not be the part the the duty of a emergency response team to um duty of a emergency response team to um duty of a emergency response team to um do product mapping. So we as a society, do product mapping. So we as a society, do product mapping. So we as a society, we as a economy need to somehow improve we as a economy need to somehow improve we as a economy need to somehow improve on naming things and talking about the on naming things and talking about the on naming things and talking about the same things with the same names. And uh same things with the same names. And uh same things with the same names. And uh what's maybe also important to notice what's maybe also important to notice what's maybe also important to notice here, we need transparency. So in some here, we need transparency. So in some here, we need transparency. So in some places we need to centrally collect data places we need to centrally collect data places we need to centrally collect data about vulnerabilities. And this is why about vulnerabilities. And this is why about vulnerabilities. And this is why we've got central components actually in we've got central components actually in we've got central components actually in that overall workflow. So seaman's pert that overall workflow. So seaman's pert that overall workflow. So seaman's pert vulnerability intelligence also the asp vulnerability intelligence also the asp vulnerability intelligence also the asp database where all the necessary database where all the necessary database where all the necessary information all over the place all information all over the place all information all over the place all within seammens is actually being stored within seammens is actually being stored within seammens is actually being stored and uh if you look then on the left side and uh if you look then on the left side and uh if you look then on the left side here we've got multiple scanners of here we've got multiple scanners of here we've got multiple scanners of course you need multiple scanners course you need multiple scanners course you need multiple scanners because you've got different projects because you've got different projects because you've got different projects different uh yeah programming languages different uh yeah programming languages different uh yeah programming languages different environments and at the moment different environments and at the moment different environments and at the moment we also have different vulnerability we also have different vulnerability we also have different vulnerability tracking systems however yeah tracking systems however yeah tracking systems however yeah consolidation would be needed there as consolidation would be needed there as consolidation would be needed there as well so we face quite a lot of well so we face quite a lot of well so we face quite a lot of challenges in the card here. Before you challenges in the card here. Before you challenges in the card here. Before you before you go into the limitations, before you go into the limitations, before you go into the limitations, maybe let let me add it is of utterly maybe let let me add it is of utterly maybe let let me add it is of utterly importance that we use the same importance that we use the same importance that we use the same vulnerability intelligence data along vulnerability intelligence data along vulnerability intelligence data along the entire supply chain so that the entire supply chain so that the entire supply chain so that basically the same information is basically the same information is basically the same information is flowing from satl to the airport flowing from satl to the airport flowing from satl to the airport operator and we try to work in that operator and we try to work in that operator and we try to work in that direction. direction. direction. Okay. So yeah, component mapping um yeah Okay. So yeah, component mapping um yeah Okay. So yeah, component mapping um yeah it's it's it's it's really still a it's it's it's it's really still a it's it's it's it's really still a problem for environments without package problem for environments without package problem for environments without package manager. So we we want to go into the manager. So we we want to go into the manager. So we we want to go into the direction of using package managers for direction of using package managers for direction of using package managers for almost everything. However, that's only almost everything. However, that's only almost everything. However, that's only possible for green field projects. So so possible for green field projects. So so possible for green field projects. So so the new projects, the modern projects, the new projects, the modern projects, the new projects, the modern projects, modern DevOps projects. If you look at modern DevOps projects. If you look at modern DevOps projects. If you look at so-called brownfield projects, so we've so-called brownfield projects, so we've so-called brownfield projects, so we've got products around there that are 30 got products around there that are 30 got products around there that are 30 years of age. So the first line of code years of age. So the first line of code years of age. So the first line of code maybe was being written 35 years ago. So maybe was being written 35 years ago. So maybe was being written 35 years ago. So so no chance actually that we will be so no chance actually that we will be so no chance actually that we will be introducing any kind of package introducing any kind of package introducing any kind of package management in those uh systems. So, so management in those uh systems. So, so management in those uh systems. So, so uh yeah, we only can make the the the uh yeah, we only can make the the the uh yeah, we only can make the the the future better in that regard here future better in that regard here future better in that regard here actually. Second part. So, so uh yeah, actually. Second part. So, so uh yeah, actually. Second part. So, so uh yeah, duplicate vulnerability notifications duplicate vulnerability notifications duplicate vulnerability notifications actually. So, so if you if you look at actually. So, so if you if you look at actually. So, so if you if you look at that whole graph here, so we've got that whole graph here, so we've got that whole graph here, so we've got vulnerability intelligence providing vulnerability intelligence providing vulnerability intelligence providing information about new vulnerabilities. information about new vulnerabilities. information about new vulnerabilities. We've got a lot of different We've got a lot of different We've got a lot of different vulnerability scanners providing uh yeah vulnerability scanners providing uh yeah vulnerability scanners providing uh yeah information about new vulnerabilities. information about new vulnerabilities. information about new vulnerabilities. So, you need to make sure that you don't So, you need to make sure that you don't So, you need to make sure that you don't get duplicates from those both sides get duplicates from those both sides get duplicates from those both sides actually here. So, that's also a actually here. So, that's also a actually here. So, that's also a challenge. But one one solution might be challenge. But one one solution might be challenge. But one one solution might be and is currently being tested is and is currently being tested is and is currently being tested is actually adapting the sbomb. So so we've actually adapting the sbomb. So so we've actually adapting the sbomb. So so we've got a specific sbomb then for got a specific sbomb then for got a specific sbomb then for vulnerability management where only the vulnerability management where only the vulnerability management where only the necessary components are contained in necessary components are contained in necessary components are contained in and all the components are being left and all the components are being left and all the components are being left out that are already be being covered by out that are already be being covered by out that are already be being covered by vulnerability scanners inside a certain vulnerability scanners inside a certain vulnerability scanners inside a certain project. So this is highly project project. So this is highly project project. So this is highly project specific. Maybe to add on that try to specific. Maybe to add on that try to specific. Maybe to add on that try to see the sbomb as kind of a routing see the sbomb as kind of a routing see the sbomb as kind of a routing mechanism. When we find a vulnerability mechanism. When we find a vulnerability mechanism. When we find a vulnerability in a scanner, we want to see what is the in a scanner, we want to see what is the in a scanner, we want to see what is the affected scope and ask the right people affected scope and ask the right people affected scope and ask the right people because if we have kind of asset because if we have kind of asset because if we have kind of asset responsible operators, they don't know responsible operators, they don't know responsible operators, they don't know about the products that they're using. about the products that they're using. about the products that they're using. So the product people should be asked so So the product people should be asked so So the product people should be asked so that the operators can then use and that the operators can then use and that the operators can then use and leverage that leverage that leverage that information. Next one I already talked information. Next one I already talked information. Next one I already talked about that transparency of rated about that transparency of rated about that transparency of rated vulnerabilities and especially to store all of the store all especially to store all of the store all especially to store all of the store all of the data. of the data. of the data. Next item. So intro forwarding of Next item. So intro forwarding of Next item. So intro forwarding of internal vulnerabilities with that internal vulnerabilities with that internal vulnerabilities with that internal vulnerability DP. I already internal vulnerability DP. I already internal vulnerability DP. I already explained that in regards to that linear explained that in regards to that linear explained that in regards to that linear supply chain I showed in one of the supply chain I showed in one of the supply chain I showed in one of the previous slides here. Very very previous slides here. Very very previous slides here. Very very important actually because else we will important actually because else we will important actually because else we will forget vulnerabilities and we do not forget vulnerabilities and we do not forget vulnerabilities and we do not want that to happen. And then um um yeah the CV happen. And then um um yeah the CV happen. And then um um yeah the CV database uh that's your database uh that's your database uh that's your part. Yeah, exactly. I complain about part. Yeah, exactly. I complain about part. Yeah, exactly. I complain about this a lot. So um now you see why this this a lot. So um now you see why this this a lot. So um now you see why this is basically a struggle for us and uh the third party vulnerability and uh the third party vulnerability and uh the third party vulnerability scanners yeah that they need to have scanners yeah that they need to have scanners yeah that they need to have adequate uh coverage of your adequate uh coverage of your adequate uh coverage of your vulnerabilities. So so on the one side vulnerabilities. So so on the one side vulnerabilities. So so on the one side you need to ensure that you do not have you need to ensure that you do not have you need to ensure that you do not have duplicates actually inside the whole duplicates actually inside the whole duplicates actually inside the whole workflow on the other side you should workflow on the other side you should workflow on the other side you should ensure that you do not have any kind of ensure that you do not have any kind of ensure that you do not have any kind of gaps uh here as well. So, so uh quite a gaps uh here as well. So, so uh quite a gaps uh here as well. So, so uh quite a lot of work on the side of the project, lot of work on the side of the project, lot of work on the side of the project, but as said that's very project specific but as said that's very project specific but as said that's very project specific how that's going to be handled and how how that's going to be handled and how how that's going to be handled and how it's going to be it's going to be it's going to be configured. So that's it. Thanks for configured. So that's it. Thanks for configured. So that's it. Thanks for your attention. Right. Thanks for the presentation. So Right. Thanks for the presentation. So Right. Thanks for the presentation. So we have about four minutes that we can we have about four minutes that we can we have about four minutes that we can do a little bit of Q&amp;A here in the room. do a little bit of Q&amp;A here in the room. do a little bit of Q&amp;A here in the room. So, I will uh I think we're gonna have So, I will uh I think we're gonna have So, I will uh I think we're gonna have more questions than we have time. So, more questions than we have time. So, more questions than we have time. So, I'm literally Excuse me. I'm just going I'm literally Excuse me. I'm just going I'm literally Excuse me. I'm just going to go to the humans that are closest to to go to the humans that are closest to to go to the humans that are closest to me in know. Oh, okay. Well, now the me in know. Oh, okay. Well, now the me in know. Oh, okay. Well, now the speaker pointed somebody out. Oh, he's speaker pointed somebody out. Oh, he's speaker pointed somebody out. Oh, he's got a mic. Oh, you gave him a mic. All got a mic. Oh, you gave him a mic. All got a mic. Oh, you gave him a mic. All right. You do that one first and then right. You do that one first and then right. You do that one first and then we'll ask your question. Go ahead. Hi. we'll ask your question. Go ahead. Hi. we'll ask your question. Go ahead. Hi. Um, thank you for the presentation. Uh, Um, thank you for the presentation. Uh, Um, thank you for the presentation. Uh, really good. Really, um, just have a really good. Really, um, just have a really good. Really, um, just have a question. You mentioned the fact you question. You mentioned the fact you question. You mentioned the fact you make the link between your sbomb let's make the link between your sbomb let's make the link between your sbomb let's say catalog and vulnerability say catalog and vulnerability say catalog and vulnerability intelligence and you mentioned the fact intelligence and you mentioned the fact intelligence and you mentioned the fact as well like you have the vulnerability as well like you have the vulnerability as well like you have the vulnerability scanners which is more or less link with scanners which is more or less link with scanners which is more or less link with in all this you know in all this you know in all this you know power I mean how do you make this link power I mean how do you make this link power I mean how do you make this link what I mean by that is like what I see what I mean by that is like what I see what I mean by that is like what I see is sbomb catalog when you are using is sbomb catalog when you are using is sbomb catalog when you are using scanners they are not really use this scanners they are not really use this scanners they are not really use this one some are using you CP and one some are using you CP and one some are using you CP and vulnerability intelligence. It's exactly vulnerability intelligence. It's exactly vulnerability intelligence. It's exactly the same. The main vulnerability the same. The main vulnerability the same. The main vulnerability intelligence database are related to CP intelligence database are related to CP intelligence database are related to CP not to SBOM. So how do you really make not to SBOM. So how do you really make not to SBOM. So how do you really make the link between ESBOM vulnerability the link between ESBOM vulnerability the link between ESBOM vulnerability intelligence and what you get from the intelligence and what you get from the intelligence and what you get from the scanners? So glad you asked that scanners? So glad you asked that scanners? So glad you asked that question and this is basically a major question and this is basically a major question and this is basically a major pain point for us. So if you're a pain point for us. So if you're a pain point for us. So if you're a vulnerability vendor then please talk to vulnerability vendor then please talk to vulnerability vendor then please talk to us because kind of what we see right now us because kind of what we see right now us because kind of what we see right now is that the vulnerability scanners is that the vulnerability scanners is that the vulnerability scanners basically find a lot of vulnerabilities basically find a lot of vulnerabilities basically find a lot of vulnerabilities in upstream components but kind of as in upstream components but kind of as in upstream components but kind of as the level of operations this might be the level of operations this might be the level of operations this might be duplicates this might be something that duplicates this might be something that duplicates this might be something that the uh product teams have already looked the uh product teams have already looked the uh product teams have already looked at but due to our inability to basically at but due to our inability to basically at but due to our inability to basically have a common ecosystem to transfer that have a common ecosystem to transfer that have a common ecosystem to transfer that data to the scanners in more than kind data to the scanners in more than kind data to the scanners in more than kind of private programs where we talk to of private programs where we talk to of private programs where we talk to each scanner vendor individually. This each scanner vendor individually. This each scanner vendor individually. This is a missing gap and this is basically is a missing gap and this is basically is a missing gap and this is basically the punchline of this talk. Um uh so I have two really fast Um uh so I have two really fast Um uh so I have two really fast questions. Hi, I work at uh we work at questions. Hi, I work at uh we work at questions. Hi, I work at uh we work at Cisco on the exact equivalent of your Cisco on the exact equivalent of your Cisco on the exact equivalent of your team and I'd love to talk after this. Um team and I'd love to talk after this. Um team and I'd love to talk after this. Um my really fast uh quick top question is my really fast uh quick top question is my really fast uh quick top question is what are your unique identifier fields what are your unique identifier fields what are your unique identifier fields like? So what's a component tupil to like? So what's a component tupil to like? So what's a component tupil to you? And then the second question I have you? And then the second question I have you? And then the second question I have might take a little longer. So the might take a little longer. So the might take a little longer. So the effect of embedding or vendoring in a effect of embedding or vendoring in a effect of embedding or vendoring in a software is not a linear effect on the software is not a linear effect on the software is not a linear effect on the CVSS score. Frequently it can take it CVSS score. Frequently it can take it CVSS score. Frequently it can take it down to zero because it makes it down to zero because it makes it down to zero because it makes it inaccessible or worse it could take it inaccessible or worse it could take it inaccessible or worse it could take it up really high if you chain CVS up really high if you chain CVS up really high if you chain CVS together. So analysis of that is together. So analysis of that is together. So analysis of that is incredibly manual and how do you incredibly manual and how do you incredibly manual and how do you automate or scale some kind of work like automate or scale some kind of work like automate or scale some kind of work like that? Okay. Um so I think that's a that? Okay. Um so I think that's a that? Okay. Um so I think that's a presentation of an entire workshop uh presentation of an entire workshop uh presentation of an entire workshop uh also in one question. So first of the also in one question. So first of the also in one question. So first of the identifiers that's really a major pain identifiers that's really a major pain identifiers that's really a major pain point. We just have to manually uh do point. We just have to manually uh do point. We just have to manually uh do that uh assignment assessment and then that uh assignment assessment and then that uh assignment assessment and then we try to leverage AI to to improve on we try to leverage AI to to improve on we try to leverage AI to to improve on that kind of this is something that that kind of this is something that that kind of this is something that needs to be solved in the needs to be solved in the needs to be solved in the industry. And basically the second industry. And basically the second industry. And basically the second question was question was question was about ah CV so I'm going to take that about ah CV so I'm going to take that about ah CV so I'm going to take that over. So so so it's about the risk over. So so so it's about the risk over. So so so it's about the risk evaluation in the end of vulnerabilities evaluation in the end of vulnerabilities evaluation in the end of vulnerabilities over the supply chain and uh what we over the supply chain and uh what we over the supply chain and uh what we found out so so we've got different found out so so we've got different found out so so we've got different project types. So for example embedded project types. So for example embedded project types. So for example embedded devices for them it's really important devices for them it's really important devices for them it's really important to evaluate each and every to evaluate each and every to evaluate each and every vulnerabilities so that they can decide vulnerabilities so that they can decide vulnerabilities so that they can decide whether they invest the money to to to whether they invest the money to to to whether they invest the money to to to create a patch for that system and that create a patch for that system and that create a patch for that system and that cost costs a lot of money actually. So cost costs a lot of money actually. So cost costs a lot of money actually. So they really want to be sure that all of they really want to be sure that all of they really want to be sure that all of those vulner certain vulnerabilities those vulner certain vulnerabilities those vulner certain vulnerabilities applicable so that they have a good applicable so that they have a good applicable so that they have a good decision actually to invest all of that decision actually to invest all of that decision actually to invest all of that money that's one part hard to automate money that's one part hard to automate money that's one part hard to automate to be honest because you need experts to be honest because you need experts to be honest because you need experts you need to look at it in in depth but you need to look at it in in depth but you need to look at it in in depth but if you look at SAS projects so cloud if you look at SAS projects so cloud if you look at SAS projects so cloud infrastructure usually you you want to infrastructure usually you you want to infrastructure usually you you want to patch everything there so you just patch everything there so you just patch everything there so you just prioritize that's one example here so so prioritize that's one example here so so prioritize that's one example here so so you want to keep all the libraries all you want to keep all the libraries all you want to keep all the libraries all the dependencies up to date and you just the dependencies up to date and you just the dependencies up to date and you just want to prioritize what parts should be want to prioritize what parts should be want to prioritize what parts should be patched first and For those cases, it's patched first and For those cases, it's patched first and For those cases, it's easier to provide automation and to to easier to provide automation and to to easier to provide automation and to to yeah to to in the end prepare the yeah to to in the end prepare the yeah to to in the end prepare the evaluation of the vulnerabilities. And evaluation of the vulnerabilities. And evaluation of the vulnerabilities. And on the other hand, we also have projects on the other hand, we also have projects on the other hand, we also have projects that are actually overwhelmed with that are actually overwhelmed with that are actually overwhelmed with vulnerabilities. And if you have a bulk vulnerabilities. And if you have a bulk vulnerabilities. And if you have a bulk of vulnerabilities and do not know what of vulnerabilities and do not know what of vulnerabilities and do not know what to look at first, a bad thing is to look at first, a bad thing is to look at first, a bad thing is actually to look at everything above actually to look at everything above actually to look at everything above CVSS score nine. it's better to do some CVSS score nine. it's better to do some CVSS score nine. it's better to do some kind of yeah previous evaluation to put kind of yeah previous evaluation to put kind of yeah previous evaluation to put everything into a rough context and then everything into a rough context and then everything into a rough context and then look at those vulnerabilities in detail. look at those vulnerabilities in detail. look at those vulnerabilities in detail. So we've got different project types So we've got different project types So we've got different project types also from uh yeah from yeah the age of also from uh yeah from yeah the age of also from uh yeah from yeah the age of the project and the environment of the the project and the environment of the the project and the environment of the project and it depends on how you solve project and it depends on how you solve project and it depends on how you solve the problem and sometimes it cannot be the problem and sometimes it cannot be the problem and sometimes it cannot be solved. But let me add from a practical solved. But let me add from a practical solved. But let me add from a practical perspective like I say guys we're going perspective like I say guys we're going perspective like I say guys we're going to have to ask you to take this offline to have to ask you to take this offline to have to ask you to take this offline we are over time. Thank you so much we are over time. Thank you so much we are over time. Thank you so much Thomas and Tobias for a great Thomas and Tobias for a great Thomas and Tobias for a great presentation.
