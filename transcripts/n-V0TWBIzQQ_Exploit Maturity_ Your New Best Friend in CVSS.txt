And now that it's a few minutes Discord. And now that it's a few minutes Discord. And now that it's a few minutes after uh after 4:30 and folks have had after uh after 4:30 and folks have had after uh after 4:30 and folks have had time to get settled in, I'm going to get time to get settled in, I'm going to get time to get settled in, I'm going to get started telling you why exploit maturity started telling you why exploit maturity started telling you why exploit maturity is the metric that's going to be your is the metric that's going to be your is the metric that's going to be your new best friend in CBSS 4.0. new best friend in CBSS 4.0. new best friend in CBSS 4.0. Uh, first I'm going to get started with Uh, first I'm going to get started with Uh, first I'm going to get started with a bio and why you should listen to me a bio and why you should listen to me a bio and why you should listen to me when I talk about when I talk about when I talk about CVSS4.0. U, next I'm going to go into CVSS4.0. U, next I'm going to go into CVSS4.0. U, next I'm going to go into CVSS3.1 versus 4.0 a little bit, but CVSS3.1 versus 4.0 a little bit, but CVSS3.1 versus 4.0 a little bit, but because there have been a lot of CVSS4.0 because there have been a lot of CVSS4.0 because there have been a lot of CVSS4.0 talks today and people have gone over talks today and people have gone over talks today and people have gone over CVSS3.1 versus 4.0 over and over again, CVSS3.1 versus 4.0 over and over again, CVSS3.1 versus 4.0 over and over again, I'm I'm going to try to keep that part I'm I'm going to try to keep that part I'm I'm going to try to keep that part brief. Uh I'm going to talk a little bit brief. Uh I'm going to talk a little bit brief. Uh I'm going to talk a little bit about what the exploit maturity metric about what the exploit maturity metric about what the exploit maturity metric is, specifically the exploit maturity is, specifically the exploit maturity is, specifically the exploit maturity metric in metric in metric in CVSS4.0. Uh I'm going to talk about two CVSS4.0. Uh I'm going to talk about two CVSS4.0. Uh I'm going to talk about two cases where you can use exploit maturity cases where you can use exploit maturity cases where you can use exploit maturity to improve the quality of your records. to improve the quality of your records. to improve the quality of your records. Uh those scenarios are correcting Uh those scenarios are correcting Uh those scenarios are correcting overcoring that tends to happen in CVSS overcoring that tends to happen in CVSS overcoring that tends to happen in CVSS Ford auto and um and to improve the Ford auto and um and to improve the Ford auto and um and to improve the record by including information about record by including information about record by including information about the exploit status right in the CVS the exploit status right in the CVS the exploit status right in the CVS record with no other information record with no other information record with no other information necessary. All right. Who am I? Why necessary. All right. Who am I? Why necessary. All right. Who am I? Why should you listen to me whenever I talk should you listen to me whenever I talk should you listen to me whenever I talk to you about CVSS 4.0? Um, as someone to you about CVSS 4.0? Um, as someone to you about CVSS 4.0? Um, as someone who works on GitHub's advisory database, who works on GitHub's advisory database, who works on GitHub's advisory database, I have to curate a lot of CVE records in I have to curate a lot of CVE records in I have to curate a lot of CVE records in order to generate the information that order to generate the information that order to generate the information that leads to dependabot alerts. So, as a leads to dependabot alerts. So, as a leads to dependabot alerts. So, as a result, I see a lot of CVSS scores. I result, I see a lot of CVSS scores. I result, I see a lot of CVSS scores. I see a lot of CVSS3.1 scores. I see a lot see a lot of CVSS3.1 scores. I see a lot see a lot of CVSS3.1 scores. I see a lot of CVSS4.0 scores. I see myself of CVSS4.0 scores. I see myself of CVSS4.0 scores. I see myself comparing them a lot of the time and comparing them a lot of the time and comparing them a lot of the time and thinking, could this be better? And thinking, could this be better? And thinking, could this be better? And which CNAs seem to be engaging in which which CNAs seem to be engaging in which which CNAs seem to be engaging in which practices? I see a lot of other people's practices? I see a lot of other people's practices? I see a lot of other people's CBSS scores, but as part of my duties on CBSS scores, but as part of my duties on CBSS scores, but as part of my duties on the GitHub advisory curation team, uh I the GitHub advisory curation team, uh I the GitHub advisory curation team, uh I also do tasks related to GitHub's duties also do tasks related to GitHub's duties also do tasks related to GitHub's duties as a CNA. Uh, one of the services that as a CNA. Uh, one of the services that as a CNA. Uh, one of the services that we provide as a CNA is that when we provide as a CNA is that when we provide as a CNA is that when maintainers who use GitHub's CVE request maintainers who use GitHub's CVE request maintainers who use GitHub's CVE request feature don't want to score a CVSS or feature don't want to score a CVSS or feature don't want to score a CVSS or they don't know how to, that is they don't know how to, that is they don't know how to, that is something that we will do for them something that we will do for them something that we will do for them before submitting the CVE record to the before submitting the CVE record to the before submitting the CVE record to the CVE list. So I find myself having to CVE list. So I find myself having to CVE list. So I find myself having to score a lot of CVSS's for a lot of other score a lot of CVSS's for a lot of other score a lot of CVSS's for a lot of other people's products and I have to consider people's products and I have to consider people's products and I have to consider what have other CNAs done, what would what have other CNAs done, what would what have other CNAs done, what would the maintainer want, what does the the maintainer want, what does the the maintainer want, what does the downstream consumer want to see. So downstream consumer want to see. So downstream consumer want to see. So these are all things I have to take into these are all things I have to take into these are all things I have to take into account whenever I'm doing a CVSS score. account whenever I'm doing a CVSS score. account whenever I'm doing a CVSS score. And I've seen situations where exploit And I've seen situations where exploit And I've seen situations where exploit maturity helps maintainers get their maturity helps maintainers get their maturity helps maintainers get their message across about how serious a message across about how serious a message across about how serious a particular vulnerability is, which is particular vulnerability is, which is particular vulnerability is, which is why I like exploit maturity. And I will move on a little bit to And I will move on a little bit to And I will move on a little bit to discuss what I am planning to cover and discuss what I am planning to cover and discuss what I am planning to cover and what I am not planning to cover. I am what I am not planning to cover. I am what I am not planning to cover. I am planning to cover specifically what the planning to cover specifically what the planning to cover specifically what the exploit maturity metric is. That is the exploit maturity metric is. That is the exploit maturity metric is. That is the exploit maturity metric in exploit maturity metric in exploit maturity metric in CVSS4.0. There is a metric called CVSS4.0. There is a metric called CVSS4.0. There is a metric called exploit code maturity in CVSS3.1. exploit code maturity in CVSS3.1. exploit code maturity in CVSS3.1. uh that is a little bit different and I uh that is a little bit different and I uh that is a little bit different and I am not going to talk about exploit code am not going to talk about exploit code am not going to talk about exploit code maturity from maturity from maturity from CVSS3.1 because it doesn't have the same CVSS3.1 because it doesn't have the same CVSS3.1 because it doesn't have the same impact on a CVSs that exploit maturity impact on a CVSs that exploit maturity impact on a CVSs that exploit maturity has on CVSS has on CVSS has on CVSS 4.0 and I'm going to talk about 4.0 and I'm going to talk about 4.0 and I'm going to talk about situations in which the exploit maturity situations in which the exploit maturity situations in which the exploit maturity metric is useful. I called this exploit metric is useful. I called this exploit metric is useful. I called this exploit maturity is your new best friend in maturity is your new best friend in maturity is your new best friend in CVSS. So, I'm going to be a little bit CVSS. So, I'm going to be a little bit CVSS. So, I'm going to be a little bit biased in favor of situations where biased in favor of situations where biased in favor of situations where exploit maturity is good because I like exploit maturity is good because I like exploit maturity is good because I like to use it. to use it. to use it. Um, particularly this is going to be Um, particularly this is going to be Um, particularly this is going to be issues that someone may encounter when issues that someone may encounter when issues that someone may encounter when they're using CVSS for auto and being they're using CVSS for auto and being they're using CVSS for auto and being able to lead someone to a more accurate able to lead someone to a more accurate able to lead someone to a more accurate result or something that they're happier result or something that they're happier result or something that they're happier with. whenever you're using exploit with. whenever you're using exploit with. whenever you're using exploit maturity. Uh the talk is not about maturity. Uh the talk is not about maturity. Uh the talk is not about CVSS3.1 versus CVSS 4.0 in general. Uh CVSS3.1 versus CVSS 4.0 in general. Uh CVSS3.1 versus CVSS 4.0 in general. Uh if you have been in room 8 today, you if you have been in room 8 today, you if you have been in room 8 today, you have seen those talks over and over and have seen those talks over and over and have seen those talks over and over and over again. And everyone would probably over again. And everyone would probably over again. And everyone would probably be very mad at me if I did that for the be very mad at me if I did that for the be very mad at me if I did that for the I think fifth time. um CVSS auto in I think fifth time. um CVSS auto in I think fifth time. um CVSS auto in general also there there are other talks general also there there are other talks general also there there are other talks today that went over CVSS auto in today that went over CVSS auto in today that went over CVSS auto in general and they were great talks but uh general and they were great talks but uh general and they were great talks but uh but I should not be repeating the work but I should not be repeating the work but I should not be repeating the work that has already been done today and uh that has already been done today and uh that has already been done today and uh I am not going to go into exploit code I am not going to go into exploit code I am not going to go into exploit code maturity in maturity in maturity in CVSS3.1 this is specifically about if CVSS3.1 this is specifically about if CVSS3.1 this is specifically about if you are going to use you are going to use you are going to use CVSS4.0 and mostly issues specific to CVSS4.0 and mostly issues specific to CVSS4.0 and mostly issues specific to CVSS4.0 With those groundwork laid out, what is With those groundwork laid out, what is With those groundwork laid out, what is exploit maturity? Uh to quote the first exploit maturity? Uh to quote the first exploit maturity? Uh to quote the first documentation about what exploit documentation about what exploit documentation about what exploit maturity maturity maturity is, this metric measures the likelihood is, this metric measures the likelihood is, this metric measures the likelihood of the vulnerability being attacked and of the vulnerability being attacked and of the vulnerability being attacked and is based on the current state of exploit is based on the current state of exploit is based on the current state of exploit techniques, exploit code availability or techniques, exploit code availability or techniques, exploit code availability or active in the wild exploitation. active in the wild exploitation. active in the wild exploitation. Whenever you see exploit maturity being Whenever you see exploit maturity being Whenever you see exploit maturity being used, the shorthand symbol is the letter used, the shorthand symbol is the letter used, the shorthand symbol is the letter E. Uh we're going to see the letter E E. Uh we're going to see the letter E E. Uh we're going to see the letter E pop up a fair bit in this talk. And pop up a fair bit in this talk. And pop up a fair bit in this talk. And specifically, it's the only metric in specifically, it's the only metric in specifically, it's the only metric in CVSS4.0's threat metrics category, which CVSS4.0's threat metrics category, which CVSS4.0's threat metrics category, which makes it a little different from base makes it a little different from base makes it a little different from base score environmental metrics, uh what score environmental metrics, uh what score environmental metrics, uh what were called temporal metrics in CVSS3.1 were called temporal metrics in CVSS3.1 were called temporal metrics in CVSS3.1 and so on. Um it's unique because it's and so on. Um it's unique because it's and so on. Um it's unique because it's in its own category. Uh it has three in its own category. Uh it has three in its own category. Uh it has three levels of severity that I put in order levels of severity that I put in order levels of severity that I put in order of most bad to least bad. Most bad is of most bad to least bad. Most bad is of most bad to least bad. Most bad is attacked. Um proof of concept is middle attacked. Um proof of concept is middle attacked. Um proof of concept is middle bad kind of sort of bad. Um and the bad kind of sort of bad. Um and the bad kind of sort of bad. Um and the unreported level is the least bad. Uh in unreported level is the least bad. Uh in unreported level is the least bad. Uh in general, you're going to want things to general, you're going to want things to general, you're going to want things to uh to be less bad when it come when uh to be less bad when it come when uh to be less bad when it come when possible. We don't always have control possible. We don't always have control possible. We don't always have control over the amount of badness in the world, over the amount of badness in the world, over the amount of badness in the world, but you know, in general, we like things but you know, in general, we like things but you know, in general, we like things to be less bad if possible. Um, attacked to be less bad if possible. Um, attacked to be less bad if possible. Um, attacked means that the vulnerability has been means that the vulnerability has been means that the vulnerability has been exploited in the wild. Uh, that is why exploited in the wild. Uh, that is why exploited in the wild. Uh, that is why that is the most bad. We do not like it that is the most bad. We do not like it that is the most bad. We do not like it when things get attacked or exploited in when things get attacked or exploited in when things get attacked or exploited in the wild. That makes us sad. Um, proof the wild. That makes us sad. Um, proof the wild. That makes us sad. Um, proof of concept is less bad. That means a of concept is less bad. That means a of concept is less bad. That means a publicly available proof of concept publicly available proof of concept publicly available proof of concept exists, but there's no proof of exists, but there's no proof of exists, but there's no proof of exploitation occurring in the wild. Uh, exploitation occurring in the wild. Uh, exploitation occurring in the wild. Uh, unreported is the least bad. That could unreported is the least bad. That could unreported is the least bad. That could be a score from a claim as low as be a score from a claim as low as be a score from a claim as low as there's a vulnerability. Just trust me. there's a vulnerability. Just trust me. there's a vulnerability. Just trust me. Um, but unreported means you there's not Um, but unreported means you there's not Um, but unreported means you there's not a public knowledge of a proof of a public knowledge of a proof of a public knowledge of a proof of concept. There's no public knowledge of concept. There's no public knowledge of concept. There's no public knowledge of exploitation attempts and that's the exploitation attempts and that's the exploitation attempts and that's the least likely to be exploited and and the least likely to be exploited and and the least likely to be exploited and and the furthest from being furthest from being furthest from being exploited. Uh what are some of the exploited. Uh what are some of the exploited. Uh what are some of the problems that we could use this metric problems that we could use this metric problems that we could use this metric with its three lovely levels for? I am with its three lovely levels for? I am with its three lovely levels for? I am glad you glad you glad you asked. There is a problem with asked. There is a problem with asked. There is a problem with vulnerability overscoring. what some vulnerability overscoring. what some vulnerability overscoring. what some people feel is vulnerability overcoring people feel is vulnerability overcoring people feel is vulnerability overcoring in CVSS 4.0 compared to CVSS 3.1. Uh in CVSS 4.0 compared to CVSS 3.1. Uh in CVSS 4.0 compared to CVSS 3.1. Uh that means there are going to be more that means there are going to be more that means there are going to be more critical and high vulnerabilities. And critical and high vulnerabilities. And critical and high vulnerabilities. And because there are many many orgs that because there are many many orgs that because there are many many orgs that deal with critical and high deal with critical and high deal with critical and high vulnerabilities in certain ways vulnerabilities in certain ways vulnerabilities in certain ways according to their policies, they have according to their policies, they have according to their policies, they have to move quickly to act on those to move quickly to act on those to move quickly to act on those vulnerabilities. And that can increase vulnerabilities. And that can increase vulnerabilities. And that can increase the risk of alert fatigue if all of a the risk of alert fatigue if all of a the risk of alert fatigue if all of a sudden you are dealing with a lot of sudden you are dealing with a lot of sudden you are dealing with a lot of critical vulnerabilities and a lot of critical vulnerabilities and a lot of critical vulnerabilities and a lot of high vulnerabilities when all that's high vulnerabilities when all that's high vulnerabilities when all that's really changed about the vulnerabilities really changed about the vulnerabilities really changed about the vulnerabilities is the scoring system that's used about is the scoring system that's used about is the scoring system that's used about them. Um in fact there is a specific them. Um in fact there is a specific them. Um in fact there is a specific post that uh that led me to think about post that uh that led me to think about post that uh that led me to think about how exploit maturity could help with how exploit maturity could help with how exploit maturity could help with this problem and um and it was a post on this problem and um and it was a post on this problem and um and it was a post on mend by Aurora Sterita which is called mend by Aurora Sterita which is called mend by Aurora Sterita which is called CVSS3.1 versus CVSS3.1 versus CVSS3.1 versus CVSS4.0 and look at the data uh and this CVSS4.0 and look at the data uh and this CVSS4.0 and look at the data uh and this is a comparison of CVSS3.1 scores with is a comparison of CVSS3.1 scores with is a comparison of CVSS3.1 scores with similar CVSS4.0 scores which found that similar CVSS4.0 scores which found that similar CVSS4.0 scores which found that CVSS4.0 scores tended to score higher CVSS4.0 scores tended to score higher CVSS4.0 scores tended to score higher for similar vulnerabilities compared to for similar vulnerabilities compared to for similar vulnerabilities compared to CVSS 3.1. Um the quotes that str that CVSS 3.1. Um the quotes that str that CVSS 3.1. Um the quotes that str that stuck out to me the most were the stuck out to me the most were the stuck out to me the most were the average increase across all of the CVSS average increase across all of the CVSS average increase across all of the CVSS scores in customer alerts went up by scores in customer alerts went up by scores in customer alerts went up by nearly 0.8 that is a 0.8 eight point nearly 0.8 that is a 0.8 eight point nearly 0.8 that is a 0.8 eight point that is almost one which resulted in 27% that is almost one which resulted in 27% that is almost one which resulted in 27% more critical severity alerts and 18% more critical severity alerts and 18% more critical severity alerts and 18% more high severity alerts more high severity alerts more high severity alerts um which could be which on its own can um which could be which on its own can um which could be which on its own can be quite a lot be quite a lot be quite a lot but it was large enough to move a large but it was large enough to move a large but it was large enough to move a large number of CVEes over the line into the number of CVEes over the line into the number of CVEes over the line into the next severity level. Uh, in case you are next severity level. Uh, in case you are next severity level. Uh, in case you are not able to read this chart on the not able to read this chart on the not able to read this chart on the screen, there is a there's a text box on screen, there is a there's a text box on screen, there is a there's a text box on the top that says CBSS 3.1 versus 4.0 in the top that says CBSS 3.1 versus 4.0 in the top that says CBSS 3.1 versus 4.0 in men.io customer alerts. Um, the darker men.io customer alerts. Um, the darker men.io customer alerts. Um, the darker blue box on the top is CVSS 3.1. The blue box on the top is CVSS 3.1. The blue box on the top is CVSS 3.1. The lighter blue box on the bottom is CVSS lighter blue box on the bottom is CVSS lighter blue box on the bottom is CVSS 4.0. Uh, it goes from critical on the 4.0.

Those are a couple of situations where Those are a couple of situations where Those are a couple of situations where you can help calm people down a little you can help calm people down a little you can help calm people down a little bit by saying, "Hey, this hasn't been bit by saying, "Hey, this hasn't been bit by saying, "Hey, this hasn't been exploited in the wild." Very few exploited in the wild." Very few exploited in the wild." Very few vulnerabilities in the grand scheme of vulnerabilities in the grand scheme of vulnerabilities in the grand scheme of things have solid proof of being things have solid proof of being things have solid proof of being exploited in the wild. But um but this exploited in the wild. But um but this exploited in the wild. But um but this helps to assess the downstream helps to assess the downstream helps to assess the downstream consumer's expectations of how serious consumer's expectations of how serious consumer's expectations of how serious this is based in part on whether it's this is based in part on whether it's this is based in part on whether it's been exploited in the wild. That that's been exploited in the wild. That that's been exploited in the wild. That that's something that's really nice and something that's really nice and something that's really nice and reassuring that you can say there's no reassuring that you can say there's no reassuring that you can say there's no proof of exploitation in the wild and or proof of exploitation in the wild and or proof of exploitation in the wild and or there's proof of concept code out there. there's proof of concept code out there. there's proof of concept code out there. You can go replicate it yourself if you You can go replicate it yourself if you You can go replicate it yourself if you want. But you know there's no evidence want. But you know there's no evidence want. But you know there's no evidence of thread actors actually using this of thread actors actually using this of thread actors actually using this vulnerability. vulnerability. vulnerability. But Shelby, I hear you all ask, there But Shelby, I hear you all ask, there But Shelby, I hear you all ask, there are those situations where are those situations where are those situations where vulnerabilities actually have been vulnerabilities actually have been vulnerabilities actually have been exploited in the wild. And that's pretty exploited in the wild. And that's pretty exploited in the wild. And that's pretty serious. Shouldn't we be talking about serious. Shouldn't we be talking about serious. Shouldn't we be talking about those situations where people actually those situations where people actually those situations where people actually want to say this is serious because this want to say this is serious because this want to say this is serious because this vulnerability has been exploited in the vulnerability has been exploited in the vulnerability has been exploited in the wild? And oh boy, oh boy, I am glad that wild? And oh boy, oh boy, I am glad that wild? And oh boy, oh boy, I am glad that you asked because there are so many you asked because there are so many you asked because there are so many lovely wonderful things that you can use lovely wonderful things that you can use lovely wonderful things that you can use to warn people that a vulnerability has to warn people that a vulnerability has to warn people that a vulnerability has been exploited in the wild. You can use been exploited in the wild. You can use been exploited in the wild. You can use the known exploited vulnerabilities the known exploited vulnerabilities the known exploited vulnerabilities database. They're pretty trustworthy. database. They're pretty trustworthy. database. They're pretty trustworthy. They if something's on KEV, you know They if something's on KEV, you know They if something's on KEV, you know it's been exploited. Uh if you don't it's been exploited. Uh if you don't it's been exploited. Uh if you don't want to go quite as far as KEV, there is want to go quite as far as KEV, there is want to go quite as far as KEV, there is EPSS, which is also a lovely tool and EPSS, which is also a lovely tool and EPSS, which is also a lovely tool and which also has folks talking about it at which also has folks talking about it at which also has folks talking about it at this fine conference. Um in which past this fine conference. Um in which past this fine conference. Um in which past exploitation can be a factor in EPSS exploitation can be a factor in EPSS exploitation can be a factor in EPSS scoring. Um, but past exploitation is scoring. Um, but past exploitation is scoring. Um, but past exploitation is not the only factor when it comes to not the only factor when it comes to not the only factor when it comes to EPSS or or you can put evidence of EPSS or or you can put evidence of EPSS or or you can put evidence of exploitation or whether or not exploitation or whether or not exploitation or whether or not something's been exploited before right something's been exploited before right something's been exploited before right in the CVSs and you don't need any other in the CVSs and you don't need any other in the CVSs and you don't need any other scores or numbers in the record, just scores or numbers in the record, just scores or numbers in the record, just that that that CVSS. Uh, and in fact, this was CVSS. Uh, and in fact, this was CVSS. Uh, and in fact, this was something that I did when I helped a something that I did when I helped a something that I did when I helped a maintainer who was concerned about the maintainer who was concerned about the maintainer who was concerned about the use of use of use of CVSS3.1 for their product. Um, this was CVSS3.1 for their product. Um, this was CVSS3.1 for their product. Um, this was someone who came to us in the public someone who came to us in the public someone who came to us in the public advisory database repo because a advisory database repo because a advisory database repo because a vulnerability that they had some vulnerability that they had some vulnerability that they had some concerns about actually was exploited in concerns about actually was exploited in concerns about actually was exploited in the wild um the wild um the wild um to to the tune of, you know, of some to to the tune of, you know, of some to to the tune of, you know, of some pretty serious consequences. And they pretty serious consequences. And they pretty serious consequences. And they were concerned that the CBSS 3.1 uh did were concerned that the CBSS 3.1 uh did were concerned that the CBSS 3.1 uh did not adequately describe how serious this not adequately describe how serious this not adequately describe how serious this situation actually was. Uh CBSS situation actually was. Uh CBSS situation actually was. Uh CBSS uh 4.0 auto ended up being the right uh 4.0 auto ended up being the right uh 4.0 auto ended up being the right solution for them for a couple of solution for them for a couple of solution for them for a couple of reasons and I went through the process reasons and I went through the process reasons and I went through the process of rescoring the vulnerability with of rescoring the vulnerability with of rescoring the vulnerability with them. uh first trying with them. uh first trying with them. uh first trying with CBSS3.1. Um I tried rescoring with CBSS3.1. Um I tried rescoring with CBSS3.1. Um I tried rescoring with CBSS3.1, but if I just tried what they CBSS3.1, but if I just tried what they CBSS3.1, but if I just tried what they suggested, you know, one of the things suggested, you know, one of the things suggested, you know, one of the things they said was this vulnerability can they said was this vulnerability can they said was this vulnerability can break something. Okay. Um bricking is break something. Okay. Um bricking is break something. Okay. Um bricking is pretty serious. That sounds like a high pretty serious. That sounds like a high pretty serious. That sounds like a high availability issue. But, you know, after availability issue. But, you know, after availability issue. But, you know, after everything they told me, the highest I everything they told me, the highest I everything they told me, the highest I could still get it to was from 6.5 could still get it to was from 6.5 could still get it to was from 6.5 medium to 8.7 or high. And that was medium to 8.7 or high. And that was medium to 8.7 or high. And that was serious enough. They they weren't happy serious enough. They they weren't happy serious enough. They they weren't happy with just high like with um with the with just high like with um with the with just high like with um with the seriousness of the attack and the losses seriousness of the attack and the losses seriousness of the attack and the losses involved. Um critical really felt more involved. Um critical really felt more involved. Um critical really felt more appropriate to them. I thought well what appropriate to them. I thought well what appropriate to them. I thought well what can we do with CVSS4.0 and with CVSS4.0 there are a CVSS4.0 and with CVSS4.0 there are a CVSS4.0 and with CVSS4.0 there are a couple of important changes not just couple of important changes not just couple of important changes not just exploit maturity. Um, in addition to exploit maturity. Um, in addition to exploit maturity. Um, in addition to adding subsequent system impacts, in adding subsequent system impacts, in adding subsequent system impacts, in addition to vulnerable system impacts addition to vulnerable system impacts addition to vulnerable system impacts and adding and adding and adding E colon A, um, we were able to get the E colon A, um, we were able to get the E colon A, um, we were able to get the CVSS up to 9.1 or critical. CVSS up to 9.1 or critical. CVSS up to 9.1 or critical. And that was actually what made the And that was actually what made the And that was actually what made the maintainers happy because in that score maintainers happy because in that score maintainers happy because in that score this was able to warn them, you know, this was able to warn them, you know, this was able to warn them, you know, both a your device is going to be both a your device is going to be both a your device is going to be bricked and b this has happened in the bricked and b this has happened in the bricked and b this has happened in the wild. We were able to show all of that wild. We were able to show all of that wild. We were able to show all of that information with just the information with just the information with just the CVSS. And in fact, this worked out CVSS. And in fact, this worked out CVSS. And in fact, this worked out pretty well. Uh I'd like to quote myself pretty well. Uh I'd like to quote myself pretty well. Uh I'd like to quote myself because uh I am pretty proud of how I because uh I am pretty proud of how I because uh I am pretty proud of how I handled this situation. though for the handled this situation. though for the handled this situation. though for the for the benefit of those who may not be for the benefit of those who may not be for the benefit of those who may not be able to read the small text and for the able to read the small text and for the able to read the small text and for the benefit of myself who likes to read her benefit of myself who likes to read her benefit of myself who likes to read her own own own words knowing there's an availability words knowing there's an availability words knowing there's an availability impact definitely impacts the score impact definitely impacts the score impact definitely impacts the score breaking constitutes a high impact so I breaking constitutes a high impact so I breaking constitutes a high impact so I think it's appropriate to set the think it's appropriate to set the think it's appropriate to set the availability value to high additionally availability value to high additionally availability value to high additionally I think there's an argument to be made I think there's an argument to be made I think there's an argument to be made for scope change based on the bug not for scope change based on the bug not for scope change based on the bug not just allowing account access but just allowing account access but just allowing account access but allowing xfiltration of money/data from allowing xfiltration of money/data from allowing xfiltration of money/data from one account to another therefore I will one account to another therefore I will one account to another therefore I will correct the CVSS scores to I provided correct the CVSS scores to I provided correct the CVSS scores to I provided 3.1 and 4.0. In this case, CVSS 3.1 is 3.1 and 4.0. In this case, CVSS 3.1 is 3.1 and 4.0. In this case, CVSS 3.1 is still assessed as high, but CVSS 4.0 is still assessed as high, but CVSS 4.0 is still assessed as high, but CVSS 4.0 is assessed as critical. And I think CVSS assessed as critical. And I think CVSS assessed as critical. And I think CVSS 4.0 is a better fit due to having more 4.0 is a better fit due to having more 4.0 is a better fit due to having more specific information about the impact on specific information about the impact on specific information about the impact on vulnerable versus subsequent systems and vulnerable versus subsequent systems and vulnerable versus subsequent systems and information about the exploit information about the exploit information about the exploit maturity. Do these scores look maturity. Do these scores look maturity. Do these scores look reasonable to you? I'm interested in reasonable to you? I'm interested in reasonable to you? I'm interested in adding CBSS 4.0 out to the advisory and adding CBSS 4.0 out to the advisory and adding CBSS 4.0 out to the advisory and the CVE record. The maintainer came the CVE record. The maintainer came the CVE record. The maintainer came back. back. back. Shelby much more reasonable now. And we all lived happily ever after now. And we all lived happily ever after now. And we all lived happily ever after because I did in fact update the because I did in fact update the because I did in fact update the advisory and update the CVE record. And advisory and update the CVE record. And advisory and update the CVE record. And nowadays people can see that CVE 2023 nowadays people can see that CVE 2023 nowadays people can see that CVE 2023 39363 was exploited in the wild. They 39363 was exploited in the wild. They 39363 was exploited in the wild. They can see it on cve.org. It's right there can see it on cve.org. It's right there can see it on cve.org. It's right there in the CVE record. It's tiny text on a in the CVE record. It's tiny text on a in the CVE record. It's tiny text on a tiny image, but trust me, it's there. tiny image, but trust me, it's there. tiny image, but trust me, it's there. You can go there and check. You can see You can go there and check. You can see You can go there and check. You can see it on NVD if you go to the NVD record it on NVD if you go to the NVD record it on NVD if you go to the NVD record for CVE 2023 for CVE 2023 for CVE 2023 39363 EA. It's right there. All they 39363 EA. It's right there. All they 39363 EA. It's right there. All they need is a CVSS to see that it was need is a CVSS to see that it was need is a CVSS to see that it was exploited. And the global GHSA, you can exploited. And the global GHSA, you can exploited. And the global GHSA, you can go to the GitHub advisory database. See go to the GitHub advisory database. See go to the GitHub advisory database. See the CVSS? It is right the CVSS? It is right the CVSS? It is right there. And it was beautiful. Now that we're coming up on beautiful. Now that we're coming up on beautiful. Now that we're coming up on the top of the hour, it's it's time the top of the hour, it's it's time the top of the hour, it's it's time where I should let you all know what you where I should let you all know what you where I should let you all know what you want to do if you want to learn more want to do if you want to learn more want to do if you want to learn more about this. Um, sadly, this is the last about this. Um, sadly, this is the last about this. Um, sadly, this is the last CVSs talk at BonCon CVSs talk at BonCon CVSs talk at BonCon 2025 and um, and there are no more 2025 and um, and there are no more 2025 and um, and there are no more anticipated for the next couple of days. anticipated for the next couple of days. anticipated for the next couple of days. Um, only some of the talks have been Um, only some of the talks have been Um, only some of the talks have been recorded and once they go live, you can recorded and once they go live, you can recorded and once they go live, you can uh, you can see them. But I attended the uh, you can see them. But I attended the uh, you can see them. But I attended the talks by Mr. Arnold and Mr. Leali and talks by Mr. Arnold and Mr. Leali and talks by Mr. Arnold and Mr. Leali and Mr. show and Dr. Jien and Ms. Jenang Mr. show and Dr. Jien and Ms. Jenang Mr. show and Dr. Jien and Ms. Jenang earlier today and I can reassure you earlier today and I can reassure you earlier today and I can reassure you that they were all fantastic and there that they were all fantastic and there that they were all fantastic and there are a lot of great talks happening at are a lot of great talks happening at are a lot of great talks happening at Vulmcon this year. Um, I also consulted Vulmcon this year. Um, I also consulted Vulmcon this year. Um, I also consulted first documentation on CVSS 4.0 when first documentation on CVSS 4.0 when first documentation on CVSS 4.0 when writing this talk to make sure I wasn't writing this talk to make sure I wasn't writing this talk to make sure I wasn't misunderstanding anything about any of misunderstanding anything about any of misunderstanding anything about any of the metrics and it is a fantastic the metrics and it is a fantastic the metrics and it is a fantastic resource and um and the Aurora Sterita resource and um and the Aurora Sterita resource and um and the Aurora Sterita blog post has some interesting data and blog post has some interesting data and blog post has some interesting data and I've seen some similar data and similar I've seen some similar data and similar I've seen some similar data and similar conclusions uh by the folks who gave conclusions uh by the folks who gave conclusions uh by the folks who gave talks here and um and that post helped talks here and um and that post helped talks here and um and that post helped me with this talk as well and now that me with this talk as well and now that me with this talk as well and now that we've reached the end those folks who uh we've reached the end those folks who uh we've reached the end those folks who uh who need to get going you all are who need to get going you all are who need to get going you all are welcome to get going But I'm going to be welcome to get going But I'm going to be welcome to get going But I'm going to be around for a while. I'm happy to answer around for a while. I'm happy to answer around for a while. I'm happy to answer questions. So if anyone in the audience questions. So if anyone in the audience questions. So if anyone in the audience has questions or if anyone on Discord has questions or if anyone on Discord has questions or if anyone on Discord has questions, I I'll be around for a has questions, I I'll be around for a has questions, I I'll be around for a while. We can chat a little longer. while. We can chat a little longer. while. We can chat a little longer. Thanks everyone. Hi. So I was curious is the expectation Hi. So I was curious is the expectation Hi. So I was curious is the expectation now that CBSS scores for version 4 will now that CBSS scores for version 4 will now that CBSS scores for version 4 will be updated when there's an exploit that be updated when there's an exploit that be updated when there's an exploit that occurs later. occurs later. occurs later. It depend I would say you know I would I It depend I would say you know I would I It depend I would say you know I would I would say it depends on the CNA and in would say it depends on the CNA and in would say it depends on the CNA and in um in the case of GitHub as a CNA it's um in the case of GitHub as a CNA it's um in the case of GitHub as a CNA it's important for us important for us important for us to I hesitate to say be the maintainer's to I hesitate to say be the maintainer's to I hesitate to say be the maintainer's voice but we do want to make sure we are voice but we do want to make sure we are voice but we do want to make sure we are accurately representing um the accurately representing um the accurately representing um the maintainer's perspective on the maintainer's perspective on the maintainer's perspective on the vulnerability and in the case of this vulnerability and in the case of this vulnerability and in the case of this particular maintainer it was very particular maintainer it was very particular maintainer it was very important for people to know that this important for people to know that this important for people to know that this issue had been exploited and that they issue had been exploited and that they issue had been exploited and that they had gone to certain lengths to fix it. had gone to certain lengths to fix it. had gone to certain lengths to fix it. So, they were very interested in getting So, they were very interested in getting So, they were very interested in getting the word out there. It's not a necessity the word out there. It's not a necessity the word out there. It's not a necessity if um if someone doesn't want that if um if someone doesn't want that if um if someone doesn't want that information out there, but in this case, information out there, but in this case, information out there, but in this case, it was, you know, it was um it was it was, you know, it was um it was it was, you know, it was um it was important and um and that was nice to important and um and that was nice to important and um and that was nice to have to have that tool available to help have to have that tool available to help have to have that tool available to help them with their message. them with their message. them with their message. So, so now that there's a field that So, so now that there's a field that So, so now that there's a field that indicates the level of um you know indicates the level of um you know indicates the level of um you know exploit attacks in the wild attacks exploit attacks in the wild attacks exploit attacks in the wild attacks happening, what implications does that happening, what implications does that happening, what implications does that have for like the duplicity with like have for like the duplicity with like have for like the duplicity with like SISA keb? I think that um I think that kev still I think that um I think that kev still I think that um I think that kev still has its place because and sometimes you has its place because and sometimes you has its place because and sometimes you do want to start with finding something do want to start with finding something do want to start with finding something that has been exploited in the wild that has been exploited in the wild that has been exploited in the wild rather than starting with learning about rather than starting with learning about rather than starting with learning about a product and then going on to see if a product and then going on to see if a product and then going on to see if it's exploited in the wild. Um, I still it's exploited in the wild. Um, I still it's exploited in the wild. Um, I still think that it's very valuable to have think that it's very valuable to have think that it's very valuable to have those specific scores, but uh, those specific scores, but uh, those specific scores, but uh, especially because exploit maturity especially because exploit maturity especially because exploit maturity isn't part of the CBSS base metrics, and isn't part of the CBSS base metrics, and isn't part of the CBSS base metrics, and there are those organizations that use there are those organizations that use there are those organizations that use tools that don't recognize anything tools that don't recognize anything tools that don't recognize anything after the base metrics. So, you still after the base metrics. So, you still after the base metrics. So, you still have space for those tools that um, that have space for those tools that um, that have space for those tools that um, that it's either a binary, yes, no, it's been it's either a binary, yes, no, it's been it's either a binary, yes, no, it's been exploited, or it's something like EPSS exploited, or it's something like EPSS exploited, or it's something like EPSS where it's more of a probability score. where it's more of a probability score. where it's more of a probability score. So, this talk is wonderful. I love to So, this talk is wonderful. I love to So, this talk is wonderful. I love to see EPSS4 kind of used dynamically and see EPSS4 kind of used dynamically and see EPSS4 kind of used dynamically and and not just taken as canonical. So, and not just taken as canonical. So, and not just taken as canonical. So, it's really great that GitHub's doing it's really great that GitHub's doing it's really great that GitHub's doing this. Um, I may be fishing for an answer this. Um, I may be fishing for an answer this. Um, I may be fishing for an answer here. Uh, do you think the EPSS SIG here. Uh, do you think the EPSS SIG here. Uh, do you think the EPSS SIG aired in making the default for exploit aired in making the default for exploit aired in making the default for exploit attacked? You can also be have a diplomatic answer You can also be have a diplomatic answer You can also be have a diplomatic answer and that's okay. and that's okay. and that's okay. I wouldn't say it's an error because um I wouldn't say it's an error because um I wouldn't say it's an error because um it depends on the perspective you're it depends on the perspective you're it depends on the perspective you're coming from. Um and traditionally CVSS coming from. Um and traditionally CVSS coming from. Um and traditionally CVSS has come from a perspect like in has come from a perspect like in has come from a perspect like in particular when you're you when you're particular when you're you when you're particular when you're you when you're talking about um something I I know NVD talking about um something I I know NVD talking about um something I I know NVD is not the same thing but when you're is not the same thing but when you're is not the same thing but when you're talking about um NVD or other more talking about um NVD or other more talking about um NVD or other more general data providers having a policy general data providers having a policy general data providers having a policy of assuming a worst case scenario then of assuming a worst case scenario then of assuming a worst case scenario then assuming a worst case scenario is a assuming a worst case scenario is a assuming a worst case scenario is a reasonable decision. reasonable decision. reasonable decision. Um, and quite frankly, as vulnerability Um, and quite frankly, as vulnerability Um, and quite frankly, as vulnerability data gets older and time goes on, um, it data gets older and time goes on, um, it data gets older and time goes on, um, it can be more difficult to sus out whether can be more difficult to sus out whether can be more difficult to sus out whether something has been exploited in the wild something has been exploited in the wild something has been exploited in the wild or not, so it may so it may be more or not, so it may so it may be more or not, so it may so it may be more appropriate to assume the worst case appropriate to assume the worst case appropriate to assume the worst case scenario and bring it down rather than scenario and bring it down rather than scenario and bring it down rather than less serious and bring it up. But it it less serious and bring it up. But it it less serious and bring it up. But it it depends on your philosophy toward these depends on your philosophy toward these depends on your philosophy toward these things. Um I I think that in general things. Um I I think that in general things. Um I I think that in general it's better on the enrichment side to it's better on the enrichment side to it's better on the enrichment side to air toward you know including that air toward you know including that air toward you know including that information rather than not including it information rather than not including it information rather than not including it but yeah okay uh so one question from my yeah okay uh so one question from my yeah okay uh so one question from my side would be um you mentioned that uh side would be um you mentioned that uh side would be um you mentioned that uh okay um in response to even the first okay um in response to even the first okay um in response to even the first question who is supposed to uh fill this question who is supposed to uh fill this question who is supposed to uh fill this uh exploit code maturity field in the uh exploit code maturity field in the uh exploit code maturity field in the CVSs in your opinion CVSs in your opinion CVSs in your opinion Um so this would largely be the CNA. I Um so this would largely be the CNA. I Um so this would largely be the CNA. I think that think that think that um I you know granted the CNA although um I you know granted the CNA although um I you know granted the CNA although um you know if a main in my case in my um you know if a main in my case in my um you know if a main in my case in my job if a maintainer came and said you job if a maintainer came and said you job if a maintainer came and said you know we know there's been an exploit in know we know there's been an exploit in know we know there's been an exploit in the wild and we want to include this I the wild and we want to include this I the wild and we want to include this I would be fine. Or if they said you would be fine. Or if they said you would be fine. Or if they said you there's a proof of concept but no proof there's a proof of concept but no proof there's a proof of concept but no proof of exploitation in the wild I would be of exploitation in the wild I would be of exploitation in the wild I would be fine with including that. Uh, but if fine with including that. Uh, but if fine with including that. Uh, but if your CNA is an org, you know, where they your CNA is an org, you know, where they your CNA is an org, you know, where they handle their own products and they're handle their own products and they're handle their own products and they're not dealing with things on the open- not dealing with things on the open- not dealing with things on the open- source side, then that would be source side, then that would be source side, then that would be something that the org would have to something that the org would have to something that the org would have to decide. Yeah, actually this is where my decide. Yeah, actually this is where my decide. Yeah, actually this is where my confusion stems from because first of confusion stems from because first of confusion stems from because first of all, the CVSS 4.0 zero documentation all, the CVSS 4.0 zero documentation all, the CVSS 4.0 zero documentation clearly says this field has to be filled clearly says this field has to be filled clearly says this field has to be filled by the consumer of the CVSS which I also by the consumer of the CVSS which I also by the consumer of the CVSS which I also agree to uh because this is like yeah agree to uh because this is like yeah agree to uh because this is like yeah it's uh threat intell information or it's uh threat intell information or it's uh threat intell information or something which you at a consumer end something which you at a consumer end something which you at a consumer end can actually enrich the CVSS with can actually enrich the CVSS with can actually enrich the CVSS with because if you say now the CNA has to because if you say now the CNA has to because if you say now the CNA has to fill this information then they need to fill this information then they need to fill this information then they need to know okay every vulnerability where it know okay every vulnerability where it know okay every vulnerability where it is exploited in the wild or something or is exploited in the wild or something or is exploited in the wild or something or if there is a proof of concept available if there is a proof of concept available if there is a proof of concept available or not so that confused me a bit or not so that confused me a bit or not so that confused me a bit Is CNA now supposed to know all this and Is CNA now supposed to know all this and Is CNA now supposed to know all this and then fill this field? Now, that's a then fill this field? Now, that's a then fill this field? Now, that's a little bit rough because GitHub exists little bit rough because GitHub exists little bit rough because GitHub exists in an interesting place in CNA land in an interesting place in CNA land in an interesting place in CNA land because we are both a producer of CVE because we are both a producer of CVE because we are both a producer of CVE information and a downstream consumer of information and a downstream consumer of information and a downstream consumer of CVE information. So, we operate with a CVE information. So, we operate with a CVE information. So, we operate with a foot in both worlds. Um, it's probably foot in both worlds. Um, it's probably foot in both worlds. Um, it's probably more of a clear answer when uh when your more of a clear answer when uh when your more of a clear answer when uh when your org is one or the other. org is one or the other. org is one or the other. Um, so for those of you who are watching Um, so for those of you who are watching Um, so for those of you who are watching online, um, there were two questions online, um, there were two questions online, um, there were two questions that, uh, that I could hear, but the that, uh, that I could hear, but the that, uh, that I could hear, but the microphone sounds like it didn't pick microphone sounds like it didn't pick microphone sounds like it didn't pick up. And the first one was, yeah, and the up. And the first one was, yeah, and the up. And the first one was, yeah, and the first one was, is there a hard deadline first one was, is there a hard deadline first one was, is there a hard deadline for stopping use of CVSS3? And I saw two for stopping use of CVSS3? And I saw two for stopping use of CVSS3? And I saw two heads very vigorously shaking. No, we heads very vigorously shaking. No, we heads very vigorously shaking. No, we will come for you if you don't move to will come for you if you don't move to will come for you if you don't move to version version version 4. I will in the dead of night. I will 4. I will in the dead of night. I will 4. I will in the dead of night. I will change all your scores to version 4. No. change all your scores to version 4. No. change all your scores to version 4. No. No. The the second question was um was No. The the second question was um was No. The the second question was um was is there anyone using exploit maturity is there anyone using exploit maturity is there anyone using exploit maturity in CVSS3? And the answer is no because in CVSS3? And the answer is no because in CVSS3? And the answer is no because exploit maturity was introduced in 4.0. exploit maturity was introduced in 4.0. exploit maturity was introduced in 4.0. There is a similar concept called There is a similar concept called There is a similar concept called exploit code maturity in 3.1 but it exploit code maturity in 3.1 but it exploit code maturity in 3.1 but it works differently than 4.0 and I works differently than 4.0 and I works differently than 4.0 and I deliberately didn't include it in the deliberately didn't include it in the deliberately didn't include it in the talk. Oh. talk. Oh. talk. Oh. Um that is a good question. Um for some Um that is a good question. Um for some Um that is a good question. Um for some GitHub security advisories, I know that GitHub security advisories, I know that GitHub security advisories, I know that there are some where we use 3.1 and 4.0 there are some where we use 3.1 and 4.0 there are some where we use 3.1 and 4.0 alongside um exploit maturity. Uh a lot alongside um exploit maturity. Uh a lot alongside um exploit maturity. Uh a lot of times this is done in order to of times this is done in order to of times this is done in order to provide more concordance between the provide more concordance between the provide more concordance between the CVSS3.1 and CVSS4.0 scores. pretty CVSS3.1 and CVSS4.0 scores. pretty CVSS3.1 and CVSS4.0 scores. pretty common example is u is the example that common example is u is the example that common example is u is the example that I showed earlier of the authenticated I showed earlier of the authenticated I showed earlier of the authenticated denial of service vulnerability where denial of service vulnerability where denial of service vulnerability where um where let's see where is it um the um where let's see where is it um the um where let's see where is it um the authenticated denial of service authenticated denial of service authenticated denial of service vulnerability where folks would be vulnerability where folks would be vulnerability where folks would be expecting to see something that's expecting to see something that's expecting to see something that's moderate but um if we have a proof of moderate but um if we have a proof of moderate but um if we have a proof of concept but no proof of exploitation in concept but no proof of exploitation in concept but no proof of exploitation in the wild um assessing it as high the wild um assessing it as high the wild um assessing it as high severity to a lot of people would be an severity to a lot of people would be an severity to a lot of people would be an overcore because they're they're overcore because they're they're overcore because they're they're expecting to see medium based on their expecting to see medium based on their expecting to see medium based on their experience with experience with experience with CVSS3. Um, so this is a this is a CVSS3. Um, so this is a this is a CVSS3. Um, so this is a this is a situation and and I would say a not situation and and I would say a not situation and and I would say a not uncommon situation to use something like uncommon situation to use something like uncommon situation to use something like E proof of concept or E unreported to um E proof of concept or E unreported to um E proof of concept or E unreported to um to make a CVSS you don't want and a CVSS to make a CVSS you don't want and a CVSS to make a CVSS you don't want and a CVSS 4.0 score uh in better 4.0 score uh in better 4.0 score uh in better alignment. Thanks. Are there any uh any alignment. Thanks. Are there any uh any alignment. Thanks. Are there any uh any questions from the Discord? Oh, sorry. questions from the Discord? Oh, sorry. questions from the Discord? Oh, sorry. We have an in-person question. We have an in-person question. We have an in-person question. Like the idea of the exploit maturity Like the idea of the exploit maturity Like the idea of the exploit maturity component. The thing that actually component. The thing that actually component. The thing that actually worries me is it's not being applied worries me is it's not being applied worries me is it's not being applied consistently. Like if it's an optional consistently. Like if it's an optional consistently. Like if it's an optional metric, if you're evaluating all your metric, if you're evaluating all your metric, if you're evaluating all your risk, it should be on everything. And risk, it should be on everything. And risk, it should be on everything. And otherwise you're you're you're basically otherwise you're you're you're basically otherwise you're you're you're basically having you're cherrypicking as like like having you're cherrypicking as like like having you're cherrypicking as like like you said you think it should be critical you said you think it should be critical you said you think it should be critical and you finding a way to justify it and you finding a way to justify it and you finding a way to justify it which again I'm not saying it's not but which again I'm not saying it's not but which again I'm not saying it's not but if you're not applying the same standard if you're not applying the same standard if you're not applying the same standard to everything and and considering the to everything and and considering the to everything and and considering the the exploit maturity as a standard the exploit maturity as a standard the exploit maturity as a standard component it might skew your overall component it might skew your overall component it might skew your overall evaluation of of the vulnerabilities in evaluation of of the vulnerabilities in evaluation of of the vulnerabilities in your environment and said if it's going your environment and said if it's going your environment and said if it's going to be included great the CNAs are going to be included great the CNAs are going to be included great the CNAs are going to included great. But if it's only to included great. But if it's only to included great. But if it's only applied sometimes when certain things applied sometimes when certain things applied sometimes when certain things are needed, it it kind of skews a lot of are needed, it it kind of skews a lot of are needed, it it kind of skews a lot of stuff, sometimes good, sometimes not. So stuff, sometimes good, sometimes not. So stuff, sometimes good, sometimes not. So just a a comment on the examples. I just a a comment on the examples. I just a a comment on the examples. I think that's a fair perspective to have. think that's a fair perspective to have. think that's a fair perspective to have. And one of the things that's um that's a And one of the things that's um that's a And one of the things that's um that's a little bit difficult for me in terms of little bit difficult for me in terms of little bit difficult for me in terms of consistency is that in my work we have consistency is that in my work we have consistency is that in my work we have to deal with such a broad variety of to deal with such a broad variety of to deal with such a broad variety of software. And it turns out finding like software. And it turns out finding like software. And it turns out finding like one scoring system for assessing one scoring system for assessing one scoring system for assessing vulnerabilities in all software is vulnerabilities in all software is vulnerabilities in all software is pretty hard. So some squishiness and pretty hard. So some squishiness and pretty hard. So some squishiness and some level of inconsistency is somewhat some level of inconsistency is somewhat some level of inconsistency is somewhat inevitable. But um but that's a fair inevitable. But um but that's a fair inevitable. But um but that's a fair comment to say that uh to say that it comment to say that uh to say that it comment to say that uh to say that it would be nice to have um to have more consistency. So um I have another consistency. So um I have another consistency. So um I have another question about the intended usage of question about the intended usage of question about the intended usage of that uh metrics in your uh domain. So that uh metrics in your uh domain. So that uh metrics in your uh domain. So coming from a uh cyber resilience act coming from a uh cyber resilience act coming from a uh cyber resilience act perspective where they specifically say perspective where they specifically say perspective where they specifically say like there's a vulnerability that is like there's a vulnerability that is like there's a vulnerability that is exploited with malicious intent and then exploited with malicious intent and then exploited with malicious intent and then you have reporting reporting you have reporting reporting you have reporting reporting applications. Did you or do you consider applications. Did you or do you consider applications. Did you or do you consider to encounter something like that as kind to encounter something like that as kind to encounter something like that as kind of a mislicious intent? Because kind of of a mislicious intent? Because kind of of a mislicious intent? Because kind of as a CNA when we find code on GitHub as a CNA when we find code on GitHub as a CNA when we find code on GitHub that kind of you download it, you run that kind of you download it, you run that kind of you download it, you run it, that's still kind of a proof of it, that's still kind of a proof of it, that's still kind of a proof of concept type of thing versus the uh we concept type of thing versus the uh we concept type of thing versus the uh we did not see it as malicious intent. Is did not see it as malicious intent. Is did not see it as malicious intent. Is there anything that your statement is there anything that your statement is there anything that your statement is when this is set by GitHub uh our when this is set by GitHub uh our when this is set by GitHub uh our reporting obligations should trigger? reporting obligations should trigger? reporting obligations should trigger? Maybe also asking a nation state Yeah, that's that's difficult to say Yeah, that's that's difficult to say Yeah, that's that's difficult to say because um because I've never been in a because um because I've never been in a because um because I've never been in a situation where someone disagrees about situation where someone disagrees about situation where someone disagrees about whether or not something has been whether or not something has been whether or not something has been exploited in the wild and I came from exploited in the wild and I came from exploited in the wild and I came from the perspective of a maintainer says the perspective of a maintainer says the perspective of a maintainer says this has been exploited in the wild and this has been exploited in the wild and this has been exploited in the wild and they believe this is serious. they believe this is serious. they believe this is serious. Um you know that's interesting on the Um you know that's interesting on the Um you know that's interesting on the security researcher side. I don't have security researcher side. I don't have security researcher side. I don't have as much experience with the security as much experience with the security as much experience with the security researcher side and what if the security researcher side and what if the security researcher side and what if the security researcher says this this has been out researcher says this this has been out researcher says this this has been out there? That's a really good question. there? That's a really good question. there? That's a really good question. But I think the question also arises But I think the question also arises But I think the question also arises when you're talking about things like when you're talking about things like when you're talking about things like kev at what point is it considered a kev at what point is it considered a kev at what point is it considered a known exploited known exploited known exploited vulnerability? Okay, it's a little bit vulnerability? Okay, it's a little bit vulnerability? Okay, it's a little bit after I'm I'm happy to continue the after I'm I'm happy to continue the after I'm I'm happy to continue the conversation, but it is now a little bit conversation, but it is now a little bit conversation, but it is now a little bit after the hour. So I think um I think we after the hour. So I think um I think we after the hour. So I think um I think we have to have to wrap up.
