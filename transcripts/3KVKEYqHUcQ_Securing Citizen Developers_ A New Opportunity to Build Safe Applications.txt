Kind: captions Language: en All right. So, yes, I am Kayla All right. So, yes, I am Kayla All right. So, yes, I am Kayla Underoffer, lead security engineer in Underoffer, lead security engineer in Underoffer, lead security engineer in the CTO office with Zenity. And um I'm the CTO office with Zenity. And um I'm the CTO office with Zenity. And um I'm super excited to be here today. If uh super excited to be here today. If uh super excited to be here today. If uh those of you who who've uh chatted with those of you who who've uh chatted with those of you who who've uh chatted with me for maybe more than 30 minutes know me for maybe more than 30 minutes know me for maybe more than 30 minutes know how much I love this conference and I'm how much I love this conference and I'm how much I love this conference and I'm super excited to be on stage here super excited to be on stage here super excited to be on stage here presenting today. So, um these are all presenting today. So, um these are all presenting today. So, um these are all other things about me. um and I'm not other things about me. um and I'm not other things about me. um and I'm not going to talk about them because we have going to talk about them because we have going to talk about them because we have an agenda to get to an agenda to get to an agenda to get to today. today. today. So today we're going to cover our new So today we're going to cover our new So today we're going to cover our new hope of citizen development and how we hope of citizen development and how we hope of citizen development and how we can build secure applications through can build secure applications through can build secure applications through citizen development. But I would be citizen development. But I would be citizen development. But I would be remiss if I didn't start that journey remiss if I didn't start that journey remiss if I didn't start that journey off by talking a little bit about shift off by talking a little bit about shift off by talking a little bit about shift left and uh some of the challenges we've left and uh some of the challenges we've left and uh some of the challenges we've experienced with shift left and then how experienced with shift left and then how experienced with shift left and then how we can apply those to our new hope of we can apply those to our new hope of we can apply those to our new hope of citizen development. We got to talk citizen development. We got to talk citizen development. We got to talk about what security risks are introduced about what security risks are introduced about what security risks are introduced through citizen development and then how through citizen development and then how through citizen development and then how we're actually going to reduce risk in we're actually going to reduce risk in we're actually going to reduce risk in these environments. So that's the these environments. So that's the these environments. So that's the journey we're going to go on today. journey we're going to go on today. journey we're going to go on today. Um, so I think that shift left is one of Um, so I think that shift left is one of Um, so I think that shift left is one of those love to hate, hate to love topics those love to hate, hate to love topics those love to hate, hate to love topics that I still see uh, you know, comments that I still see uh, you know, comments that I still see uh, you know, comments and opinions floating around all the and opinions floating around all the and opinions floating around all the time. Um, for the purposes of this time. Um, for the purposes of this time. Um, for the purposes of this presentation, my definition here of presentation, my definition here of presentation, my definition here of shift left is identifying shift left is identifying shift left is identifying vulnerabilities as early as possible or vulnerabilities as early as possible or vulnerabilities as early as possible or earlier at least in the software earlier at least in the software earlier at least in the software development life cycle to reduce the development life cycle to reduce the development life cycle to reduce the amount of vulnerabilities that we have amount of vulnerabilities that we have amount of vulnerabilities that we have in production. That's the goal. That's in production. That's the goal. That's in production. That's the goal. That's what we want to see with shift left. what we want to see with shift left. what we want to see with shift left. There's been two main kind of strategies There's been two main kind of strategies There's been two main kind of strategies for how we've tried to accomplish this. for how we've tried to accomplish this. for how we've tried to accomplish this. One has been taking security and picking One has been taking security and picking One has been taking security and picking them up and plopping them in the them up and plopping them in the them up and plopping them in the software development life cycle. Uh the software development life cycle. Uh the software development life cycle. Uh the other has been taking security other has been taking security other has been taking security responsibilities, taking those and responsibilities, taking those and responsibilities, taking those and assigning them to engineers and software assigning them to engineers and software assigning them to engineers and software developers. Neither of these have developers. Neither of these have developers. Neither of these have necessarily turned out uh as we would necessarily turned out uh as we would necessarily turned out uh as we would like them to, as we know, because we're like them to, as we know, because we're like them to, as we know, because we're all here at Voncon. Um so, two main all here at Voncon. Um so, two main all here at Voncon. Um so, two main themes why there's a million reasons themes why there's a million reasons themes why there's a million reasons why, but I just want to touch on two of why, but I just want to touch on two of why, but I just want to touch on two of them. Um there's a mismatch of them. Um there's a mismatch of them. Um there's a mismatch of expectations uh throughout this whole expectations uh throughout this whole expectations uh throughout this whole journey. We've not been able to bring journey. We've not been able to bring journey. We've not been able to bring together uh the engineers, the software together uh the engineers, the software together uh the engineers, the software developers, the application owners and developers, the application owners and developers, the application owners and security and really tied that security and really tied that security and really tied that expectation setting to say we're going expectation setting to say we're going expectation setting to say we're going to tie some security results like secure to tie some security results like secure to tie some security results like secure code at the end of this as a part of how code at the end of this as a part of how code at the end of this as a part of how you're measured when you build software you're measured when you build software you're measured when you build software in the first place. We've not really in the first place. We've not really in the first place. We've not really been able to achieve that goal. Um, been able to achieve that goal. Um, been able to achieve that goal. Um, additionally, uh, we are our own worst additionally, uh, we are our own worst additionally, uh, we are our own worst enemies very often in security. We have enemies very often in security. We have enemies very often in security. We have a 100 million vulnerabilities out there. a 100 million vulnerabilities out there. a 100 million vulnerabilities out there. Like maybe we didn't introduce them, but Like maybe we didn't introduce them, but Like maybe we didn't introduce them, but you know, they end up on our plate. We you know, they end up on our plate. We you know, they end up on our plate. We are overwhelmed by them. The software are overwhelmed by them. The software are overwhelmed by them. The software engineers and developers are also engineers and developers are also engineers and developers are also overwhelmed by them. And then you take overwhelmed by them. And then you take overwhelmed by them. And then you take into account that from their into account that from their into account that from their perspective, there's 99 million false perspective, there's 99 million false perspective, there's 99 million false positives. So 100 million positives. So 100 million positives. So 100 million vulnerabilities. and they certainly hope vulnerabilities. and they certainly hope vulnerabilities. and they certainly hope that 99 million of them are false that 99 million of them are false that 99 million of them are false positives because it's a little easier positives because it's a little easier positives because it's a little easier to chuck that over the fence back to to chuck that over the fence back to to chuck that over the fence back to security and say you deal with it. Um security and say you deal with it. Um security and say you deal with it. Um and then we make it worse because and then we make it worse because and then we make it worse because there's you know 100 million there's you know 100 million there's you know 100 million vulnerabilities, 99 million false vulnerabilities, 99 million false vulnerabilities, 99 million false positives and five security team members positives and five security team members positives and five security team members and we have inserted ourselves as a and we have inserted ourselves as a and we have inserted ourselves as a blocker to shipping code into production blocker to shipping code into production blocker to shipping code into production and uh that is what those teams are and uh that is what those teams are and uh that is what those teams are measured on better code faster and um we measured on better code faster and um we measured on better code faster and um we have inserted ourselves as blocker and have inserted ourselves as blocker and have inserted ourselves as blocker and there's only five of us. So uh there's a there's only five of us. So uh there's a there's only five of us. So uh there's a lot of other reasons like I said as to lot of other reasons like I said as to lot of other reasons like I said as to why this hasn't panned out exactly as we why this hasn't panned out exactly as we why this hasn't panned out exactly as we would have hoped but I am not here to to would have hoped but I am not here to to would have hoped but I am not here to to fix shift left today from the uh fix shift left today from the uh fix shift left today from the uh professional developers perspective professional developers perspective professional developers perspective instead I want to talk about our new instead I want to talk about our new instead I want to talk about our new hope our new hope um with a new audience hope our new hope um with a new audience hope our new hope um with a new audience a new technology a new technology a new technology um but the same goals we have the same um but the same goals we have the same um but the same goals we have the same goals of creating more secure goals of creating more secure goals of creating more secure applications in the production applications in the production applications in the production life cycle. So that new hope is citizen life cycle. So that new hope is citizen life cycle. So that new hope is citizen development. Um it's a Microsoft coined development. Um it's a Microsoft coined development. Um it's a Microsoft coined term. Uh this is the tech target term. Uh this is the tech target term. Uh this is the tech target definition. The key things to bring out definition. The key things to bring out definition. The key things to bring out here are these it's a business process here are these it's a business process here are these it's a business process and we're encouraging nonIT trained and we're encouraging nonIT trained and we're encouraging nonIT trained employees to become software developers. employees to become software developers. employees to become software developers. And we're doing this through low code, And we're doing this through low code, And we're doing this through low code, no code technology, building blocks, no code technology, building blocks, no code technology, building blocks, Legos if you will, right? That allow us Legos if you will, right? That allow us Legos if you will, right? That allow us to build production level to build production level to build production level applications. Um, you can see maybe a applications. Um, you can see maybe a applications. Um, you can see maybe a couple logos that you might be familiar couple logos that you might be familiar couple logos that you might be familiar with, maybe might be in your with, maybe might be in your with, maybe might be in your organization, maybe not. These are organization, maybe not. These are organization, maybe not. These are enterprise level platforms, right? That enterprise level platforms, right? That enterprise level platforms, right? That are embedded within every organization are embedded within every organization are embedded within every organization in one way, shape or form. and and it's in one way, shape or form. and and it's in one way, shape or form. and and it's these platforms that are enabling these platforms that are enabling these platforms that are enabling citizen development to take place. So citizen development to take place. So citizen development to take place. So who are these builders? Well, citizen who are these builders? Well, citizen who are these builders? Well, citizen developers are business users. And while developers are business users. And while developers are business users. And while you know there's the joke about this you know there's the joke about this you know there's the joke about this part, these people are absolutely part, these people are absolutely part, these people are absolutely professionals in what they do. They are professionals in what they do. They are professionals in what they do. They are professionals in finance and experts in professionals in finance and experts in professionals in finance and experts in finance, experts in human resources, finance, experts in human resources, finance, experts in human resources, experts in marketing. They are not IT. experts in marketing. They are not IT. experts in marketing. They are not IT. They are not professional software They are not professional software They are not professional software developers. They are most certainly not developers. They are most certainly not developers. They are most certainly not security. So what are these citizen security. So what are these citizen security. So what are these citizen developers building? Well, first off, developers building? Well, first off, developers building? Well, first off, they're building a lot. So we have a they're building a lot. So we have a they're building a lot. So we have a Zenit has a 2024 uh enterprise state of Zenit has a 2024 uh enterprise state of Zenit has a 2024 uh enterprise state of low code no code report that we low code no code report that we low code no code report that we published and on average with the published and on average with the published and on average with the environments that we were working with, environments that we were working with, environments that we were working with, there was over 79,000 applications being there was over 79,000 applications being there was over 79,000 applications being built by business users in these built by business users in these built by business users in these environments. environments. environments. So what do we mean by an an application So what do we mean by an an application So what do we mean by an an application in this case? Um they can be complex in this case? Um they can be complex in this case? Um they can be complex automations and workflows. They can be automations and workflows. They can be automations and workflows. They can be simple ones. They can be fully simple ones. They can be fully simple ones. They can be fully functioning customerf facing functioning customerf facing functioning customerf facing applications, external facing applications, external facing applications, external facing applications. Um now today they can be applications. Um now today they can be applications. Um now today they can be AI agents, right? The bleeding edge of AI agents, right? The bleeding edge of AI agents, right? The bleeding edge of technology that we're all still trying technology that we're all still trying technology that we're all still trying to figure out from a security to figure out from a security to figure out from a security perspective and a use case perspective. perspective and a use case perspective. perspective and a use case perspective. super easy to build AI agents in these super easy to build AI agents in these super easy to build AI agents in these platforms and we have citizen developers platforms and we have citizen developers platforms and we have citizen developers who are able to unleash this technology who are able to unleash this technology who are able to unleash this technology with very little guardrails. Um, so what with very little guardrails. Um, so what with very little guardrails. Um, so what do all these things have in common? do all these things have in common? do all these things have in common? Critical data. We're talking about Critical data. We're talking about Critical data. We're talking about business innovation platforms. Business business innovation platforms. Business business innovation platforms. Business data is inherent to what they do. It's data is inherent to what they do. It's data is inherent to what they do. It's native. And so now we have these native. And so now we have these native. And so now we have these applications being built in platforms applications being built in platforms applications being built in platforms that inherently interact with critical that inherently interact with critical that inherently interact with critical data and and and we um have the attack data and and and we um have the attack data and and and we um have the attack surface of 79,000 applications roaming surface of 79,000 applications roaming surface of 79,000 applications roaming around there. When you take all of that around there. When you take all of that around there. When you take all of that into combination, the size of the into combination, the size of the into combination, the size of the environments, the builders, the environments, the builders, the environments, the builders, the criticality of the target, which is your criticality of the target, which is your criticality of the target, which is your critical business data, you know, we critical business data, you know, we critical business data, you know, we have to ask ourselves like what could have to ask ourselves like what could have to ask ourselves like what could possibly go possibly go possibly go wrong. And I think we all have some wrong. And I think we all have some wrong. And I think we all have some idea. Uh I want to start off first with idea. Uh I want to start off first with idea. Uh I want to start off first with acknowledging that this this flywheel acknowledging that this this flywheel acknowledging that this this flywheel might look kind of familiar uh software might look kind of familiar uh software might look kind of familiar uh software development life cycle. uh but it's development life cycle. uh but it's development life cycle. uh but it's different if you pay attention because different if you pay attention because different if you pay attention because it's the business that owns everything. it's the business that owns everything. it's the business that owns everything. This is the citizen development software This is the citizen development software This is the citizen development software development life cycle and I put that development life cycle and I put that development life cycle and I put that air quotes because uh first off the air quotes because uh first off the air quotes because uh first off the business owns every aspect of this and business owns every aspect of this and business owns every aspect of this and secondarily they basically envision and secondarily they basically envision and secondarily they basically envision and create. So they're like this is what I create. So they're like this is what I create. So they're like this is what I want to build and I'm going to build it want to build and I'm going to build it want to build and I'm going to build it and then I think I want to build this and then I think I want to build this and then I think I want to build this other thing and I'm going to build it other thing and I'm going to build it other thing and I'm going to build it and there's not even really much and there's not even really much and there's not even really much iteration right on the applications and iteration right on the applications and iteration right on the applications and the workflows just build another one. So the workflows just build another one. So the workflows just build another one. So there is no proper software development there is no proper software development there is no proper software development life cycle. Um and and especially it is life cycle. Um and and especially it is life cycle. Um and and especially it is not involved, security is not involved, not involved, security is not involved, not involved, security is not involved, all of those traditional all of those traditional all of those traditional stakeholders are not a part of this stakeholders are not a part of this stakeholders are not a part of this process. So what risks are introduced process. So what risks are introduced process. So what risks are introduced through that? So we typically split through that? So we typically split through that? So we typically split these risks up into two categories, these risks up into two categories, these risks up into two categories, especially because now we're talking especially because now we're talking especially because now we're talking about AI agents. So you'll see the about AI agents. So you'll see the about AI agents. So you'll see the runtime risk, there's a lot of agentic runtime risk, there's a lot of agentic runtime risk, there's a lot of agentic focus in there, AI focus in there. Um, focus in there, AI focus in there. Um, focus in there, AI focus in there. Um, but build time is really where the story but build time is really where the story but build time is really where the story starts. So these are the choices that starts. So these are the choices that starts. So these are the choices that are being made when you put together the are being made when you put together the are being made when you put together the Legos to make this application. Um, it's Legos to make this application. Um, it's Legos to make this application. Um, it's it's the the the actual like radio it's the the the actual like radio it's the the the actual like radio dials, you know, that's how we're dials, you know, that's how we're dials, you know, that's how we're building these applications. building these applications. building these applications. And um again from that 2024 report uh And um again from that 2024 report uh And um again from that 2024 report uh the top three risks identified in these the top three risks identified in these the top three risks identified in these environments um were authorization environments um were authorization environments um were authorization misuse, authentication failures, and misuse, authentication failures, and misuse, authentication failures, and data and secrets handling. So I think data and secrets handling. So I think data and secrets handling. So I think we're all probably pretty familiar with we're all probably pretty familiar with we're all probably pretty familiar with those as risks from the traditional those as risks from the traditional those as risks from the traditional application application security application application security application application security vulnerability management space. Looks a vulnerability management space. Looks a vulnerability management space. Looks a little bit different. We're going to little bit different. We're going to little bit different. We're going to talk about some examples. Um and then on talk about some examples. Um and then on talk about some examples. Um and then on the runtime side of course this is you the runtime side of course this is you the runtime side of course this is you know this is the the actual act of the know this is the the actual act of the know this is the the actual act of the agent doing what it does in these uh agent doing what it does in these uh agent doing what it does in these uh business innovation environments. So we business innovation environments. So we business innovation environments. So we see risks like prompt injection that can see risks like prompt injection that can see risks like prompt injection that can be both direct and indirect depending on be both direct and indirect depending on be both direct and indirect depending on on the attack. Um you have curious AI on the attack. Um you have curious AI on the attack. Um you have curious AI which is you know hallucinations or it which is you know hallucinations or it which is you know hallucinations or it lying to you really well. Um sensitive lying to you really well. Um sensitive lying to you really well. Um sensitive data exfiltration jailbreaking all these data exfiltration jailbreaking all these data exfiltration jailbreaking all these things happen in runtime. But what I things happen in runtime. But what I things happen in runtime. But what I love about runtime is that the choices love about runtime is that the choices love about runtime is that the choices that you make when you build the that you make when you build the that you make when you build the thing increase or decrease the attack thing increase or decrease the attack thing increase or decrease the attack surface of your risk, your runtime risk, surface of your risk, your runtime risk, surface of your risk, your runtime risk, because you can make choices that make because you can make choices that make because you can make choices that make this thing more secure or less. Um, and this thing more secure or less. Um, and this thing more secure or less. Um, and all of that goes into then when it all of that goes into then when it all of that goes into then when it actually takes place and it's starting actually takes place and it's starting actually takes place and it's starting to do its job. So, let's look at a to do its job. So, let's look at a to do its job. So, let's look at a couple of these real quick. We're not couple of these real quick. We're not couple of these real quick. We're not going to spend too much time on them. going to spend too much time on them. going to spend too much time on them. Um, first one, authorization misuse. So, Um, first one, authorization misuse. So, Um, first one, authorization misuse. So, this is just a little graph that like this is just a little graph that like this is just a little graph that like we're talking about this uh credit we're talking about this uh credit we're talking about this uh credit approval agent is our is our main approval agent is our is our main approval agent is our is our main character here. And you can see that character here. And you can see that character here. And you can see that there's data that's connected. There's there's data that's connected. There's there's data that's connected. There's actions in place. You can see who built actions in place. You can see who built actions in place. You can see who built it. Um, and the real issue here is it. Um, and the real issue here is it. Um, and the real issue here is within this agent action. So when Chris within this agent action. So when Chris within this agent action. So when Chris built this built this built this agent, when he was building the action agent, when he was building the action agent, when he was building the action attached to it that actually lets it be attached to it that actually lets it be attached to it that actually lets it be an agent, right? U there's a choice that an agent, right? U there's a choice that an agent, right? U there's a choice that you can make and Chris made the choice you can make and Chris made the choice you can make and Chris made the choice to say anybody anytime this action is to say anybody anytime this action is to say anybody anytime this action is used, it will use my credentials. It used, it will use my credentials. It used, it will use my credentials. It will be Chris. Chris is interacting with will be Chris. Chris is interacting with will be Chris. Chris is interacting with Salesforce. So that's fine and dandy if Salesforce. So that's fine and dandy if Salesforce. So that's fine and dandy if Chris is the only person using this Chris is the only person using this Chris is the only person using this agent. But the moment that that agent agent. But the moment that that agent agent. But the moment that that agent gets shared beyond Chris, now everybody gets shared beyond Chris, now everybody gets shared beyond Chris, now everybody who is using Chris's agent is acting as who is using Chris's agent is acting as who is using Chris's agent is acting as Chris to do all of this activity. That's Chris to do all of this activity. That's Chris to do all of this activity. That's an authorization misuse. Happens all the an authorization misuse. Happens all the an authorization misuse. Happens all the time. Um, next one is authentication time. Um, next one is authentication time. Um, next one is authentication failures. Uh, so again, now another failures. Uh, so again, now another failures. Uh, so again, now another graph. We're looking at our our graph. We're looking at our our graph. We're looking at our our hackerbot v2. Super not suspicious name hackerbot v2. Super not suspicious name hackerbot v2. Super not suspicious name at all. I wouldn't be concerned if I saw at all. I wouldn't be concerned if I saw at all. I wouldn't be concerned if I saw that. Um you can see the story again and that. Um you can see the story again and that. Um you can see the story again and we can see we're connected to maybe some we can see we're connected to maybe some we can see we're connected to maybe some critical looking data. I mean t critical looking data. I mean t critical looking data. I mean t typically internal shareepoints have typically internal shareepoints have typically internal shareepoints have critical business data and um the real critical business data and um the real critical business data and um the real issue here is that this is publicly issue here is that this is publicly issue here is that this is publicly available and it is ridiculously easy to available and it is ridiculously easy to available and it is ridiculously easy to create an agent that is unauthenticated. create an agent that is unauthenticated. create an agent that is unauthenticated. um meaning anybody who has the link to um meaning anybody who has the link to um meaning anybody who has the link to interact with that agent can public uh interact with that agent can public uh interact with that agent can public uh un unauthenticated public internal un unauthenticated public internal un unauthenticated public internal external all that jazz. So it really external all that jazz. So it really external all that jazz. So it really depends on your priorities. Like if if depends on your priorities. Like if if depends on your priorities. Like if if this is an environment where that's this is an environment where that's this is an environment where that's okay, all right, that's a conversation. okay, all right, that's a conversation. okay, all right, that's a conversation. If this is an environment where that is If this is an environment where that is If this is an environment where that is absolutely not okay and this data is absolutely not okay and this data is absolutely not okay and this data is business critical data, like that's a business critical data, like that's a business critical data, like that's a risk. It needs to be addressed. So then risk. It needs to be addressed. So then risk. It needs to be addressed. So then we talk about data and secrets handling. we talk about data and secrets handling. we talk about data and secrets handling. This uh is a very familiar one as well This uh is a very familiar one as well This uh is a very familiar one as well for all of us. This is just a simple for all of us. This is just a simple for all of us. This is just a simple flow and um again Chris Chris is our flow and um again Chris Chris is our flow and um again Chris Chris is our builder. Chris maybe needs a little more builder. Chris maybe needs a little more builder. Chris maybe needs a little more education on on how we build securely. education on on how we build securely. education on on how we build securely. Um, this flow was built using a Um, this flow was built using a Um, this flow was built using a hard-coded plain tech secret. So, it's hard-coded plain tech secret. So, it's hard-coded plain tech secret. So, it's something we're all very familiar with. something we're all very familiar with. something we're all very familiar with. Um, and what I love about this is like Um, and what I love about this is like Um, and what I love about this is like we still have a hard time convincing we still have a hard time convincing we still have a hard time convincing like professional developers that they like professional developers that they like professional developers that they shouldn't do this. And then now we're shouldn't do this. And then now we're shouldn't do this. And then now we're talking to Chris who maybe is in finance talking to Chris who maybe is in finance talking to Chris who maybe is in finance or human resources and now we have to or human resources and now we have to or human resources and now we have to explain to Chris why this is a problem. explain to Chris why this is a problem. explain to Chris why this is a problem. So, it just brings that audience back So, it just brings that audience back So, it just brings that audience back into into into perspective. So, um, this last one here, perspective. So, um, this last one here, perspective. So, um, this last one here, this is our runtime risk. Again, we're this is our runtime risk. Again, we're this is our runtime risk. Again, we're talking about an agent. This is an email talking about an agent. This is an email talking about an agent. This is an email customer support agent. Um, the cool customer support agent. Um, the cool customer support agent. Um, the cool thing about this one is that this is an thing about this one is that this is an thing about this one is that this is an autonomous agent and you can see that autonomous agent and you can see that autonomous agent and you can see that because this bottom connector is a because this bottom connector is a because this bottom connector is a trigger. So, this agent is going to be trigger. So, this agent is going to be trigger. So, this agent is going to be triggered to take action triggered to take action triggered to take action autonomously based off the flow that's autonomously based off the flow that's autonomously based off the flow that's been created back there, which is where been created back there, which is where been created back there, which is where our problem really arises. So, this is our problem really arises. So, this is our problem really arises. So, this is um a runtime risk because this is um a runtime risk because this is um a runtime risk because this is something that's going to happen when something that's going to happen when something that's going to happen when the agent is triggered. Um the issue the agent is triggered. Um the issue the agent is triggered. Um the issue with the flow is that it the choice that with the flow is that it the choice that with the flow is that it the choice that was made when we built it was do not was made when we built it was do not was made when we built it was do not filter the from field when you're filter the from field when you're filter the from field when you're sending emails or interacting with sending emails or interacting with sending emails or interacting with emails. So needless to say the choice emails. So needless to say the choice emails. So needless to say the choice that was made at that buildtime that was made at that buildtime that was made at that buildtime point now has increased the attack point now has increased the attack point now has increased the attack surface of this agent in runtime. So it surface of this agent in runtime. So it surface of this agent in runtime. So it just is a great example of how those two just is a great example of how those two just is a great example of how those two components really mesh together. So life components really mesh together. So life components really mesh together. So life is full of risks. Like that's why we're is full of risks. Like that's why we're is full of risks. Like that's why we're all here. This is Vcon. Um but in this all here. This is Vcon. Um but in this all here. This is Vcon. Um but in this environment, in these ecosystems, risk environment, in these ecosystems, risk environment, in these ecosystems, risk can be reduced. They're different. We're can be reduced. They're different. We're can be reduced. They're different. We're talking about business innovation talking about business innovation talking about business innovation platforms. We're talking about a platforms. We're talking about a platforms. We're talking about a contained environment. You can reduce contained environment. You can reduce contained environment. You can reduce risk holistically here. So that's what risk holistically here. So that's what risk holistically here. So that's what we're going to talk about next. we're going to talk about next. we're going to talk about next. So, how are we going to do that? These So, how are we going to do that? These So, how are we going to do that? These also probably look ridiculously familiar also probably look ridiculously familiar also probably look ridiculously familiar to everybody here. We're going to talk to everybody here. We're going to talk to everybody here. We're going to talk about visibility and risk assessment, about visibility and risk assessment, about visibility and risk assessment, and we're going to talk about and we're going to talk about and we're going to talk about remediation and prevention. Like, these remediation and prevention. Like, these remediation and prevention. Like, these are things we've been talking about the are things we've been talking about the are things we've been talking about the past three days, but again, they're past three days, but again, they're past three days, but again, they're going to look different because we're going to look different because we're going to look different because we're talking about citizen development talking about citizen development talking about citizen development environments. So, first off, visibility. environments. So, first off, visibility. environments. So, first off, visibility. I was super tempted to use that like I was super tempted to use that like I was super tempted to use that like Lion King meme of like everything that Lion King meme of like everything that Lion King meme of like everything that the sunlight touches and all the rest is the sunlight touches and all the rest is the sunlight touches and all the rest is shadow because like these environments shadow because like these environments shadow because like these environments are basically pure shadow land. are basically pure shadow land. are basically pure shadow land. Everything is shadow. Shadow agents, Everything is shadow. Shadow agents, Everything is shadow. Shadow agents, shadow workflows, shadow environments shadow workflows, shadow environments shadow workflows, shadow environments because we're not tied into them. And because we're not tied into them. And because we're not tied into them. And you you you make that worse. You you you you make that worse. You you you you make that worse. You compound that by saying that on average compound that by saying that on average compound that by saying that on average we're seeing 39.1% year-over-year growth we're seeing 39.1% year-over-year growth we're seeing 39.1% year-over-year growth in these environments. Um, and that was in these environments. Um, and that was in these environments. Um, and that was from 2024 again. So now with the rise of from 2024 again. So now with the rise of from 2024 again. So now with the rise of agents, um, it's just that much more agents, um, it's just that much more agents, um, it's just that much more scary. If you don't have visibility, scary. If you don't have visibility, scary. If you don't have visibility, like that's a huge problem to start like that's a huge problem to start like that's a huge problem to start with. So how can we actually gain with. So how can we actually gain with. So how can we actually gain visibility? Again, these are contained visibility? Again, these are contained visibility? Again, these are contained flat environments and we need to lean on flat environments and we need to lean on flat environments and we need to lean on the platforms. So this is a business the platforms. So this is a business the platforms. So this is a business innovation platform. It's an enterprise innovation platform. It's an enterprise innovation platform. It's an enterprise platform. lean in on the platform's platform. lean in on the platform's platform. lean in on the platform's capabilities to be able to inventory who capabilities to be able to inventory who capabilities to be able to inventory who is building what and where. That's one is building what and where. That's one is building what and where. That's one step. Then there are third-party tools step. Then there are third-party tools step. Then there are third-party tools out there that can also help you out there that can also help you out there that can also help you maintain your inventory. Um there's a maintain your inventory. Um there's a maintain your inventory. Um there's a whole ecosystem around this now built whole ecosystem around this now built whole ecosystem around this now built around these around these around these platforms. Also, um a a critical part platforms. Also, um a a critical part platforms. Also, um a a critical part here is is making sure you understand here is is making sure you understand here is is making sure you understand your data. What's your most important your data. What's your most important your data. What's your most important data in these environments and start data in these environments and start data in these environments and start there is it finance? Is it research and there is it finance? Is it research and there is it finance? Is it research and development? What environments are is development? What environments are is development? What environments are is that data in? Start to build your that data in? Start to build your that data in? Start to build your inventory from there inventory from there inventory from there out. Um, and the other thing I think is out. Um, and the other thing I think is out. Um, and the other thing I think is really cool here is that because we're really cool here is that because we're really cool here is that because we're just now starting to get into this space just now starting to get into this space just now starting to get into this space and really build security strategy. and really build security strategy. and really build security strategy. Let's set the precedent from the very Let's set the precedent from the very Let's set the precedent from the very beginning that inventory is a must. If beginning that inventory is a must. If beginning that inventory is a must. If you build it, you will document it in you build it, you will document it in you build it, you will document it in these environments. This is what we care these environments. This is what we care these environments. This is what we care about. set that precedent when you start about. set that precedent when you start about. set that precedent when you start this journey versus having to this journey versus having to this journey versus having to retroactively beg people to actually retroactively beg people to actually retroactively beg people to actually fill out fill out fill out inventory. So for risk assessment, um inventory. So for risk assessment, um inventory. So for risk assessment, um this one is a it's a little it's a this one is a it's a little it's a this one is a it's a little it's a little more challenging in these little more challenging in these little more challenging in these environments because there isn't the environments because there isn't the environments because there isn't the established tool set like we have in the established tool set like we have in the established tool set like we have in the traditional vulnerability management traditional vulnerability management traditional vulnerability management space. Um, so one of my recommendations space. Um, so one of my recommendations space. Um, so one of my recommendations here is again going back to that here is again going back to that here is again going back to that inventory. You've hopefully established inventory. You've hopefully established inventory. You've hopefully established what is most critical for you. What data what is most critical for you. What data what is most critical for you. What data is most critical for you? You've is most critical for you? You've is most critical for you? You've understood who is building what. It's understood who is building what. It's understood who is building what. It's the how part. How are they building it? the how part. How are they building it? the how part. How are they building it? That's where you start to be able to That's where you start to be able to That's where you start to be able to build your risk profile. What choices build your risk profile. What choices build your risk profile. What choices were made when these things were built? were made when these things were built? were made when these things were built? And then of course there while there's And then of course there while there's And then of course there while there's limited tools, there are tools out there limited tools, there are tools out there limited tools, there are tools out there because of the scale of these because of the scale of these because of the scale of these environments, you do want to lean in on environments, you do want to lean in on environments, you do want to lean in on automation like automated scanning is a automation like automated scanning is a automation like automated scanning is a key. Um I don't even think you know key. Um I don't even think you know key. Um I don't even think you know manual pen testing is is super built out manual pen testing is is super built out manual pen testing is is super built out in these environments yet. Um so the in these environments yet. Um so the in these environments yet. Um so the ecosystem is small but strong for ecosystem is small but strong for ecosystem is small but strong for third-party third-party third-party components. Okay, we get to the fun part components. Okay, we get to the fun part components. Okay, we get to the fun part here. Um what I love about remediation here. Um what I love about remediation here. Um what I love about remediation in these environments is that it's in these environments is that it's in these environments is that it's totally possible. Um this is the totally possible. Um this is the totally possible. Um this is the different setting than our traditional different setting than our traditional different setting than our traditional applications that we build. So the idea applications that we build. So the idea applications that we build. So the idea of silent of silent of silent remediation is feasible. You can remediation is feasible. You can remediation is feasible. You can identify sensitive data being sent into identify sensitive data being sent into identify sensitive data being sent into logs. Just remove it. Stop it. You can logs. Just remove it. Stop it. You can logs. Just remove it. Stop it. You can do that because these applications often do that because these applications often do that because these applications often are are not going to be running the are are not going to be running the are are not going to be running the front lines. Yes, they're customerf front lines. Yes, they're customerf front lines. Yes, they're customerf facing. Yes, they can be public, but facing. Yes, they can be public, but facing. Yes, they can be public, but they're not always the same as what they're not always the same as what they're not always the same as what we're dealing with professional we're dealing with professional we're dealing with professional developers, right? So, you can remove developers, right? So, you can remove developers, right? So, you can remove sensitive data. You can change the sensitive data. You can change the sensitive data. You can change the authentication settings. If in this authentication settings. If in this authentication settings. If in this environment you are not allowed to have environment you are not allowed to have environment you are not allowed to have an unauthenticated agent, change it. You an unauthenticated agent, change it. You an unauthenticated agent, change it. You can do that. Same with access settings. can do that. Same with access settings. can do that. Same with access settings. If guests are not allowed in an If guests are not allowed in an If guests are not allowed in an environment, you can set that at the at environment, you can set that at the at environment, you can set that at the at the environmental level. Again, lean on the environmental level. Again, lean on the environmental level. Again, lean on the platform capabilities to set those the platform capabilities to set those the platform capabilities to set those guardrails and remediate from there. guardrails and remediate from there. guardrails and remediate from there. Obviously, not everything can always be Obviously, not everything can always be Obviously, not everything can always be um done in an automated fashion. Well, um done in an automated fashion. Well, um done in an automated fashion. Well, we wish it could. So, manual campaigns we wish it could. So, manual campaigns we wish it could. So, manual campaigns will still be there. You can see the will still be there. You can see the will still be there. You can see the types of situations that come up there. types of situations that come up there. types of situations that come up there. It's the same that we experience in It's the same that we experience in It's the same that we experience in traditional vulnerability management, traditional vulnerability management, traditional vulnerability management, you know, like require where things you know, like require where things you know, like require where things maker is required to make a change on maker is required to make a change on maker is required to make a change on their their their own. So, this is all great to actually own. So, this is all great to actually own. So, this is all great to actually reduce risk, but then we how do we reduce risk, but then we how do we reduce risk, but then we how do we prevent that? Um, and this is really prevent that? Um, and this is really prevent that? Um, and this is really important um, because just because we've important um, because just because we've important um, because just because we've knocked down risk, we need to continue knocked down risk, we need to continue knocked down risk, we need to continue that journey. We don't want to have to that journey. We don't want to have to that journey. We don't want to have to knock down risk and then wait to do knock down risk and then wait to do knock down risk and then wait to do another campaign later. We want to another campaign later. We want to another campaign later. We want to prevent it from being introduced in the prevent it from being introduced in the prevent it from being introduced in the first place. So again, lean in on the first place. So again, lean in on the first place. So again, lean in on the platforms where there are guard rails at platforms where there are guard rails at platforms where there are guard rails at an environmental level. Set those guard an environmental level. Set those guard an environmental level. Set those guard rails first. Start at the top. That way rails first. Start at the top. That way rails first. Start at the top. That way you're not leaving up the decision up to you're not leaving up the decision up to you're not leaving up the decision up to a maker whether or not they're going to a maker whether or not they're going to a maker whether or not they're going to make the right choice. You make the make the right choice. You make the make the right choice. You make the choice for them at the environmental choice for them at the environmental choice for them at the environmental level. And then from there, um, like I level. And then from there, um, like I level. And then from there, um, like I said, automate, lean in on automation. said, automate, lean in on automation. said, automate, lean in on automation. These platforms were built for These platforms were built for These platforms were built for automation. That's the point. So use the automation. That's the point. So use the automation. That's the point. So use the platform to automate your guard rails, platform to automate your guard rails, platform to automate your guard rails, your remediation, your prevention your remediation, your prevention your remediation, your prevention strategies. And then education and strategies. And then education and strategies. And then education and creating a good culture of security. creating a good culture of security. creating a good culture of security. Those really go hand in hand. If you do Those really go hand in hand. If you do Those really go hand in hand. If you do make the choice to do a silent make the choice to do a silent make the choice to do a silent remediation, you should probably still remediation, you should probably still remediation, you should probably still reach out to the maker in some way, reach out to the maker in some way, reach out to the maker in some way, shape, or form and say, "PS, we uh we shape, or form and say, "PS, we uh we shape, or form and say, "PS, we uh we changed the authentication on your agent changed the authentication on your agent changed the authentication on your agent because you're not allowed to have a because you're not allowed to have a because you're not allowed to have a publicly available agent. This is how publicly available agent. This is how publicly available agent. This is how you would have done this on your own. you would have done this on your own. you would have done this on your own. Um, we did it for you." And then set the Um, we did it for you." And then set the Um, we did it for you." And then set the standard from the top down saying in standard from the top down saying in standard from the top down saying in this environment, we care about this environment, we care about this environment, we care about security. In this environment, you will security. In this environment, you will security. In this environment, you will follow the standards that we have set. follow the standards that we have set. follow the standards that we have set. That's like the uh soft soft skill side That's like the uh soft soft skill side That's like the uh soft soft skill side of this. But if you set that precedent of this. But if you set that precedent of this. But if you set that precedent and then back it up with technical guard and then back it up with technical guard and then back it up with technical guard rails, which you can do in these rails, which you can do in these rails, which you can do in these environments, it makes your strategy environments, it makes your strategy environments, it makes your strategy that much that much that much stronger. stronger. stronger. Um, so here for this one, it's kind of a Um, so here for this one, it's kind of a Um, so here for this one, it's kind of a it's it's a little bit of what I've it's it's a little bit of what I've it's it's a little bit of what I've already talked about like the policy is already talked about like the policy is already talked about like the policy is super important. This is going back to super important. This is going back to super important. This is going back to what we've uh messed up with shift left, what we've uh messed up with shift left, what we've uh messed up with shift left, right? We need to actually collaborate right? We need to actually collaborate right? We need to actually collaborate with the business here because these are with the business here because these are with the business here because these are business users. These are business business users. These are business business users. These are business platforms. It gives us the opportunity platforms. It gives us the opportunity platforms. It gives us the opportunity as security to go interact with an as security to go interact with an as security to go interact with an audience we don't normally work with or audience we don't normally work with or audience we don't normally work with or at least maybe the relationship is at least maybe the relationship is at least maybe the relationship is adversarial most the time and not start adversarial most the time and not start adversarial most the time and not start over but take a fresh approach and over but take a fresh approach and over but take a fresh approach and collectively say this is what we believe collectively say this is what we believe collectively say this is what we believe for security in this environment. So for security in this environment. So for security in this environment. So it's a little bit of the people side for it's a little bit of the people side for it's a little bit of the people side for that one. Um, and then when you are that one. Um, and then when you are that one. Um, and then when you are working with makers, make sure you meet working with makers, make sure you meet working with makers, make sure you meet them where they are. It's as a special them where they are. It's as a special them where they are. It's as a special call out. Like they're probably not in call out. Like they're probably not in call out. Like they're probably not in Jira and they're probably not in service Jira and they're probably not in service Jira and they're probably not in service now. So you might have to do an email now. So you might have to do an email now. So you might have to do an email campaign, but make sure you automate campaign, but make sure you automate campaign, but make sure you automate that. Like don't be sending manual that. Like don't be sending manual that. Like don't be sending manual emails out. The scope is too big. Um, emails out. The scope is too big. Um, emails out. The scope is too big. Um, but you do have to meet them where they but you do have to meet them where they but you do have to meet them where they are and speak in a language they are and speak in a language they are and speak in a language they understand, which normally means speak understand, which normally means speak understand, which normally means speak in the language of the platform. So if in the language of the platform. So if in the language of the platform. So if it if this is the fix, literally take it if this is the fix, literally take it if this is the fix, literally take the screenshots of the fix because then the screenshots of the fix because then the screenshots of the fix because then they can do it easily as a maker. So they can do it easily as a maker. So they can do it easily as a maker. So this is possible to do. This is a great this is possible to do. This is a great this is possible to do. This is a great talk. I recommend everybody uh take a talk. I recommend everybody uh take a talk. I recommend everybody uh take a picture of this and look it up. Um it's picture of this and look it up. Um it's picture of this and look it up. Um it's a blue hat talk. It's with the Microsoft a blue hat talk. It's with the Microsoft a blue hat talk. It's with the Microsoft team and Zenit and talking about team and Zenit and talking about team and Zenit and talking about Microsoft's journey to securing their Microsoft's journey to securing their Microsoft's journey to securing their own environment. and um they go into own environment. and um they go into own environment. and um they go into some fantastic detail about shared some fantastic detail about shared some fantastic detail about shared responsibility model and how they responsibility model and how they responsibility model and how they actually implemented some of these actually implemented some of these actually implemented some of these silent remediation campaigns using the silent remediation campaigns using the silent remediation campaigns using the platform. It's very very educational and platform. It's very very educational and platform. It's very very educational and it also shows that it's possible because it also shows that it's possible because it also shows that it's possible because they had a team of under five people and they had a team of under five people and they had a team of under five people and within four months they reduced the risk within four months they reduced the risk within four months they reduced the risk by by by 90%. And so it's definitely possible. So 90%. And so it's definitely possible. So 90%. And so it's definitely possible. So to wrap this up here, what's next for to wrap this up here, what's next for to wrap this up here, what's next for all of you? I recommend that you go back all of you? I recommend that you go back all of you? I recommend that you go back to your organization and you take a look to your organization and you take a look to your organization and you take a look at these environments and you assess, do at these environments and you assess, do at these environments and you assess, do you have visibility? Do you have a risk you have visibility? Do you have a risk you have visibility? Do you have a risk assessment present? Um, do you have a assessment present? Um, do you have a assessment present? Um, do you have a remediation strategy? Is prevention remediation strategy? Is prevention remediation strategy? Is prevention included in that? And if you take a look included in that? And if you take a look included in that? And if you take a look and things aren't as pearly white as you and things aren't as pearly white as you and things aren't as pearly white as you might have thought they were, just know might have thought they were, just know might have thought they were, just know that it's absolutely possible to reduce that it's absolutely possible to reduce that it's absolutely possible to reduce risk in these environments and to help risk in these environments and to help risk in these environments and to help citizen developers create more secure citizen developers create more secure citizen developers create more secure applications at the end. So there's applications at the end. So there's applications at the end. So there's always hope um in these spaces. So always hope um in these spaces. So always hope um in these spaces. So that's what I have for you that's what I have for you that's what I have for you today. I think I have time for today. I think I have time for today. I think I have time for questions. Thank you. Thank you, Kayla. Anyone in the room Thank you, Kayla. Anyone in the room Thank you, Kayla. Anyone in the room have a question? I think we have time for one and then I think we have time for one and then I think we have time for one and then Kayla, I will let you know there is one Kayla, I will let you know there is one Kayla, I will let you know there is one question in Discord. Great. We probably question in Discord. Great. We probably question in Discord. Great. We probably won't get to call out, but if you can won't get to call out, but if you can won't get to call out, but if you can check it, I will have a moment. Okay. All right. John Kavanagh. So, as a All right. John Kavanagh. So, as a All right. John Kavanagh. So, as a CISSP, I don't see any separation of CISSP, I don't see any separation of CISSP, I don't see any separation of duties in here. M and I would say this duties in here. M and I would say this duties in here. M and I would say this would be in a regulated industry a would be in a regulated industry a would be in a regulated industry a problem. Yeah. So it's cool and I'm glad problem. Yeah. So it's cool and I'm glad problem. Yeah. So it's cool and I'm glad I came and I learned a lot but that's a I came and I learned a lot but that's a I came and I learned a lot but that's a fear that I have. Yeah. Yeah. I I think fear that I have. Yeah. Yeah. I I think fear that I have. Yeah. Yeah. I I think that that's I I work a lot with that that's I I work a lot with that that's I I work a lot with regulation and policy and standards and regulation and policy and standards and regulation and policy and standards and I go into these conversations and I talk I go into these conversations and I talk I go into these conversations and I talk about this space and nobody nobody knows about this space and nobody nobody knows about this space and nobody nobody knows what I'm talking about. So yeah, we're what I'm talking about. So yeah, we're what I'm talking about. So yeah, we're working on that. We are evangelizing and working on that. We are evangelizing and working on that. We are evangelizing and we are working on how do we actually put we are working on how do we actually put we are working on how do we actually put in standards for these environments in standards for these environments in standards for these environments because they're not there today. I think because they're not there today. I think because they're not there today. I think we're good. Thank you again, Kayla, so we're good. Thank you again, Kayla, so we're good. Thank you again, Kayla, so much.
