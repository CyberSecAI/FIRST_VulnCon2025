Kind: captions Language: en Um, so my name is Alex and that's Um, so my name is Alex and that's Um, so my name is Alex and that's Jeremy. Um, if you looked at the Jeremy. Um, if you looked at the Jeremy. Um, if you looked at the program, you would note that they program, you would note that they program, you would note that they switched our bios. Um, in reality, I'm switched our bios. Um, in reality, I'm switched our bios. Um, in reality, I'm I'm Jeremy. This is Alex. Uh, I've been I'm Jeremy. This is Alex. Uh, I've been I'm Jeremy. This is Alex. Uh, I've been at Red Hat for quite some time, and uh, at Red Hat for quite some time, and uh, at Red Hat for quite some time, and uh, this topic is near and dear to me. Um, this topic is near and dear to me. Um, this topic is near and dear to me. Um, if you're here for the full two and a if you're here for the full two and a if you're here for the full two and a half hours, um, you will be half hours, um, you will be half hours, um, you will be disappointed. Um, I don't think this disappointed. Um, I don't think this disappointed. Um, I don't think this topic needs a full two and a half hours, topic needs a full two and a half hours, topic needs a full two and a half hours, but if we've got a lively discussion, we but if we've got a lively discussion, we but if we've got a lively discussion, we can go. Um, so uses for CVE root cause can go. Um, so uses for CVE root cause can go. Um, so uses for CVE root cause mapping. Before we get to this next mapping. Before we get to this next mapping. Before we get to this next slide, I kind of wanted to like like slide, I kind of wanted to like like slide, I kind of wanted to like like state why this is kind of near and dear state why this is kind of near and dear state why this is kind of near and dear to me. Um, I think, you know, I've to me. Um, I think, you know, I've to me. Um, I think, you know, I've talked with a lot of the other PERTs talked with a lot of the other PERTs talked with a lot of the other PERTs that are out there over the last couple that are out there over the last couple that are out there over the last couple of years. We're all aware the fact that of years. We're all aware the fact that of years. We're all aware the fact that the volume of CVEes continues to the volume of CVEes continues to the volume of CVEes continues to increase year-over-year. uh new software increase year-over-year. uh new software increase year-over-year. uh new software hits the market every day and ultimately hits the market every day and ultimately hits the market every day and ultimately CVEes represent mistakes in design my CVEes represent mistakes in design my CVEes represent mistakes in design my opinion. Um but the baggage of carrying opinion. Um but the baggage of carrying opinion. Um but the baggage of carrying around underlying weaknesses for long around underlying weaknesses for long around underlying weaknesses for long periods of time adds to that CVE volume periods of time adds to that CVE volume periods of time adds to that CVE volume unnecessarily. Um I also sit on the the unnecessarily. Um I also sit on the the unnecessarily. Um I also sit on the the CWE board. Um there are a bunch of CWE board. Um there are a bunch of CWE board. Um there are a bunch of brilliant people on that board, but I brilliant people on that board, but I brilliant people on that board, but I would say that one of the the challenges would say that one of the the challenges would say that one of the the challenges and I represent kind of a unique and I represent kind of a unique and I represent kind of a unique position on that board. Um it is very position on that board. Um it is very position on that board. Um it is very academic at times. I don't care about academic at times. I don't care about academic at times. I don't care about the academic part. So I'll just be blunt the academic part. So I'll just be blunt the academic part. So I'll just be blunt and and and be honest on that. What I and and and be honest on that. What I and and and be honest on that. What I care about is using the data for care about is using the data for care about is using the data for something useful like how do we use the something useful like how do we use the something useful like how do we use the CWE data that we have to improve our CWE data that we have to improve our CWE data that we have to improve our products. So, I don't think anybody's products. So, I don't think anybody's products. So, I don't think anybody's yet figured this out. Uh, otherwise I yet figured this out. Uh, otherwise I yet figured this out. Uh, otherwise I would have found it because I've Googled would have found it because I've Googled would have found it because I've Googled on this quite a bit and like I said, on this quite a bit and like I said, on this quite a bit and like I said, I've talked to other PERS. Um, so Alex I've talked to other PERS. Um, so Alex I've talked to other PERS. Um, so Alex and I came up with some suggestions that and I came up with some suggestions that and I came up with some suggestions that we are going to present. Um, and then we we are going to present. Um, and then we we are going to present. Um, and then we want to do a little uh instead of like a want to do a little uh instead of like a want to do a little uh instead of like a traditional Q&amp;A, we want to hear from traditional Q&amp;A, we want to hear from traditional Q&amp;A, we want to hear from some of you in terms of how you might some of you in terms of how you might some of you in terms of how you might use some of this data or maybe how you use some of this data or maybe how you use some of this data or maybe how you are using some of this data. So, next are using some of this data. So, next are using some of this data. So, next slide. All right. So, what problem we slide. All right. So, what problem we slide. All right. So, what problem we trying to solve? talked with that a trying to solve? talked with that a trying to solve? talked with that a little bit about that a little bit little bit about that a little bit little bit about that a little bit methodologies and challenges the methodologies and challenges the methodologies and challenges the benefits and then we can get into that benefits and then we can get into that benefits and then we can get into that discussion on what everybody else is discussion on what everybody else is discussion on what everybody else is doing. Next doing. Next doing. Next slide. All right. So, uh, as a software slide. All right. So, uh, as a software slide. All right. So, uh, as a software vendor, um, we talked a little bit about vendor, um, we talked a little bit about vendor, um, we talked a little bit about how the the volume continues to increase how the the volume continues to increase how the the volume continues to increase over time. We're always finding over time. We're always finding over time. We're always finding ourselves fixing CVEes. It's not really ourselves fixing CVEes. It's not really ourselves fixing CVEes. It's not really scalable. Um, but I think the other scalable. Um, but I think the other scalable. Um, but I think the other problem here is like how do you problem here is like how do you problem here is like how do you prioritize kind of an overload of prioritize kind of an overload of prioritize kind of an overload of information? And I I I put dasty here. information? And I I I put dasty here. information? And I I I put dasty here. Dasty is not necessarily a source of Dasty is not necessarily a source of Dasty is not necessarily a source of weakness. Um but when you can consider weakness. Um but when you can consider weakness. Um but when you can consider the amount of information that goes in the amount of information that goes in the amount of information that goes in front of software developers, it can be front of software developers, it can be front of software developers, it can be noise, right? So we have a lot of noise noise, right? So we have a lot of noise noise, right? So we have a lot of noise in front of our software developers and in front of our software developers and in front of our software developers and I I get to be the bad guy most of the I I get to be the bad guy most of the I I get to be the bad guy most of the times at Red Hat and saying, "Okay, here times at Red Hat and saying, "Okay, here times at Red Hat and saying, "Okay, here are your priorities. You got to fix all are your priorities. You got to fix all are your priorities. You got to fix all these these vulnerabilities and I'm not these these vulnerabilities and I'm not these these vulnerabilities and I'm not very wellliked." So if you put a bunch very wellliked." So if you put a bunch very wellliked." So if you put a bunch of weaknesses in front of them as well of weaknesses in front of them as well of weaknesses in front of them as well and a bunch of uh scanning results, then and a bunch of uh scanning results, then and a bunch of uh scanning results, then where do you find time to get it all where do you find time to get it all where do you find time to get it all done? Um so part of our methodology that done? Um so part of our methodology that done? Um so part of our methodology that we'll go into in a little bit is not we'll go into in a little bit is not we'll go into in a little bit is not just saying great, we have CWE data, but just saying great, we have CWE data, but just saying great, we have CWE data, but it's how do you make that that data it's how do you make that that data it's how do you make that that data useful? Um so sometimes we're just useful? Um so sometimes we're just useful? Um so sometimes we're just collecting data for the sake of collecting data for the sake of collecting data for the sake of collecting data and that that's kind of collecting data and that that's kind of collecting data and that that's kind of a problem. And so this is again we want a problem. And so this is again we want a problem. And so this is again we want to address that. um is the software to address that. um is the software to address that. um is the software secure? You know, if you are a consumer, secure? You know, if you are a consumer, secure? You know, if you are a consumer, if you're a customer, the one of the if you're a customer, the one of the if you're a customer, the one of the questions that you care about is the the questions that you care about is the the questions that you care about is the the state of your software from a security state of your software from a security state of your software from a security perspective. Um and also keeping in mind perspective. Um and also keeping in mind perspective. Um and also keeping in mind that vulnerability remediation is that vulnerability remediation is that vulnerability remediation is expensive, right? So you're a customer expensive, right? So you're a customer expensive, right? So you're a customer and you get a bunch of security and you get a bunch of security and you get a bunch of security advisories every week. That's time that advisories every week. That's time that advisories every week. That's time that you have to spend patching your systems, you have to spend patching your systems, you have to spend patching your systems, you know, pausing things, you know, you know, pausing things, you know, you know, pausing things, you know, taking taking systems down, right? So, taking taking systems down, right? So, taking taking systems down, right? So, it can be quite expensive. We really do it can be quite expensive. We really do it can be quite expensive. We really do ultimately want to reduce the number of ultimately want to reduce the number of ultimately want to reduce the number of those vulnerabilities. Next slide. So, those vulnerabilities. Next slide. So, those vulnerabilities. Next slide. So, looking at some of the origins for looking at some of the origins for looking at some of the origins for weaknesses, weaknesses, weaknesses, uh weaknesses are not a not an unknown uh weaknesses are not a not an unknown uh weaknesses are not a not an unknown thing. Um you look at the definition thing. Um you look at the definition thing. Um you look at the definition there, this is the you know the there, this is the you know the there, this is the you know the underlying you know cause for you know underlying you know cause for you know underlying you know cause for you know the vulnerabilities. the vulnerabilities. the vulnerabilities. um it exists in firmware, hardware um um it exists in firmware, hardware um um it exists in firmware, hardware um and contributes to those and contributes to those and contributes to those vulnerabilities. Um if you look at the vulnerabilities. Um if you look at the vulnerabilities. Um if you look at the threat models, we we discover uh threat models, we we discover uh threat models, we we discover uh weaknesses as part of our threat models. weaknesses as part of our threat models. weaknesses as part of our threat models. There's the of course the the SASD There's the of course the the SASD There's the of course the the SASD especially results like just bad code in especially results like just bad code in especially results like just bad code in general. Um and I think you know I was general. Um and I think you know I was general. Um and I think you know I was talking with somebody I think it was um talking with somebody I think it was um talking with somebody I think it was um somebody from MITER yesterday about the somebody from MITER yesterday about the somebody from MITER yesterday about the uh the threat intelligence part and uh the threat intelligence part and uh the threat intelligence part and they're like you know we're seeing more they're like you know we're seeing more they're like you know we're seeing more and more need for some of this data. and more need for some of this data. and more need for some of this data. What's driving that? I know just by What's driving that? I know just by What's driving that? I know just by being in in my space there at Red Hat being in in my space there at Red Hat being in in my space there at Red Hat for the last couple of years, we've seen for the last couple of years, we've seen for the last couple of years, we've seen a lot of interest in threat intelligence a lot of interest in threat intelligence a lot of interest in threat intelligence is taking uh data from a number of is taking uh data from a number of is taking uh data from a number of different sources, not just weakness different sources, not just weakness different sources, not just weakness data, but then trying to, you know, make data, but then trying to, you know, make data, but then trying to, you know, make some sense out of that data to determine some sense out of that data to determine some sense out of that data to determine where are where are our most risky where are where are our most risky where are where are our most risky components or products? Uh what are the components or products? Uh what are the components or products? Uh what are the ones we need to be, you know, paying ones we need to be, you know, paying ones we need to be, you know, paying attention to? It's it's kind of solving attention to? It's it's kind of solving attention to? It's it's kind of solving some of those those questions. Um so um some of those those questions. Um so um some of those those questions. Um so um and lastly here we've got the root cause and lastly here we've got the root cause and lastly here we've got the root cause mapping that comes in um from CBE mapping that comes in um from CBE mapping that comes in um from CBE analysis right so we've got lots of analysis right so we've got lots of analysis right so we've got lots of sources next so finding commonality in sources next so finding commonality in sources next so finding commonality in the data um next the data um next the data um next slide um if you look at each one of slide um if you look at each one of slide um if you look at each one of these you've got your threat model these you've got your threat model these you've got your threat model you've got patterns you've got patterns you've got patterns uh and you've got um a focus kind of on uh and you've got um a focus kind of on uh and you've got um a focus kind of on a CWE family if you look at kind of the a CWE family if you look at kind of the a CWE family if you look at kind of the way of categorizing some of those way of categorizing some of those way of categorizing some of those patterns patterns patterns um within your DASI results. Uh these um within your DASI results. Uh these um within your DASI results. Uh these are also patterns. Um the point we're are also patterns. Um the point we're are also patterns. Um the point we're trying to kind of make with this is uh trying to kind of make with this is uh trying to kind of make with this is uh all of this can map back to an all of this can map back to an all of this can map back to an underlying CWE ID, right? We've got a underlying CWE ID, right? We've got a underlying CWE ID, right? We've got a great taxonomy out there and part of the great taxonomy out there and part of the great taxonomy out there and part of the purpose of that taxonomy is helping to purpose of that taxonomy is helping to purpose of that taxonomy is helping to just have that commonality across all of just have that commonality across all of just have that commonality across all of those those u the landscape so to speak, those those u the landscape so to speak, those those u the landscape so to speak, right? Everything from could happen to right? Everything from could happen to right? Everything from could happen to it already did happen with a it already did happen with a it already did happen with a vulnerability. Next slide. vulnerability. Next slide. vulnerability. Next slide. So I think step one and this is I'm So I think step one and this is I'm So I think step one and this is I'm taking a little bit of liberty here like taking a little bit of liberty here like taking a little bit of liberty here like this is if I was you know giving this is if I was you know giving this is if I was you know giving direction to a particular you know direction to a particular you know direction to a particular you know company or someone I would say okay well company or someone I would say okay well company or someone I would say okay well you know you have to make a a decision you know you have to make a a decision you know you have to make a a decision and and and sit down and say okay well and and and sit down and say okay well and and and sit down and say okay well we are going to blend our data somehow we are going to blend our data somehow we are going to blend our data somehow we are going to you know take our threat we are going to you know take our threat we are going to you know take our threat models we're going to take our root models we're going to take our root models we're going to take our root cause mapping and we are going to use cause mapping and we are going to use cause mapping and we are going to use the same identifiers and we're going to the same identifiers and we're going to the same identifiers and we're going to operate off of that same data that that operate off of that same data that that operate off of that same data that that base that set of data right So there is base that set of data right So there is base that set of data right So there is work involved in actually mapping work involved in actually mapping work involved in actually mapping between um and blending some of that between um and blending some of that between um and blending some of that data from all of those different data from all of those different data from all of those different sources. But uh the end result is if you sources. But uh the end result is if you sources. But uh the end result is if you have um like if if you if you built it have um like if if you if you built it have um like if if you if you built it upon that that CVE taxonomy, you can do upon that that CVE taxonomy, you can do upon that that CVE taxonomy, you can do some really cool things with that that some really cool things with that that some really cool things with that that data that CWE data and the counts and data that CWE data and the counts and data that CWE data and the counts and the mapping to components. Um so how do the mapping to components. Um so how do the mapping to components. Um so how do you filter through that? And this is you filter through that? And this is you filter through that? And this is really the the heart of kind of what we really the the heart of kind of what we really the the heart of kind of what we wanted to get at. Um, Alex has quite a wanted to get at. Um, Alex has quite a wanted to get at. Um, Alex has quite a bit more uh fun digging through the bit more uh fun digging through the bit more uh fun digging through the data, so he is gonna talk through the data, so he is gonna talk through the data, so he is gonna talk through the next couple of slides. next couple of slides. next couple of slides. Thanks. All right, thanks. Um, can we go Thanks. All right, thanks. Um, can we go Thanks. All right, thanks. Um, can we go to the next slide? Great. So, um, we to the next slide? Great. So, um, we to the next slide? Great. So, um, we wanted to use some practical examples to wanted to use some practical examples to wanted to use some practical examples to kind of discuss and illustrate this kind of discuss and illustrate this kind of discuss and illustrate this point. So, um, one of the things that's, point. So, um, one of the things that's, point. So, um, one of the things that's, uh, great about C.WE is that it has a uh, great about C.WE is that it has a uh, great about C.WE is that it has a flexibility, right? So because it maps flexibility, right? So because it maps flexibility, right? So because it maps things from a high level to a low level, things from a high level to a low level, things from a high level to a low level, you're able to based off of the audience you're able to based off of the audience you're able to based off of the audience that you have or you know the the that you have or you know the the that you have or you know the the context that you have whether you're context that you have whether you're context that you have whether you're looking at a framework or you're looking looking at a framework or you're looking looking at a framework or you're looking at standards but whatever it may be you at standards but whatever it may be you at standards but whatever it may be you have uh a choice of granularity when we have uh a choice of granularity when we have uh a choice of granularity when we looked at some of our own data right so looked at some of our own data right so looked at some of our own data right so to see for example from the year of 20 to see for example from the year of 20 to see for example from the year of 20 from last year from 2024 what were the from last year from 2024 what were the from last year from 2024 what were the most common CWEs and the most impacted most common CWEs and the most impacted most common CWEs and the most impacted components for vulnerabilities that components for vulnerabilities that components for vulnerabilities that impacted RE excluding kernel um this was impacted RE excluding kernel um this was impacted RE excluding kernel um this was kind of the kind of the kind of the uh of the let's say the top five. Now um uh of the let's say the top five. Now um uh of the let's say the top five. Now um the CWEs you see here are pretty much the CWEs you see here are pretty much the CWEs you see here are pretty much all classes. I think one or two might be all classes. I think one or two might be all classes. I think one or two might be pillars. So they're slightly higher pillars. So they're slightly higher pillars. So they're slightly higher level. The the real objective here isn't level. The the real objective here isn't level. The the real objective here isn't so much to necessarily talk about uh you so much to necessarily talk about uh you so much to necessarily talk about uh you know exactly what was going on you know know exactly what was going on you know know exactly what was going on you know with WebKit GTK in 2024. It was more to with WebKit GTK in 2024. It was more to with WebKit GTK in 2024. It was more to illustrate the point that as you'll see illustrate the point that as you'll see illustrate the point that as you'll see on the next slide but um you're able to on the next slide but um you're able to on the next slide but um you're able to map things depending on the audience map things depending on the audience map things depending on the audience level. So here this isn't necessarily level. So here this isn't necessarily level. So here this isn't necessarily something this isn't the kind of C.WE we something this isn't the kind of C.WE we something this isn't the kind of C.WE we data that you would necessarily pass to data that you would necessarily pass to data that you would necessarily pass to engineering because it is kind of higher engineering because it is kind of higher engineering because it is kind of higher level, right? Memory buffer errors on level, right? Memory buffer errors on level, right? Memory buffer errors on its own isn't necessarily something its own isn't necessarily something its own isn't necessarily something that's specific enough to engineering to that's specific enough to engineering to that's specific enough to engineering to help make it actionable. If we look at help make it actionable. If we look at help make it actionable. If we look at the next slide on that course. So the the next slide on that course. So the the next slide on that course. So the the other thing I would say on this is the other thing I would say on this is the other thing I would say on this is you know as an option for presenting you know as an option for presenting you know as an option for presenting this information to engineering instead this information to engineering instead this information to engineering instead of saying hey here's a specific you know of saying hey here's a specific you know of saying hey here's a specific you know instance that we found where this memory instance that we found where this memory instance that we found where this memory issue and you could get to the lower issue and you could get to the lower issue and you could get to the lower level CWE for that you know you can level CWE for that you know you can level CWE for that you know you can present a bunch of data to them and say present a bunch of data to them and say present a bunch of data to them and say collectively within this particular collectively within this particular collectively within this particular component this is a weak area in in component this is a weak area in in component this is a weak area in in general right so you need to do general right so you need to do general right so you need to do something about that weak component. something about that weak component. something about that weak component. Yep. On the next slide, you're seeing Yep. On the next slide, you're seeing Yep. On the next slide, you're seeing the exact same things but basically with the exact same things but basically with the exact same things but basically with a more specific CWE mapping. So this is a more specific CWE mapping. So this is a more specific CWE mapping. So this is where it becomes let's say more where it becomes let's say more where it becomes let's say more actionable at a lower level because actionable at a lower level because actionable at a lower level because instead of just saying for example instead of just saying for example instead of just saying for example something like memory buffer errors you something like memory buffer errors you something like memory buffer errors you can start saying yeah you have out of can start saying yeah you have out of can start saying yeah you have out of bounds reads you have exposure to bounds reads you have exposure to bounds reads you have exposure to sensitive information to an unauthorized sensitive information to an unauthorized sensitive information to an unauthorized act. Basically the point is um because act. Basically the point is um because act. Basically the point is um because of this taring that you have with CLE um of this taring that you have with CLE um of this taring that you have with CLE um depending on the audience again that you depending on the audience again that you depending on the audience again that you have in front of you you're able to um have in front of you you're able to um have in front of you you're able to um go into more or less detail but since it go into more or less detail but since it go into more or less detail but since it is all mapped you don't necessarily lose is all mapped you don't necessarily lose is all mapped you don't necessarily lose the um the thread right so you know that the um the thread right so you know that the um the thread right so you know that you're still talking about the same you're still talking about the same you're still talking about the same thing even if it's at a higher level thing even if it's at a higher level thing even if it's at a higher level because higher level CWES then map to because higher level CWES then map to because higher level CWES then map to lower and lower level CWEs so you can be lower and lower level CWEs so you can be lower and lower level CWEs so you can be sure that like there's a there's a a sure that like there's a there's a a sure that like there's a there's a a thread that's keeping everything kind of thread that's keeping everything kind of thread that's keeping everything kind of tight tied together. Um in fact on the tight tied together. Um in fact on the tight tied together. Um in fact on the next slide um when we talk about it as a next slide um when we talk about it as a next slide um when we talk about it as a connecting thread so the point is kind connecting thread so the point is kind connecting thread so the point is kind of this right like I was saying memory of this right like I was saying memory of this right like I was saying memory buffer errors can map to things that are buffer errors can map to things that are buffer errors can map to things that are a little more specific out-of-bound a little more specific out-of-bound a little more specific out-of-bound reads that might be more useful to reads that might be more useful to reads that might be more useful to engineering right there are cees out engineering right there are cees out engineering right there are cees out there that are like insecure there that are like insecure there that are like insecure configuration which on its own is a configuration which on its own is a configuration which on its own is a little vague that might be fine if little vague that might be fine if little vague that might be fine if you're trying to do a you know more high you're trying to do a you know more high you're trying to do a you know more high level report you want to kind of just level report you want to kind of just level report you want to kind of just have a general overview of what's what's have a general overview of what's what's have a general overview of what's what's happening let's say with your products happening let's say with your products happening let's say with your products but if you're going to pass something to but if you're going to pass something to but if you're going to pass something to engineering and you say we want you to engineering and you say we want you to engineering and you say we want you to fix something it's helpful to have fix something it's helpful to have fix something it's helpful to have something more specific specific then something more specific specific then something more specific specific then you know yeah take a look at this you know yeah take a look at this you know yeah take a look at this component has an insecure configuration component has an insecure configuration component has an insecure configuration that can mean a bunch of things right that can mean a bunch of things right that can mean a bunch of things right and the other big advantage because like and the other big advantage because like and the other big advantage because like uh like we'd already mentioned right the uh like we'd already mentioned right the uh like we'd already mentioned right the standardizing common language so standardizing common language so standardizing common language so essentially the fact that because of essentially the fact that because of essentially the fact that because of these uh these different tiers of these uh these different tiers of these uh these different tiers of mapping between uh different levels of mapping between uh different levels of mapping between uh different levels of specificity you're kind of guaranteeing specificity you're kind of guaranteeing specificity you're kind of guaranteeing that even if you're talking at a very that even if you're talking at a very that even if you're talking at a very high level using specific terminology high level using specific terminology high level using specific terminology mentioning specific kinds of cole which mentioning specific kinds of cole which mentioning specific kinds of cole which are maybe classes right or or categories are maybe classes right or or categories are maybe classes right or or categories or views you're um you can still be sure or views you're um you can still be sure or views you're um you can still be sure that um when you're then mapping those that um when you're then mapping those that um when you're then mapping those things down to like a lower level, things down to like a lower level, things down to like a lower level, you're maintaining you're maintaining you're maintaining a a parody so so to speak, right? Like a a parody so so to speak, right? Like a a parody so so to speak, right? Like you know that um it can't be you know that um it can't be you know that um it can't be misinterpreted because there's a limited misinterpreted because there's a limited misinterpreted because there's a limited number of thing of of you know lower number of thing of of you know lower number of thing of of you know lower level CWEs that could be associated with level CWEs that could be associated with level CWEs that could be associated with a specific topic with a specific higher a specific topic with a specific higher a specific topic with a specific higher level level level C.WE. Um yeah. So I'll turn it over to C.WE. Um yeah. So I'll turn it over to C.WE. Um yeah. So I'll turn it over to Jeremy. I want to say one more thing on Jeremy. I want to say one more thing on Jeremy. I want to say one more thing on both of these options here. You'll note both of these options here. You'll note both of these options here. You'll note we put five components, right? There was we put five components, right? There was we put five components, right? There was a reason for that. We could probably a reason for that. We could probably a reason for that. We could probably have listed out like all the components have listed out like all the components have listed out like all the components that go into Redhead Enterprise Linux that go into Redhead Enterprise Linux that go into Redhead Enterprise Linux for instance, that's a lot of data for instance, that's a lot of data for instance, that's a lot of data that's useless for engineering in my that's useless for engineering in my that's useless for engineering in my opinion. Um, but if you can sort through opinion. Um, but if you can sort through opinion. Um, but if you can sort through this data and say, okay, well, you know, this data and say, okay, well, you know, this data and say, okay, well, you know, of all of the vulnerabilities reported, of all of the vulnerabilities reported, of all of the vulnerabilities reported, you know, using root cause mapping, we you know, using root cause mapping, we you know, using root cause mapping, we can say these were the components where can say these were the components where can say these were the components where we saw most of the vulnerabilities. we saw most of the vulnerabilities. we saw most of the vulnerabilities. you're prioritizing that data set. You you're prioritizing that data set. You you're prioritizing that data set. You know, maybe it's five components, maybe know, maybe it's five components, maybe know, maybe it's five components, maybe it's 10, right? But the point is is to, it's 10, right? But the point is is to, it's 10, right? But the point is is to, you know, chip, you know, chisel away, you know, chip, you know, chisel away, you know, chip, you know, chisel away, chip away at that a little bit over chip away at that a little bit over chip away at that a little bit over time, right? And, you know, as a as a time, right? And, you know, as a as a time, right? And, you know, as a as a product security organization product security organization product security organization especially, you can provide that especially, you can provide that especially, you can provide that information to engineering in smaller information to engineering in smaller information to engineering in smaller chunks and say, okay, well, maybe focus chunks and say, okay, well, maybe focus chunks and say, okay, well, maybe focus on just these particular components. So, on just these particular components. So, on just these particular components. So, some additional suggestions here. Um, some additional suggestions here. Um, some additional suggestions here. Um, you really need to tailor the results to you really need to tailor the results to you really need to tailor the results to the audience, right? So if you're the audience, right? So if you're the audience, right? So if you're working with product managers, you might working with product managers, you might working with product managers, you might want to use those higher level CWEs. Um want to use those higher level CWEs. Um want to use those higher level CWEs. Um if you're working directly with if you're working directly with if you're working directly with engineering uh teams, engineering leads, engineering uh teams, engineering leads, engineering uh teams, engineering leads, you might want to use the lower level you might want to use the lower level you might want to use the lower level CWE data to you know be a little bit CWE data to you know be a little bit CWE data to you know be a little bit more communicative on on the specifics. more communicative on on the specifics. more communicative on on the specifics. Um also remember your upstream Um also remember your upstream Um also remember your upstream contributors uh help uh you know this is contributors uh help uh you know this is contributors uh help uh you know this is especially relevant for Red Hat, right? especially relevant for Red Hat, right? especially relevant for Red Hat, right? We we work in this open source space. Um We we work in this open source space. Um We we work in this open source space. Um a lot of the components that we pull a lot of the components that we pull a lot of the components that we pull down are developed upstream, right? So, down are developed upstream, right? So, down are developed upstream, right? So, you know, if you're trying to make a you know, if you're trying to make a you know, if you're trying to make a change to some of those components, you change to some of those components, you change to some of those components, you don't want to necessarily fork it in, don't want to necessarily fork it in, don't want to necessarily fork it in, you know, internally and with, you know, you know, internally and with, you know, you know, internally and with, you know, as a vendor, right? You want to work as a vendor, right? You want to work as a vendor, right? You want to work back upstream and give them that data as back upstream and give them that data as back upstream and give them that data as well. Um, integrate those metrics into well. Um, integrate those metrics into well. Um, integrate those metrics into your development pipelines, right? your development pipelines, right? your development pipelines, right? There's ways of, you know, working with There's ways of, you know, working with There's ways of, you know, working with your pipeline teams to say, all right, your pipeline teams to say, all right, your pipeline teams to say, all right, um, maybe these are some checks that um, maybe these are some checks that um, maybe these are some checks that that can be run um, as part of that that can be run um, as part of that that can be run um, as part of that pipeline work. Um the last thing I'll pipeline work. Um the last thing I'll pipeline work. Um the last thing I'll say here on this uh this this bullet um say here on this uh this this bullet um say here on this uh this this bullet um is it's not just limited to just fixing is it's not just limited to just fixing is it's not just limited to just fixing code, right? I think sometimes we tend code, right? I think sometimes we tend code, right? I think sometimes we tend to think um all right well this weakness to think um all right well this weakness to think um all right well this weakness or this collection of weaknesses in this or this collection of weaknesses in this or this collection of weaknesses in this particular component just needs a particular component just needs a particular component just needs a complete code change. Um, I think the complete code change. Um, I think the complete code change. Um, I think the example that somebody pointed out to me example that somebody pointed out to me example that somebody pointed out to me uh from our kernel team uh a couple of uh from our kernel team uh a couple of uh from our kernel team uh a couple of months ago was well most of the months ago was well most of the months ago was well most of the weaknesses they see are specific to this weaknesses they see are specific to this weaknesses they see are specific to this type of memory management that's being type of memory management that's being type of memory management that's being done and that's not something that's done and that's not something that's done and that's not something that's going to change, right? So you can also going to change, right? So you can also going to change, right? So you can also implement guard rails, security implement guard rails, security implement guard rails, security practices, controls. there are other practices, controls. there are other practices, controls. there are other things that that you can work on things that that you can work on things that that you can work on collectively as a as a vendor as a collectively as a as a vendor as a collectively as a as a vendor as a product team to help minimize those product team to help minimize those product team to help minimize those underlying weaknesses so that those underlying weaknesses so that those underlying weaknesses so that those those vulnerabilities you know um those vulnerabilities you know um those vulnerabilities you know um decrease over time. Um, this is the decrease over time. Um, this is the decrease over time. Um, this is the point in the conversation. We tried to point in the conversation. We tried to point in the conversation. We tried to keep our portion of this fairly quick keep our portion of this fairly quick keep our portion of this fairly quick because we wanted to actually not, like because we wanted to actually not, like because we wanted to actually not, like I said, not do a Q&amp;A per se, but want to I said, not do a Q&amp;A per se, but want to I said, not do a Q&amp;A per se, but want to hear from from folks in the audience hear from from folks in the audience hear from from folks in the audience what you're doing to use C.WE data. And what you're doing to use C.WE data. And what you're doing to use C.WE data. And if nobody raises their hand, I won't be if nobody raises their hand, I won't be if nobody raises their hand, I won't be really surprised because again, this is really surprised because again, this is really surprised because again, this is kind of what I've seen in in unofficial kind of what I've seen in in unofficial kind of what I've seen in in unofficial surveying of of of people I've talked surveying of of of people I've talked surveying of of of people I've talked with in the back. We have a another with in the back. We have a another with in the back. We have a another microphone. Heard this one away because it like Heard this one away because it like Heard this one away because it like moved over two more. So that's really great. But how more. So that's really great. But how more. So that's really great. But how you leverage then CW data to then you leverage then CW data to then you leverage then CW data to then address root cause or vulnerability address root cause or vulnerability address root cause or vulnerability class or squash vulnerability classes. class or squash vulnerability classes. class or squash vulnerability classes. And then are you looking as well at And then are you looking as well at And then are you looking as well at vulnerability data to then have a better vulnerability data to then have a better vulnerability data to then have a better conversation with your software team on conversation with your software team on conversation with your software team on hey these things could potentially turn hey these things could potentially turn hey these things could potentially turn into something malicious because this into something malicious because this into something malicious because this pattern of things are more frequent in pattern of things are more frequent in pattern of things are more frequent in exploited vulnerability or something exploited vulnerability or something exploited vulnerability or something else. else. else. That's that's actually the intent. I That's that's actually the intent. I That's that's actually the intent. I think part of making this useful is not think part of making this useful is not think part of making this useful is not just I mean I I could compose an email just I mean I I could compose an email just I mean I I could compose an email tomorrow to a particular engineering tomorrow to a particular engineering tomorrow to a particular engineering team and say these are your top you know team and say these are your top you know team and say these are your top you know weaknesses right that's that could be weaknesses right that's that could be weaknesses right that's that could be useful depends on your the engineering useful depends on your the engineering useful depends on your the engineering your team you're talking to um you guys your team you're talking to um you guys your team you're talking to um you guys are uh there's a second part to this are uh there's a second part to this are uh there's a second part to this really it was kind of unplanned but it really it was kind of unplanned but it really it was kind of unplanned but it worked out really well. So, uh, Rogue, worked out really well. So, uh, Rogue, worked out really well. So, uh, Rogue, who just walked in in the back, is who just walked in in the back, is who just walked in in the back, is giving a presentation tomorrow to talk giving a presentation tomorrow to talk giving a presentation tomorrow to talk about how to actually implement some of about how to actually implement some of about how to actually implement some of this this data into the threat modeling, this this data into the threat modeling, this this data into the threat modeling, sorry, the threat research type of uh sorry, the threat research type of uh sorry, the threat research type of uh work that can be done more by like an work that can be done more by like an work that can be done more by like an like an SDL focused team. Um, so intent like an SDL focused team. Um, so intent like an SDL focused team. Um, so intent there is really kind of tying in some of there is really kind of tying in some of there is really kind of tying in some of this data into maybe some of the other this data into maybe some of the other this data into maybe some of the other activities that are happening in your activities that are happening in your activities that are happening in your organization. And that may be that may organization. And that may be that may organization. And that may be that may be more useful because it's like it's a be more useful because it's like it's a be more useful because it's like it's a little bit more focused and it's a it's little bit more focused and it's a it's little bit more focused and it's a it's the same kind of it's a more simplified the same kind of it's a more simplified the same kind of it's a more simplified message back to engineering teams rather message back to engineering teams rather message back to engineering teams rather than them being hit by multiple people. than them being hit by multiple people. than them being hit by multiple people. Right. Right. Right. Yeah. Just as a like a semi-practical Yeah. Just as a like a semi-practical Yeah. Just as a like a semi-practical example, part of the reason why we example, part of the reason why we example, part of the reason why we include CWE data on our v include CWE data on our v include CWE data on our v vulnerabilities is because for example, vulnerabilities is because for example, vulnerabilities is because for example, if you're thinking about if you're thinking about if you're thinking about um SAS, right, in in in a product's uh um SAS, right, in in in a product's uh um SAS, right, in in in a product's uh like build process like in a build like build process like in a build like build process like in a build pipeline. So um SAS will obviously come pipeline. So um SAS will obviously come pipeline. So um SAS will obviously come out with a bunch of seeds CWES, right? out with a bunch of seeds CWES, right? out with a bunch of seeds CWES, right? For a given uh a given product, a given For a given uh a given product, a given For a given uh a given product, a given scan, you can leverage the C.WE we data scan, you can leverage the C.WE we data scan, you can leverage the C.WE we data that you see from vulnerabilities to that you see from vulnerabilities to that you see from vulnerabilities to prioritize the list of CWEs that you see prioritize the list of CWEs that you see prioritize the list of CWEs that you see from the SA SAS output which is like a from the SA SAS output which is like a from the SA SAS output which is like a feedback loop right so as you see things feedback loop right so as you see things feedback loop right so as you see things either increasing or decreasing you can either increasing or decreasing you can either increasing or decreasing you can kind of understand how to better tune kind of understand how to better tune kind of understand how to better tune like your security gates for example like your security gates for example like your security gates for example yeah but on that point are you yeah but on that point are you yeah but on that point are you prioritizing or are you looking at prioritizing or are you looking at prioritizing or are you looking at specific classes of CWE or group of CWE specific classes of CWE or group of CWE specific classes of CWE or group of CWE as more dangerous than other classes of as more dangerous than other classes of as more dangerous than other classes of CW like remote code execution memory CW like remote code execution memory CW like remote code execution memory corruption uh input validation classes corruption uh input validation classes corruption uh input validation classes versus pat traversal. versus pat traversal. versus pat traversal. That's exactly why I wanted to have this That's exactly why I wanted to have this That's exactly why I wanted to have this conversation with the audience like this conversation with the audience like this conversation with the audience like this is good feedback, right? Like this not is good feedback, right? Like this not is good feedback, right? Like this not something that we're doing at the something that we're doing at the something that we're doing at the moment, but that's I think that's a moment, but that's I think that's a moment, but that's I think that's a great recommendation. great recommendation. great recommendation. Thank you. The shortest The shortest The shortest part. Uh yeah. part. Uh yeah. part. Uh yeah. Um on the talk yesterday I talked about Um on the talk yesterday I talked about Um on the talk yesterday I talked about whatever trying to map um to good CWE whatever trying to map um to good CWE whatever trying to map um to good CWE data but the nice thing about CWES is it data but the nice thing about CWES is it data but the nice thing about CWES is it applies to CVEes and also internal applies to CVEes and also internal applies to CVEes and also internal vulnerabilities. So you can use them for vulnerabilities. So you can use them for vulnerabilities. So you can use them for everything all classes of everything all classes of everything all classes of vulnerabilities which is good. So how my vulnerabilities which is good. So how my vulnerabilities which is good. So how my thinking was thinking was thinking was that all that all that all the data points or intersections across the data points or intersections across the data points or intersections across the dev sec ops pipeline you mentioned the dev sec ops pipeline you mentioned the dev sec ops pipeline you mentioned SAS DAS but all the tools right through SAS DAS but all the tools right through SAS DAS but all the tools right through the bug bounty and etc runtime you can the bug bounty and etc runtime you can the bug bounty and etc runtime you can all use CWES and the idea would be that all use CWES and the idea would be that all use CWES and the idea would be that you create campaigns around classes of you create campaigns around classes of you create campaigns around classes of vulnerabilities and you go after them to vulnerabilities and you go after them to vulnerabilities and you go after them to eradicate those classes that's you know eradicate those classes that's you know eradicate those classes that's you know a very effective way so you prioritize a very effective way so you prioritize a very effective way so you prioritize and then you eradicate by whatever it is and then you eradicate by whatever it is and then you eradicate by whatever it is maybe it's information disclosure or maybe it's information disclosure or maybe it's information disclosure or whatever the thing is that's you know whatever the thing is that's you know whatever the thing is that's you know and then you have a holistic view of and then you have a holistic view of and then you have a holistic view of that particular weakness and all the that particular weakness and all the that particular weakness and all the tools speak the language of CWE or you tools speak the language of CWE or you tools speak the language of CWE or you can map all the results to CW so that's can map all the results to CW so that's can map all the results to CW so that's that's why I think it's very very that's why I think it's very very that's why I think it's very very powerful uh even if it doesn't seem to powerful uh even if it doesn't seem to powerful uh even if it doesn't seem to be a common mature practice yet agreed any other comments out Excuse Excuse Excuse me.

I don't know what to call it. Um I look I don't know what to call it. Um I look I don't know what to call it. Um I look over at Ken because Ken's been here over at Ken because Ken's been here over at Ken because Ken's been here longer than I have. Um I uh this stuff longer than I have. Um I uh this stuff longer than I have. Um I uh this stuff is dated now, but I actually gave a is dated now, but I actually gave a is dated now, but I actually gave a presentation on this at the first presentation on this at the first presentation on this at the first conference in Koala Lumpur for hour and conference in Koala Lumpur for hour and conference in Koala Lumpur for hour and a half, two hours. Um when I was at a half, two hours. Um when I was at a half, two hours. Um when I was at Juniper I worked on the secure Juniper I worked on the secure Juniper I worked on the secure development life cycle and we used we development life cycle and we used we development life cycle and we used we leveraged the data in two different leveraged the data in two different leveraged the data in two different ways. First thing was key was to get ways. First thing was key was to get ways. First thing was key was to get fields added to the defect tracking fields added to the defect tracking fields added to the defect tracking system to track CVE labels, CDSS score system to track CVE labels, CDSS score system to track CVE labels, CDSS score and CWE levels. Um and that gave us some and CWE levels. Um and that gave us some and CWE levels. Um and that gave us some information to work from. when we had information to work from. when we had information to work from. when we had specific engagements either internal or specific engagements either internal or specific engagements either internal or contract pen test of a particular contract pen test of a particular contract pen test of a particular product for example um I use the CW product for example um I use the CW product for example um I use the CW labelled data to develop a 10,000 foot labelled data to develop a 10,000 foot labelled data to develop a 10,000 foot understanding because if you go into a understanding because if you go into a understanding because if you go into a mid-level or top level executive and mid-level or top level executive and mid-level or top level executive and talk about buffer overflow buffer talk about buffer overflow buffer talk about buffer overflow buffer underflow off by one era off by two underflow off by one era off by two underflow off by one era off by two error their eyes glaze over pretty error their eyes glaze over pretty error their eyes glaze over pretty quickly um and um so that wasn't useful quickly um and um so that wasn't useful quickly um and um so that wasn't useful when you can do the higher level stuff when you can do the higher level stuff when you can do the higher level stuff because you're looking at the CW labels because you're looking at the CW labels because you're looking at the CW labels that crop up. You can do things like that crop up. You can do things like that crop up. You can do things like recommend that is developers desperately recommend that is developers desperately recommend that is developers desperately need remedial web security training uh need remedial web security training uh need remedial web security training uh or or similar. Um the other thing you or or similar. Um the other thing you or or similar. Um the other thing you can do is you can champion efforts to can do is you can champion efforts to can do is you can champion efforts to switch over to Rust for example because switch over to Rust for example because switch over to Rust for example because you can take and wipe an entire category you can take and wipe an entire category you can take and wipe an entire category of weakness labels off the table if you of weakness labels off the table if you of weakness labels off the table if you can get support for that. Um, the other can get support for that. Um, the other can get support for that. Um, the other way that we use this is I began with the way that we use this is I began with the way that we use this is I began with the once we started accumulating enough once we started accumulating enough once we started accumulating enough data, I began doing an annual top 10 data, I began doing an annual top 10 data, I began doing an annual top 10 weakness report internal to the company. weakness report internal to the company. weakness report internal to the company. And that got a lot of attention. Um, and And that got a lot of attention. Um, and And that got a lot of attention. Um, and to do that, you don't have to be to do that, you don't have to be to do that, you don't have to be perfect. And also, if you do that, perfect. And also, if you do that, perfect. And also, if you do that, remember that my boss Seth Ross thought remember that my boss Seth Ross thought remember that my boss Seth Ross thought of this. I wish I'd thought of that. He of this. I wish I'd thought of that. He of this. I wish I'd thought of that. He pointed out people started bargaining pointed out people started bargaining pointed out people started bargaining about, you know, about, you know, about, you know, Is the item in position four really Is the item in position four really Is the item in position four really worse or or better than the item in worse or or better than the item in worse or or better than the item in position eight? It doesn't matter. What position eight? It doesn't matter. What position eight? It doesn't matter. What matters is that the weaknesses showed up matters is that the weaknesses showed up matters is that the weaknesses showed up in that list, the top 10 without regard in that list, the top 10 without regard in that list, the top 10 without regard to rank. Um, and last but not least, to rank. Um, and last but not least, to rank. Um, and last but not least, Juniper had a practice. I don't know if Juniper had a practice. I don't know if Juniper had a practice. I don't know if they're still doing it, but they had they're still doing it, but they had they're still doing it, but they had what they called the Big Bang Day. And what they called the Big Bang Day. And what they called the Big Bang Day. And it was once or twice a year engineers it was once or twice a year engineers it was once or twice a year engineers had the freedom to work on whatever they had the freedom to work on whatever they had the freedom to work on whatever they wanted to work on. And I exploited that wanted to work on. And I exploited that wanted to work on. And I exploited that to get our security champions to go fix to get our security champions to go fix to get our security champions to go fix that weakness that was over in this that weakness that was over in this that weakness that was over in this piece of code that everybody knew about piece of code that everybody knew about piece of code that everybody knew about for four years and nobody had the nerve for four years and nobody had the nerve for four years and nobody had the nerve to fix. Um because that's the other to fix. Um because that's the other to fix. Um because that's the other problem I ran into with working on CWES. problem I ran into with working on CWES. problem I ran into with working on CWES. Hypothetical manager developer Hypothetical manager developer Hypothetical manager developer conversation. How did your day go today? conversation. How did your day go today? conversation. How did your day go today? And the developer said great. I fixed And the developer said great. I fixed And the developer said great. I fixed these two weaknesses. And the manager these two weaknesses. And the manager these two weaknesses. And the manager says well that's great but what about says well that's great but what about says well that's great but what about our stuff that we have to get done under our stuff that we have to get done under our stuff that we have to get done under contract for this customer? Well, I contract for this customer? Well, I contract for this customer? Well, I didn't get any of that done, but I got didn't get any of that done, but I got didn't get any of that done, but I got these weaknesses fixed. You know, that's these weaknesses fixed. You know, that's these weaknesses fixed. You know, that's bad enough, but here's the kicker. The bad enough, but here's the kicker. The bad enough, but here's the kicker. The manager says, "Let me get this straight. manager says, "Let me get this straight. manager says, "Let me get this straight. The code was working before you screwed The code was working before you screwed The code was working before you screwed around with around with around with it." Well, yeah, but I think why did you it." Well, yeah, but I think why did you it." Well, yeah, but I think why did you mess with it? Right. That's the hidden mess with it? Right. That's the hidden mess with it? Right. That's the hidden trap for any of this work on CWES. It's trap for any of this work on CWES. It's trap for any of this work on CWES. It's a weakness, not a vulnerability. And a weakness, not a vulnerability. And a weakness, not a vulnerability. And it's an uphill battle to convince people it's an uphill battle to convince people it's an uphill battle to convince people that you need to fix them before they that you need to fix them before they that you need to fix them before they become a vulnerability. And that was one become a vulnerability. And that was one become a vulnerability. And that was one of the biggest problems that I that I of the biggest problems that I that I of the biggest problems that I that I had with it. Any I hope that helps. I'm had with it. Any I hope that helps. I'm had with it. Any I hope that helps. I'm I'm happy to share um that paper's I'm happy to share um that paper's I'm happy to share um that paper's archaic now. Koala Lumpur. I don't archaic now. Koala Lumpur. I don't archaic now. Koala Lumpur. I don't remember. Do you remember when we were remember. Do you remember when we were remember. Do you remember when we were in Koala in Koala in Koala Lumpur? 2018. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Oh, I remember. Well, I would be Yes. Oh, I remember. Well, I would be Yes. Oh, I remember. Well, I would be interest I would be interested in that interest I would be interested in that interest I would be interested in that paper. They thought I was law paper. They thought I was law paper. They thought I was law enforcement. I was riding the escalators enforcement. I was riding the escalators enforcement. I was riding the escalators in the conference room and the and the in the conference room and the and the in the conference room and the and the militia would come to attention and militia would come to attention and militia would come to attention and salute me as I went by and I was like salute me as I went by and I was like salute me as I went by and I was like this is weird. You you said a couple of this is weird. You you said a couple of this is weird. You you said a couple of things there and I have a follow-up things there and I have a follow-up things there and I have a follow-up question for you but you said a couple question for you but you said a couple question for you but you said a couple of things that I I liked the training of things that I I liked the training of things that I I liked the training bit. I had actually thought about the bit. I had actually thought about the bit. I had actually thought about the training bit like some of it is just you training bit like some of it is just you training bit like some of it is just you know you may not have to make a change know you may not have to make a change know you may not have to make a change in the coding level but may or maybe you in the coding level but may or maybe you in the coding level but may or maybe you do but maybe it's influenced by the by do but maybe it's influenced by the by do but maybe it's influenced by the by the training right and yeah no we we the training right and yeah no we we the training right and yeah no we we started uh I I had forgotten this but started uh I I had forgotten this but started uh I I had forgotten this but you're reminding me now um we were uh you're reminding me now um we were uh you're reminding me now um we were uh there was mandatory uh secure coding there was mandatory uh secure coding there was mandatory uh secure coding training internally um and you were training internally um and you were training internally um and you were required to pass the training for one required to pass the training for one required to pass the training for one area that was most aligned to the type area that was most aligned to the type area that was most aligned to the type of work you're doing so if you're coding of work you're doing so if you're coding of work you're doing so if you're coding in C for example you did the C version in C for example you did the C version in C for example you did the C version if you're working in JavaScript if you're working in JavaScript if you're working in JavaScript character, whatever. There were there character, whatever. There were there character, whatever. There were there were other versions. Um, and then we were other versions. Um, and then we were other versions. Um, and then we flagged that in the internal records and flagged that in the internal records and flagged that in the internal records and we did um, uh, we did some security we did um, uh, we did some security we did um, uh, we did some security champions that went the other direction champions that went the other direction champions that went the other direction if they did really well on their exams if they did really well on their exams if they did really well on their exams and stuff. One more followup question and stuff. One more followup question and stuff. One more followup question for you and I know we have a question for you and I know we have a question for you and I know we have a question over here. Um, with your report that you over here. Um, with your report that you over here. Um, with your report that you released, did you structure that based released, did you structure that based released, did you structure that based off of like the entire portfolio or did off of like the entire portfolio or did off of like the entire portfolio or did you zero in on specific products? you zero in on specific products? you zero in on specific products? Um, the report you're talking about the Um, the report you're talking about the Um, the report you're talking about the annual top 10, correct? Uh it was mostly annual top 10, correct? Uh it was mostly annual top 10, correct? Uh it was mostly uh Junos. Um but there were exceptions uh Junos. Um but there were exceptions uh Junos. Um but there were exceptions if there were if there were other if there were if there were other if there were if there were other schemes where stuff popped up a lot. schemes where stuff popped up a lot. schemes where stuff popped up a lot. Yes. But the vast majority of this stuff Yes. But the vast majority of this stuff Yes. But the vast majority of this stuff were were uh problem reports filed were were uh problem reports filed were were uh problem reports filed against Junos's code. So that was where against Junos's code. So that was where against Junos's code. So that was where most of the report you know because that most of the report you know because that most of the report you know because that was where the data was. The one downside was where the data was. The one downside was where the data was. The one downside of this I will point out, we only had of this I will point out, we only had of this I will point out, we only had weakness labels weakness labels weakness labels for onetenth maybe only one 100th of a for onetenth maybe only one 100th of a for onetenth maybe only one 100th of a percent of the actual number of defect percent of the actual number of defect percent of the actual number of defect reports that were filed because a lot of reports that were filed because a lot of reports that were filed because a lot of those were automated um and just you those were automated um and just you those were automated um and just you know routine stuff. So it wasn't a know routine stuff. So it wasn't a know routine stuff. So it wasn't a perfect snapshot. It was a snapshot of perfect snapshot. It was a snapshot of perfect snapshot. It was a snapshot of stuff that was undercovered either stuff that was undercovered either stuff that was undercovered either through reporting or or external through reporting or or external through reporting or or external reporting or testing that identified as reporting or testing that identified as reporting or testing that identified as a vulnerability. We didn't bother with a vulnerability. We didn't bother with a vulnerability. We didn't bother with general code. Awesome. Um, okay. So, general code. Awesome. Um, okay. So, general code. Awesome. Um, okay. So, while the while the microphone gets while the while the microphone gets while the while the microphone gets passed, uh, and this may be something passed, uh, and this may be something passed, uh, and this may be something that's a better fit for the scope that's a better fit for the scope that's a better fit for the scope tomorrow for for what Rogue is going to tomorrow for for what Rogue is going to tomorrow for for what Rogue is going to talk through, but, um, I I you know, I talk through, but, um, I I you know, I talk through, but, um, I I you know, I think our some of our developing teams, think our some of our developing teams, think our some of our developing teams, developers are under a lot of stress developers are under a lot of stress developers are under a lot of stress right now and and you know, with with right now and and you know, with with right now and and you know, with with the vulnerabilities and most of them the vulnerabilities and most of them the vulnerabilities and most of them would actually like to implement would actually like to implement would actually like to implement features or fix bugs. Um, and so, um, features or fix bugs. Um, and so, um, features or fix bugs. Um, and so, um, you know, it's not that hard of a cell you know, it's not that hard of a cell you know, it's not that hard of a cell anymore. I mean, the hardest part is anymore. I mean, the hardest part is anymore. I mean, the hardest part is doing the work to collect some of this doing the work to collect some of this doing the work to collect some of this data so that you can present it in front data so that you can present it in front data so that you can present it in front of them and say, "Look, you could solve, of them and say, "Look, you could solve, of them and say, "Look, you could solve, you know, you could freeze up some of you know, you could freeze up some of you know, you could freeze up some of your bandwidth if you just, you know, your bandwidth if you just, you know, your bandwidth if you just, you know, fix this a certain way, right?" Like, fix this a certain way, right?" Like, fix this a certain way, right?" Like, but you have to have the data structured but you have to have the data structured but you have to have the data structured and you have to be able to sell that to and you have to be able to sell that to and you have to be able to sell that to them. And that does take a little bit of them. And that does take a little bit of them. And that does take a little bit of work. Again, that's why I say maybe it work. Again, that's why I say maybe it work. Again, that's why I say maybe it fits in with more what Rogue is going to fits in with more what Rogue is going to fits in with more what Rogue is going to talk about tomorrow. Um, question over talk about tomorrow. Um, question over talk about tomorrow. Um, question over here. here. here. Um, thank you for your comment because Um, thank you for your comment because Um, thank you for your comment because it actually um it's part of what my it actually um it's part of what my it actually um it's part of what my question is about leveraging the CW question is about leveraging the CW question is about leveraging the CW data. Um, what the people that I'm working for Um, what the people that I'm working for Um, what the people that I'm working for are are saying to me is, I don't want are are saying to me is, I don't want are are saying to me is, I don't want you reporting any more you reporting any more you reporting any more stuff. Um, because I got the report from stuff. Um, because I got the report from stuff. Um, because I got the report from here about the C.We and here for the CWA here about the C.We and here for the CWA here about the C.We and here for the CWA and blah blah blah. But what I need to and blah blah blah. But what I need to and blah blah blah. But what I need to do is provide recommendations based off do is provide recommendations based off do is provide recommendations based off of that C.WE data. So I want to be able of that C.WE data. So I want to be able of that C.WE data. So I want to be able to leverage it that way. So I'm not just to leverage it that way. So I'm not just to leverage it that way. So I'm not just saying here's the these, you know, saying here's the these, you know, saying here's the these, you know, weaknesses. Um, so I want to be able to weaknesses. Um, so I want to be able to weaknesses. Um, so I want to be able to leverage it in more of a predictive way. leverage it in more of a predictive way. leverage it in more of a predictive way. I think is that something that's I don't I think is that something that's I don't I think is that something that's I don't even know if that's possible. Is that even know if that's possible. Is that even know if that's possible. Is that possible? I think it's possible. And I possible? I think it's possible. And I possible? I think it's possible. And I think we're going to talk a little bit think we're going to talk a little bit think we're going to talk a little bit about it tomorrow. Excellent. Make sure about it tomorrow. Excellent. Make sure about it tomorrow. Excellent. Make sure you come to that session. Thank you. Any you come to that session. Thank you. Any you come to that session. Thank you. Any other questions?
