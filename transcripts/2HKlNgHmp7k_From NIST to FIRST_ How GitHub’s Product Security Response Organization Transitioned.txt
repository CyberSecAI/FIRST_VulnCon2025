Kind: captions Language: en Thanks so much for that everyone. Uh I Thanks so much for that everyone. Uh I Thanks so much for that everyone. Uh I today we're going to talk about uh today we're going to talk about uh today we're going to talk about uh GitHub's journey from this to and how we GitHub's journey from this to and how we GitHub's journey from this to and how we benchmark our program uh and a little benchmark our program uh and a little benchmark our program uh and a little bit about how we split from one into a bit about how we split from one into a bit about how we split from one into a C3. Uh it's a short talk so we're C3. Uh it's a short talk so we're C3. Uh it's a short talk so we're keeping it very high level. We're going keeping it very high level. We're going keeping it very high level. We're going to be looking at three different to be looking at three different to be looking at three different frameworks and third program. Uh so look frameworks and third program. Uh so look frameworks and third program. Uh so look more of an invitation if anything pees more of an invitation if anything pees more of an invitation if anything pees your curiosity to come find us your curiosity to come find us your curiosity to come find us throughout the conference and dig in uh throughout the conference and dig in uh throughout the conference and dig in uh to learn more. So definitely welcome to learn more. So definitely welcome to learn more. So definitely welcome conversation and questions and we'll conversation and questions and we'll conversation and questions and we'll follow follow follow up. Uh so I am Sarah Clemens. Uh I am up. Uh so I am Sarah Clemens. Uh I am up. Uh so I am Sarah Clemens. Uh I am the peer manager for our bug bounty and the peer manager for our bug bounty and the peer manager for our bug bounty and research teams at GitHub. Um, and my research teams at GitHub. Um, and my research teams at GitHub. Um, and my favorite thing about what I do is using favorite thing about what I do is using favorite thing about what I do is using values alignment frameworks to make values alignment frameworks to make values alignment frameworks to make high-risisk decisions. Uh, and my high-risisk decisions. Uh, and my high-risisk decisions. Uh, and my coaching here is Jeff. coaching here is Jeff. coaching here is Jeff. Hey everybody, my name is Jeff. Um, I Hey everybody, my name is Jeff. Um, I Hey everybody, my name is Jeff. Um, I work in the bone management program now. work in the bone management program now. work in the bone management program now. I used to work on the bug bounty program I used to work on the bug bounty program I used to work on the bug bounty program and team and and moved over just a few and team and and moved over just a few and team and and moved over just a few weeks ago. Um, my favorite thing is to weeks ago. Um, my favorite thing is to weeks ago. Um, my favorite thing is to tackle bugs and bones at scale and we're tackle bugs and bones at scale and we're tackle bugs and bones at scale and we're definitely going to talk about that definitely going to talk about that definitely going to talk about that today. So to give a quick look at what we'll be So to give a quick look at what we'll be So to give a quick look at what we'll be talking about today, uh we're first talking about today, uh we're first talking about today, uh we're first going to look at the program goals that going to look at the program goals that going to look at the program goals that we founded our fert on uh as well as a we founded our fert on uh as well as a we founded our fert on uh as well as a mini history of pets at GitHub via the mini history of pets at GitHub via the mini history of pets at GitHub via the lens of these three different frameworks lens of these three different frameworks lens of these three different frameworks and then uh we'll end with a highle and then uh we'll end with a highle and then uh we'll end with a highle sample mapping of our current program sample mapping of our current program sample mapping of our current program and kind of how we've aligned it to the and kind of how we've aligned it to the and kind of how we've aligned it to the third research services framework. So looking at PERS programs these are So looking at PERS programs these are So looking at PERS programs these are the top level sort of pillars that we the top level sort of pillars that we the top level sort of pillars that we are uh that we use to grow and mature are uh that we use to grow and mature are uh that we use to grow and mature the program. So we have maturity the program. So we have maturity the program. So we have maturity scalability and sustainability. Maturity scalability and sustainability. Maturity scalability and sustainability. Maturity is going to be a large part of this is going to be a large part of this is going to be a large part of this focus since we're looking at these focus since we're looking at these focus since we're looking at these frameworks and the goal was to mature frameworks and the goal was to mature frameworks and the goal was to mature our program. Uh the important thing our program. Uh the important thing our program. Uh the important thing about having these three this lens with about having these three this lens with about having these three this lens with these three pillars is to ensure that these three pillars is to ensure that these three pillars is to ensure that any maturity we do is also scalable and any maturity we do is also scalable and any maturity we do is also scalable and sustainable and by scalable I mean we sustainable and by scalable I mean we sustainable and by scalable I mean we expect ideally GitHub to grow. Uh and so expect ideally GitHub to grow. Uh and so expect ideally GitHub to grow. Uh and so we need to make sure that our program we need to make sure that our program we need to make sure that our program doesn't just keep up but also sees doesn't just keep up but also sees doesn't just keep up but also sees ahead. uh sustainability. Probably ahead. uh sustainability. Probably ahead. uh sustainability. Probably everyone in this room knows that IR everyone in this room knows that IR everyone in this room knows that IR instant response not with a faint heart. instant response not with a faint heart. instant response not with a faint heart. Uh resiliency is incredibly important. Uh resiliency is incredibly important. Uh resiliency is incredibly important. And so every maturity benchmark we hit, And so every maturity benchmark we hit, And so every maturity benchmark we hit, every step we move forward, we need to every step we move forward, we need to every step we move forward, we need to make sure that it is sustainable for the make sure that it is sustainable for the make sure that it is sustainable for the people who are actually operating the people who are actually operating the people who are actually operating the program. So just to give you a view of our So just to give you a view of our So just to give you a view of our program again it's a uh at GitHub we're program again it's a uh at GitHub we're program again it's a uh at GitHub we're following the distributed model uh we following the distributed model uh we following the distributed model uh we have a small core team of P30s with a have a small core team of P30s with a have a small core team of P30s with a wide ranging network of stakeholders. So wide ranging network of stakeholders. So wide ranging network of stakeholders. So our PER team is largely a coordination our PER team is largely a coordination our PER team is largely a coordination function where we delegate uh as well as function where we delegate uh as well as function where we delegate uh as well as uh an analytical function and uh we have uh an analytical function and uh we have uh an analytical function and uh we have stakeholders across the company that can stakeholders across the company that can stakeholders across the company that can manage different aspects of our manage different aspects of our manage different aspects of our vulnerability management. So now I'm going to go back management. So now I'm going to go back management. So now I'm going to go back in time before there was a psert uh in time before there was a psert uh in time before there was a psert uh there was just one at GitHub. Uh so they there was just one at GitHub. Uh so they there was just one at GitHub. Uh so they handled both corporate incident response handled both corporate incident response handled both corporate incident response as well as product incident response. Uh as well as product incident response. Uh as well as product incident response. Uh the IR uh program that original search the IR uh program that original search the IR uh program that original search was originally founded on the controls was originally founded on the controls was originally founded on the controls set by set by set by NIST. So taking a look at these controls NIST. So taking a look at these controls NIST. So taking a look at these controls a very simplified version of NIST a very simplified version of NIST a very simplified version of NIST 800-61. Uh this is 800-61. Uh this is 800-61. Uh this is um so this is where we started from. We um so this is where we started from. We um so this is where we started from. We had the process and the plan which was had the process and the plan which was had the process and the plan which was our incident response plan. Uh this is our incident response plan. Uh this is our incident response plan. Uh this is not like a playbook but it's what our not like a playbook but it's what our not like a playbook but it's what our all of our playbooks are based off of. all of our playbooks are based off of. all of our playbooks are based off of. If you're on my team might not even If you're on my team might not even If you're on my team might not even remember where the plan is because it is remember where the plan is because it is remember where the plan is because it is just so unique to the way that you work just so unique to the way that you work just so unique to the way that you work that it's just ingrained in how we work. that it's just ingrained in how we work. that it's just ingrained in how we work. Uh but we do have it written out. Um so Uh but we do have it written out. Um so Uh but we do have it written out. Um so this is like the most critical part of this is like the most critical part of this is like the most critical part of the really like foundational part of an the really like foundational part of an the really like foundational part of an IR a piece or IR program. IR a piece or IR program. IR a piece or IR program. Uh communication covers a really really Uh communication covers a really really Uh communication covers a really really broad set of stakeholders for us. That's broad set of stakeholders for us. That's broad set of stakeholders for us. That's internal external engineers product internal external engineers product internal external engineers product owners legal users um law enforcement owners legal users um law enforcement owners legal users um law enforcement various international governing uh various international governing uh various international governing uh bodies. So knowing who they are and how bodies. So knowing who they are and how bodies. So knowing who they are and how to find them all is a challenge. Uh we to find them all is a challenge. Uh we to find them all is a challenge. Uh we keep an internal stakeholder rolodex at keep an internal stakeholder rolodex at keep an internal stakeholder rolodex at GitHub. Uh that helps us uh keep up to GitHub. Uh that helps us uh keep up to GitHub. Uh that helps us uh keep up to date with our contacts. Uh we also have date with our contacts. Uh we also have date with our contacts. Uh we also have a service catalog which helps find a service catalog which helps find a service catalog which helps find product owners for different product product owners for different product product owners for different product areas at GitHub. Uh, so that can be areas at GitHub. Uh, so that can be areas at GitHub. Uh, so that can be really helpful in the heat of a really helpful in the heat of a really helpful in the heat of a vulnerability and response to be able to vulnerability and response to be able to vulnerability and response to be able to just run over to your directory and find just run over to your directory and find just run over to your directory and find the people you need to find. the people you need to find. the people you need to find. Uh, scope is probably the simplest to Uh, scope is probably the simplest to Uh, scope is probably the simplest to explain, but the hardest to actually explain, but the hardest to actually explain, but the hardest to actually like build for your organization. Uh, or like build for your organization. Uh, or like build for your organization. Uh, or it certainly was for us. it certainly was for us. it certainly was for us. Um, at its core, scope is what we cover Um, at its core, scope is what we cover Um, at its core, scope is what we cover and when we cover it. Uh but mapping it and when we cover it. Uh but mapping it and when we cover it. Uh but mapping it out can actually prove to be a lot more out can actually prove to be a lot more out can actually prove to be a lot more challenging than it sounds because it challenging than it sounds because it challenging than it sounds because it can be a moving target with a growing can be a moving target with a growing can be a moving target with a growing company. Um it's a moving target because company. Um it's a moving target because company. Um it's a moving target because security is always moving and uh security is always moving and uh security is always moving and uh resources change. Um and that can also resources change. Um and that can also resources change. Um and that can also bring about challenges in how you scope bring about challenges in how you scope bring about challenges in how you scope your your your program. And lastly, staffing, program. And lastly, staffing, program. And lastly, staffing, establishing dedicated and trained establishing dedicated and trained establishing dedicated and trained responders. Um this is we're going to responders. Um this is we're going to responders. Um this is we're going to talk a little bit more about that as talk a little bit more about that as talk a little bit more about that as well. uh but basically we have the core well. uh but basically we have the core well. uh but basically we have the core IR teams and their responsibilities and IR teams and their responsibilities and IR teams and their responsibilities and uh uh uh training. So peeking ahead a little bit training. So peeking ahead a little bit training. So peeking ahead a little bit at the first PERT services framework uh at the first PERT services framework uh at the first PERT services framework uh a lot of our NIST derived program a lot of our NIST derived program a lot of our NIST derived program fundamentals are straight one to one fundamentals are straight one to one fundamentals are straight one to one mapping for the organizational mapping for the organizational mapping for the organizational foundations of the PERT services foundations of the PERT services foundations of the PERT services framework. Uh what this means is that we framework. Uh what this means is that we framework. Uh what this means is that we started with a really strong foundation started with a really strong foundation started with a really strong foundation to build off of. That foundation is to build off of. That foundation is to build off of. That foundation is incredibly incredibly incredibly important. These fundamentals are going important. These fundamentals are going important. These fundamentals are going to set the tone and the culture of your to set the tone and the culture of your to set the tone and the culture of your IR program. Um they are also a great and IR program. Um they are also a great and IR program. Um they are also a great and necessary opportunity to get leadership necessary opportunity to get leadership necessary opportunity to get leadership buyin, which is critical during a time buyin, which is critical during a time buyin, which is critical during a time of crisis so that they understand of crisis so that they understand of crisis so that they understand exactly how things are going to go down. So as GitHub grew and So as GitHub grew and So as GitHub grew and expanded going back to the history of expanded going back to the history of expanded going back to the history of GitHub's PERT, uh we realized it made a GitHub's PERT, uh we realized it made a GitHub's PERT, uh we realized it made a lot of sense to split the out into C lot of sense to split the out into C lot of sense to split the out into C into a CERT corporate function and a into a CERT corporate function and a into a CERT corporate function and a PERT product function. Primary reason it PERT product function. Primary reason it PERT product function. Primary reason it came down to was prioritization. it came down to was prioritization. it came down to was prioritization. it became exceptionally difficult to became exceptionally difficult to became exceptionally difficult to consider prioritizing resources for consider prioritizing resources for consider prioritizing resources for corporate and product and to not end up corporate and product and to not end up corporate and product and to not end up in a place in the worst of times where in a place in the worst of times where in a place in the worst of times where it almost feels like a conflict of it almost feels like a conflict of it almost feels like a conflict of interest. So as a new keer we wanted to interest. So as a new keer we wanted to interest. So as a new keer we wanted to dive in deeper. dive in deeper. dive in deeper. uh we wanted to learn more and build off uh we wanted to learn more and build off uh we wanted to learn more and build off of what we had started with uh which is of what we had started with uh which is of what we had started with uh which is when we turned to the forum for incident when we turned to the forum for incident when we turned to the forum for incident response and security response and security response and security teams. Uh members here already know in teams. Uh members here already know in teams. Uh members here already know in case you haven't applied yet though uh case you haven't applied yet though uh case you haven't applied yet though uh there is a baseline of maturity that is there is a baseline of maturity that is there is a baseline of maturity that is required to get into cls as a member. We required to get into cls as a member. We required to get into cls as a member. We had a little bit of work to do before we had a little bit of work to do before we had a little bit of work to do before we meet that baseline. uh and that baseline meet that baseline. uh and that baseline meet that baseline. uh and that baseline is defined by the SIM 3 is defined by the SIM 3 is defined by the SIM 3 framework. So the SIM 3 security framework. So the SIM 3 security framework. So the SIM 3 security incident management maturity model incident management maturity model incident management maturity model because I love spelling out my acronyms because I love spelling out my acronyms because I love spelling out my acronyms uh is um a 0 to4 scale to assess the uh is um a 0 to4 scale to assess the uh is um a 0 to4 scale to assess the level of maturity of an IR program. Now level of maturity of an IR program. Now level of maturity of an IR program. Now this framework is actually geared a lot this framework is actually geared a lot this framework is actually geared a lot more towards a CESERT a corporate more towards a CESERT a corporate more towards a CESERT a corporate incident response. Um, so it overlaps it incident response. Um, so it overlaps it incident response. Um, so it overlaps it over overlapped a lot for where we were over overlapped a lot for where we were over overlapped a lot for where we were at the time that we split off. Uh, but at the time that we split off. Uh, but at the time that we split off. Uh, but we did still have some improvements to we did still have some improvements to we did still have some improvements to make. So using an example, I have my make. So using an example, I have my make. So using an example, I have my shorthand version of the 0ero to4 scale. shorthand version of the 0ero to4 scale. shorthand version of the 0ero to4 scale. Apologies if anybody who worked on sim 3 Apologies if anybody who worked on sim 3 Apologies if anybody who worked on sim 3 is is is here. Uh, the staffing using the going here. Uh, the staffing using the going here. Uh, the staffing using the going back to the staffing from the NIST core back to the staffing from the NIST core back to the staffing from the NIST core foundation looking at the scale. Uh the foundation looking at the scale. Uh the foundation looking at the scale. Uh the way we kind of like worked through it is way we kind of like worked through it is way we kind of like worked through it is zero you don't have an IR one we have a zero you don't have an IR one we have a zero you don't have an IR one we have a dedicate we have dedicated IR IC's uh dedicate we have dedicated IR IC's uh dedicate we have dedicated IR IC's uh step two we have a minimum dedicated step two we have a minimum dedicated step two we have a minimum dedicated number of IC's documented in our uh number of IC's documented in our uh number of IC's documented in our uh policies and standards uh three we have policies and standards uh three we have policies and standards uh three we have a minimum number of dedicated IC's um a minimum number of dedicated IC's um a minimum number of dedicated IC's um documented and that document is approved documented and that document is approved documented and that document is approved and upheld by our leadership team and and upheld by our leadership team and and upheld by our leadership team and four we reassign less capacity and four we reassign less capacity and four we reassign less capacity and staffing needs yearly and update that staffing needs yearly and update that staffing needs yearly and update that accordingly with an approval chain. So that's just kind of a quick chain. So that's just kind of a quick chain. So that's just kind of a quick look at how we uh approached the SI3 look at how we uh approached the SI3 look at how we uh approached the SI3 framework in order to reach that framework in order to reach that framework in order to reach that baseline baseline baseline maturity and this was the great tool maturity and this was the great tool maturity and this was the great tool that they had to check against it. Uh it that they had to check against it. Uh it that they had to check against it. Uh it took us about a year of pushing forward took us about a year of pushing forward took us about a year of pushing forward between crises uh in order to achieve between crises uh in order to achieve between crises uh in order to achieve the baseline where we felt confident the baseline where we felt confident the baseline where we felt confident submitting our application. And um that submitting our application. And um that submitting our application. And um that was thanks to persistence, the wide was thanks to persistence, the wide was thanks to persistence, the wide reaching coordination skills and the reaching coordination skills and the reaching coordination skills and the furious docs writing capability that you furious docs writing capability that you furious docs writing capability that you would expect from an incident response would expect from an incident response would expect from an incident response team. Uh so big shout out to BERT who team. Uh so big shout out to BERT who team. Uh so big shout out to BERT who are um much of the green on this chart are um much of the green on this chart are um much of the green on this chart is a direct result of their work. is a direct result of their work. is a direct result of their work. Um so you can see this chart is broken Um so you can see this chart is broken Um so you can see this chart is broken out into four different sections. Uh out into four different sections. Uh out into four different sections. Uh operational organization which is that operational organization which is that operational organization which is that operational foundations kind of coming operational foundations kind of coming operational foundations kind of coming back to those foundational principles. back to those foundational principles. back to those foundational principles. Um the human aspect resiliency training Um the human aspect resiliency training Um the human aspect resiliency training uh tools this part was a little more sea uh tools this part was a little more sea uh tools this part was a little more sea focused. Um I did not fill out this focused. Um I did not fill out this focused. Um I did not fill out this portion of the chart so don't think that portion of the chart so don't think that portion of the chart so don't think that we're at a level one here. we're at a level one here. we're at a level one here. Um so processes is the final the fourth Um so processes is the final the fourth Um so processes is the final the fourth group and that's the sequence of actions group and that's the sequence of actions group and that's the sequence of actions and tools to achieve the desired result and tools to achieve the desired result and tools to achieve the desired result of the program. Um so that that is of the program. Um so that that is of the program. Um so that that is all living and moving part of our maturity. Okay. So we founded an IR maturity. Okay. So we founded an IR maturity. Okay. So we founded an IR program with NIST. We secured this elite program with NIST. We secured this elite program with NIST. We secured this elite membership with first uh via the sim membership with first uh via the sim membership with first uh via the sim free cesert benchmark. So now what about free cesert benchmark. So now what about free cesert benchmark. So now what about maturing a product security incident maturing a product security incident maturing a product security incident response team and this is where first response team and this is where first response team and this is where first really comes in uh because they have an really comes in uh because they have an really comes in uh because they have an established product security IR specific framework and we're going to take a look framework and we're going to take a look framework and we're going to take a look at that framework right here. at that framework right here. at that framework right here. Uh the framework is laid out here. It Uh the framework is laid out here. It Uh the framework is laid out here. It includes that organizational foundations includes that organizational foundations includes that organizational foundations at the top which again aligns very at the top which again aligns very at the top which again aligns very closely to the work we have done with uh closely to the work we have done with uh closely to the work we have done with uh the NIST the NIST the NIST alignment. Down the center you have the alignment. Down the center you have the alignment. Down the center you have the vulnerability life cycle in an incident. vulnerability life cycle in an incident. vulnerability life cycle in an incident. Uh and you can see each of which has a Uh and you can see each of which has a Uh and you can see each of which has a connection to the stakeholder ecosystem connection to the stakeholder ecosystem connection to the stakeholder ecosystem management and the training and management and the training and management and the training and education. This framework helped us education. This framework helped us education. This framework helped us align really tightly with our bug bounty align really tightly with our bug bounty align really tightly with our bug bounty program. Um, as we divided out from this program. Um, as we divided out from this program. Um, as we divided out from this uh from Caesar, we started to align more uh from Caesar, we started to align more uh from Caesar, we started to align more closely with Bug Bounty. This enables closely with Bug Bounty. This enables closely with Bug Bounty. This enables our teams to build a more more holistic our teams to build a more more holistic our teams to build a more more holistic firstparty vulnerability management firstparty vulnerability management firstparty vulnerability management program that is working in tight program that is working in tight program that is working in tight partnership with our entire engineering board. Um, so from here I'm going to board. Um, so from here I'm going to board. Um, so from here I'm going to pass it over to Jeff who's going to take pass it over to Jeff who's going to take pass it over to Jeff who's going to take a look at this framework. We're going to a look at this framework. We're going to a look at this framework. We're going to walk through the uh vulnerability life walk through the uh vulnerability life walk through the uh vulnerability life cycle here and talk a little bit again cycle here and talk a little bit again cycle here and talk a little bit again very high level about how we approach very high level about how we approach very high level about how we approach foundations, stakeholder ecosystem and foundations, stakeholder ecosystem and foundations, stakeholder ecosystem and training and education for um each of training and education for um each of training and education for um each of these service areas two through five. Uh these service areas two through five. Uh these service areas two through five. Uh so Jeff, take it away. so Jeff, take it away. so Jeff, take it away. All right. Um thanks Sarah. So our book All right. Um thanks Sarah. So our book All right. Um thanks Sarah. So our book bounting program is very unique here at bounting program is very unique here at bounting program is very unique here at GitHub. Um it's a fundamental part of GitHub. Um it's a fundamental part of GitHub. Um it's a fundamental part of our vulnerability life cycle. Our our vulnerability life cycle. Our our vulnerability life cycle. Our investments have really paid off. We uh investments have really paid off. We uh investments have really paid off. We uh invested heavy five years ago, created a invested heavy five years ago, created a invested heavy five years ago, created a bounty team, we created, you know, uh bounty team, we created, you know, uh bounty team, we created, you know, uh revamped our rewards. We have really revamped our rewards. We have really revamped our rewards. We have really high awards and just really gify uh high awards and just really gify uh high awards and just really gify uh security research. Um and so even today security research. Um and so even today security research. Um and so even today now we have a very mature and like now we have a very mature and like now we have a very mature and like dedicated team working on the book dedicated team working on the book dedicated team working on the book bounty program for product experts and bounty program for product experts and bounty program for product experts and engage with engineering, IR and and many engage with engineering, IR and and many engage with engineering, IR and and many more. more. more. Now let's let's go to phase one. So Now let's let's go to phase one. So Now let's let's go to phase one. So vulnerability discovery right is um the vulnerability discovery right is um the vulnerability discovery right is um the framework we're mapping to the service framework we're mapping to the service framework we're mapping to the service area framework that we talked about in area framework that we talked about in area framework that we talked about in the previous slide right this is the the previous slide right this is the the previous slide right this is the first phase of vulnerability life first phase of vulnerability life first phase of vulnerability life cycles. Um essentially we want our cycles. Um essentially we want our cycles. Um essentially we want our stakeholders to have proper ways of stakeholders to have proper ways of stakeholders to have proper ways of reporting their bugs and their bones to reporting their bugs and their bones to reporting their bugs and their bones to us. We also want internal folks to know us. We also want internal folks to know us. We also want internal folks to know where to communicate with us on Slack or where to communicate with us on Slack or where to communicate with us on Slack or whatever medium right we want to use. whatever medium right we want to use. whatever medium right we want to use. Um, we want external folks to have ways Um, we want external folks to have ways Um, we want external folks to have ways to submit security concerns and maybe to submit security concerns and maybe to submit security concerns and maybe they're not sure, should I submit this they're not sure, should I submit this they're not sure, should I submit this to bounty program? Is this just like a to bounty program? Is this just like a to bounty program? Is this just like a personal setup problem? We want to have personal setup problem? We want to have personal setup problem? We want to have that set up. And so we have Zenesk, we that set up. And so we have Zenesk, we that set up. And so we have Zenesk, we have email set up and we have those have email set up and we have those have email set up and we have those processes in place and they're processes in place and they're processes in place and they're consistent and they're repeatable and consistent and they're repeatable and consistent and they're repeatable and durable, which is the goal, right? Um durable, which is the goal, right? Um durable, which is the goal, right? Um and lastly we have security researchers and lastly we have security researchers and lastly we have security researchers right who can submit security issues via right who can submit security issues via right who can submit security issues via our public and our private programs on our public and our private programs on our public and our private programs on hyper one. Um and you know when we talk hyper one. Um and you know when we talk hyper one. Um and you know when we talk about training and education, we ensure about training and education, we ensure about training and education, we ensure that our discovery stakeholders know how that our discovery stakeholders know how that our discovery stakeholders know how to find and use the intake portals, to find and use the intake portals, to find and use the intake portals, right? Because if they can't use it and right? Because if they can't use it and right? Because if they can't use it and they can't submit things to us properly, they can't submit things to us properly, they can't submit things to us properly, then we're not going to get them on then we're not going to get them on then we're not going to get them on time. And time. And time. And so part of the sin 3 maturity effort was so part of the sin 3 maturity effort was so part of the sin 3 maturity effort was uh RFC 2350 and also for book bounty, uh RFC 2350 and also for book bounty, uh RFC 2350 and also for book bounty, right? like how do we continuously train right? like how do we continuously train right? like how do we continuously train and and educate ourselves internally and and and educate ourselves internally and and and educate ourselves internally and externally um on the world that is bound externally um on the world that is bound externally um on the world that is bound and and the way we approached that was and and the way we approached that was and and the way we approached that was we would do things that were you know we would do things that were you know we would do things that were you know public facing like uh bug bounty public facing like uh bug bounty public facing like uh bug bounty spotlight interviews you know we would spotlight interviews you know we would spotlight interviews you know we would interview some of our researchers and interview some of our researchers and interview some of our researchers and give them a voice like why do you hack give them a voice like why do you hack give them a voice like why do you hack on our program why why do you like to on our program why why do you like to on our program why why do you like to engage with with us you know um is it engage with with us you know um is it engage with with us you know um is it the money is it the facetime with the the money is it the facetime with the the money is it the facetime with the with the GitHub engineers directly like with the GitHub engineers directly like with the GitHub engineers directly like what is it that you know that that you what is it that you know that that you what is it that you know that that you like and we build off of that. Um public like and we build off of that. Um public like and we build off of that. Um public facing presence, right? We try to go to facing presence, right? We try to go to facing presence, right? We try to go to conferences, we try to meet our conferences, we try to meet our conferences, we try to meet our researchers, take them out for lunch, researchers, take them out for lunch, researchers, take them out for lunch, you know, just kind of get to know them you know, just kind of get to know them you know, just kind of get to know them and and keep them. Um but also gamifying and and keep them. Um but also gamifying and and keep them. Um but also gamifying bug hunting. We rolled out a swag shop bug hunting. We rolled out a swag shop bug hunting. We rolled out a swag shop that you would only get a swag coupon if that you would only get a swag coupon if that you would only get a swag coupon if you submitted a valid vulnerability, you you submitted a valid vulnerability, you you submitted a valid vulnerability, you know, and all of a sudden everyone was know, and all of a sudden everyone was know, and all of a sudden everyone was like, I want swag and I can only get it like, I want swag and I can only get it like, I want swag and I can only get it if I find a valid vulnerability. That's if I find a valid vulnerability. That's if I find a valid vulnerability. That's like a CTF in itself, you know, and I like a CTF in itself, you know, and I like a CTF in itself, you know, and I get money and some swag that only I can get money and some swag that only I can get money and some swag that only I can get. So that along with like public get. So that along with like public get. So that along with like public disclosures and crediting the disclosures and crediting the disclosures and crediting the researchers, those are ways that we researchers, those are ways that we researchers, those are ways that we would kind of approach the training and would kind of approach the training and would kind of approach the training and education for for education for for education for for discovery. So now we move to second discovery. So now we move to second discovery. So now we move to second phase, right? The second phase of the phase, right? The second phase of the phase, right? The second phase of the bone life cycle. Um the fundamental bone life cycle. Um the fundamental bone life cycle. Um the fundamental components of the triage process are we components of the triage process are we components of the triage process are we have our buck bounty engineers who have our buck bounty engineers who have our buck bounty engineers who assist in tracking the bones via our assist in tracking the bones via our assist in tracking the bones via our automation. um which kicks off our SLA automation. um which kicks off our SLA automation. um which kicks off our SLA for remediation, right? Hey, we've for remediation, right? Hey, we've for remediation, right? Hey, we've confirmed it's a bone. We here's all of confirmed it's a bone. We here's all of confirmed it's a bone. We here's all of our information, right? Our engineers our information, right? Our engineers our information, right? Our engineers are are, you know, they kind of write up are are, you know, they kind of write up are are, you know, they kind of write up a nice summary. They give all the a nice summary. They give all the a nice summary. They give all the artifacts and they kick off the um artifacts and they kick off the um artifacts and they kick off the um tracking, you know, we have a unified tracking, you know, we have a unified tracking, you know, we have a unified security guideline and we stick to it security guideline and we stick to it security guideline and we stick to it and and we quote him and we say, "Hey, and and we quote him and we say, "Hey, and and we quote him and we say, "Hey, this is a medium. You have x number of this is a medium. You have x number of this is a medium. You have x number of days. Let's get going." And so that days. Let's get going." And so that days. Let's get going." And so that along with PER analysts right who are along with PER analysts right who are along with PER analysts right who are leading the prioritization and the leading the prioritization and the leading the prioritization and the commanding of the incident as the commanding of the incident as the commanding of the incident as the vulnerability is confirmed and action vulnerability is confirmed and action vulnerability is confirmed and action items begin to be tasked right how do I items begin to be tasked right how do I items begin to be tasked right how do I start you know I have to start start you know I have to start start you know I have to start commanding this I have to start commanding this I have to start commanding this I have to start shephering this and then finally product shephering this and then finally product shephering this and then finally product engineering right is looped into engineering right is looped into engineering right is looped into conversations conversations conversations um as soon as we've like confirmed the um as soon as we've like confirmed the um as soon as we've like confirmed the bone right so we have um issues right uh bone right so we have um issues right uh bone right so we have um issues right uh we use GitHub to secure GitHub on GitHub we use GitHub to secure GitHub on GitHub we use GitHub to secure GitHub on GitHub I think I said it right um but So we we I think I said it right um but So we we I think I said it right um but So we we use GitHub issues, right? And and so the use GitHub issues, right? And and so the use GitHub issues, right? And and so the vulnerability is confirmed, the vulnerability is confirmed, the vulnerability is confirmed, the engineering team is checking it out, and engineering team is checking it out, and engineering team is checking it out, and then finally, you know, um they're then finally, you know, um they're then finally, you know, um they're they're working and starting to think they're working and starting to think they're working and starting to think about the remediation and mitigation about the remediation and mitigation about the remediation and mitigation efforts. Um and and so we use, you know, efforts. Um and and so we use, you know, efforts. Um and and so we use, you know, like I said earlier, we have our like I said earlier, we have our like I said earlier, we have our automation, we use, you know, um all of automation, we use, you know, um all of automation, we use, you know, um all of our skills independently to kind of our skills independently to kind of our skills independently to kind of shepherd us into the right way, right? shepherd us into the right way, right? shepherd us into the right way, right? command us into we have to prioritize command us into we have to prioritize command us into we have to prioritize this because XYZ and having an open this because XYZ and having an open this because XYZ and having an open communication that's very important communication that's very important communication that's very important right a blameless like um uh right a blameless like um uh right a blameless like um uh communication really helps drive to communication really helps drive to communication really helps drive to remediation much faster when it doesn't remediation much faster when it doesn't remediation much faster when it doesn't feel like you're getting hammered for um feel like you're getting hammered for um feel like you're getting hammered for um you know um answer on why the you know um answer on why the you know um answer on why the vulnerability exists. Um and so for vulnerability exists. Um and so for vulnerability exists. Um and so for training and education for this portion training and education for this portion training and education for this portion right we essentially have for book right we essentially have for book right we essentially have for book bounding it's essentially a lot of tone bounding it's essentially a lot of tone bounding it's essentially a lot of tone and channeling the GitHub voice right and channeling the GitHub voice right and channeling the GitHub voice right the communication between the researcher the communication between the researcher the communication between the researcher and and the bounty program um is and and the bounty program um is and and the bounty program um is different right than the communication different right than the communication different right than the communication of first responder and engineering right of first responder and engineering right of first responder and engineering right but they are very important in in you but they are very important in in you but they are very important in in you know differently but um channeling that know differently but um channeling that know differently but um channeling that voice and making sure that there's a ton voice and making sure that there's a ton voice and making sure that there's a ton of training and documentation so you can of training and documentation so you can of training and documentation so you can consistently communicate um as well as consistently communicate um as well as consistently communicate um as well as first responder training, right? So, you first responder training, right? So, you first responder training, right? So, you want a lot of documentation. You want a want a lot of documentation. You want a want a lot of documentation. You want a lot of shadowing going on, right? A lot lot of shadowing going on, right? A lot lot of shadowing going on, right? A lot of crossraining and knowledge dumps, of crossraining and knowledge dumps, of crossraining and knowledge dumps, right? Like, hey, how did you approach right? Like, hey, how did you approach right? Like, hey, how did you approach this and why? Um when you were working this and why? Um when you were working this and why? Um when you were working on this incident, right, which was a on this incident, right, which was a on this incident, right, which was a critical at the time, how did you go for critical at the time, how did you go for critical at the time, how did you go for it? How did you go about it? Um and it? How did you go about it? Um and it? How did you go about it? Um and reverse shadowing and all of those reverse shadowing and all of those reverse shadowing and all of those really play like a key fundamental for really play like a key fundamental for really play like a key fundamental for the triage phase. And so, now we're the triage phase. And so, now we're the triage phase. And so, now we're moving on to the third one. So moving on to the third one. So moving on to the third one. So engineering is pushing out fixed PRs, engineering is pushing out fixed PRs, engineering is pushing out fixed PRs, right, to fix and remediate the issue. right, to fix and remediate the issue. right, to fix and remediate the issue. Product is involved with any decisions Product is involved with any decisions Product is involved with any decisions that need to be made if any as a result that need to be made if any as a result that need to be made if any as a result of the vulnerability, right? Um bounty of the vulnerability, right? Um bounty of the vulnerability, right? Um bounty engineers are retesting the uh proof of engineers are retesting the uh proof of engineers are retesting the uh proof of concepts. They're looking for potential concepts. They're looking for potential concepts. They're looking for potential variance and they're discussing rewards variance and they're discussing rewards variance and they're discussing rewards to compensate the finding if applicable. to compensate the finding if applicable. to compensate the finding if applicable. Right? depends on the source. But if Right? depends on the source. But if Right? depends on the source. But if it's you know a you know program it's you know a you know program it's you know a you know program submission you you leverage prior R you submission you you leverage prior R you submission you you leverage prior R you leverage mutation and all the things leverage mutation and all the things leverage mutation and all the things that are very doable and repeatable. Um that are very doable and repeatable. Um that are very doable and repeatable. Um oops sorry um all right so we are still oops sorry um all right so we are still oops sorry um all right so we are still in remediation. in remediation. in remediation. Um okay so yeah and then we have you know okay so yeah and then we have you know okay so yeah and then we have you know GitHub engineering boot camp everyone GitHub engineering boot camp everyone GitHub engineering boot camp everyone learns via our boot camp how to use learns via our boot camp how to use learns via our boot camp how to use GitHub to secure GitHub right so opening GitHub to secure GitHub right so opening GitHub to secure GitHub right so opening the PRs opening the issues like you know the PRs opening the issues like you know the PRs opening the issues like you know merging all of the the GitHub stuff merging all of the the GitHub stuff merging all of the the GitHub stuff right so that's where training and right so that's where training and right so that's where training and education kind of comes in for just education kind of comes in for just education kind of comes in for just knowing our platform form and also knowing our platform form and also knowing our platform form and also command train, right? Um like I said command train, right? Um like I said command train, right? Um like I said earlier, right? That cross that that earlier, right? That cross that that earlier, right? That cross that that like shadowing and that like um command like shadowing and that like um command like shadowing and that like um command commanding like all of that is part of commanding like all of that is part of commanding like all of that is part of that baked into the the that baked into the the that baked into the the training. And finally, we have training. And finally, we have training. And finally, we have disclosure, right? Which the stakeholder disclosure, right? Which the stakeholder disclosure, right? Which the stakeholder list is long. We listed three just just list is long. We listed three just just list is long. We listed three just just for kicks and giggles, but we could have for kicks and giggles, but we could have for kicks and giggles, but we could have put them all, right? Everyone is put them all, right? Everyone is put them all, right? Everyone is important when it comes to the the e important when it comes to the the e important when it comes to the the e system of hey we're disclosing this you system of hey we're disclosing this you system of hey we're disclosing this you know and then everyone goes in and know and then everyone goes in and know and then everyone goes in and starts rigging the comms and and you starts rigging the comms and and you starts rigging the comms and and you know I don't like how this is framed I know I don't like how this is framed I know I don't like how this is framed I don't like this you know and so and all don't like this you know and so and all don't like this you know and so and all of that is is legit they're valid of that is is legit they're valid of that is is legit they're valid concerns and as a team as a company you concerns and as a team as a company you concerns and as a team as a company you have to take them in account everyone's have to take them in account everyone's have to take them in account everyone's perspective is just as important but you perspective is just as important but you perspective is just as important but you have a mission and and sometimes they're have a mission and and sometimes they're have a mission and and sometimes they're driven by deadlines or driven by certain driven by deadlines or driven by certain driven by deadlines or driven by certain you know um foundations like you know um foundations like you know um foundations like transparency first, right? Um, we want transparency first, right? Um, we want transparency first, right? Um, we want to be transparent. What's the best form to be transparent. What's the best form to be transparent. What's the best form of communication to be transparent for of communication to be transparent for of communication to be transparent for this one? Should we do an email to every this one? Should we do an email to every this one? Should we do an email to every affected user? Should we do a CVE, a affected user? Should we do a CVE, a affected user? Should we do a CVE, a blog post for, you know, wider blog post for, you know, wider blog post for, you know, wider visibility? Should we just do a change visibility? Should we just do a change visibility? Should we just do a change log like we usually do, you know, and log like we usually do, you know, and log like we usually do, you know, and and you don't make these up on the fly, and you don't make these up on the fly, and you don't make these up on the fly, right? Ideally, and in, you know, the right? Ideally, and in, you know, the right? Ideally, and in, you know, the way we do things, we leverage a lot of way we do things, we leverage a lot of way we do things, we leverage a lot of prior art. we leverage a lot of prior prior art. we leverage a lot of prior prior art. we leverage a lot of prior experience to decide which way to go and experience to decide which way to go and experience to decide which way to go and and if you're just starting I would and if you're just starting I would and if you're just starting I would really recommend to just always document really recommend to just always document really recommend to just always document as you go on why that happened because as you go on why that happened because as you go on why that happened because you know you'll build up you become like you know you'll build up you become like you know you'll build up you become like a historian after a while and and that a historian after a while and and that a historian after a while and and that like really helps decide all right we like really helps decide all right we like really helps decide all right we did this you know we did a blog post for did this you know we did a blog post for did this you know we did a blog post for this type of bone in the past and this this type of bone in the past and this this type of bone in the past and this new one that came in is a little bit you new one that came in is a little bit you new one that came in is a little bit you know more severe we that's like the know more severe we that's like the know more severe we that's like the baseline we need to do a blog post at baseline we need to do a blog post at baseline we need to do a blog post at minimum you know and that helps kind minimum you know and that helps kind minimum you know and that helps kind make these decisions when everything make these decisions when everything make these decisions when everything looks like it's on fire, right? Um, and looks like it's on fire, right? Um, and looks like it's on fire, right? Um, and so using prior art, using lessons so using prior art, using lessons so using prior art, using lessons learned, and documenting as you go, learned, and documenting as you go, learned, and documenting as you go, right, which sometimes is hard, right? right, which sometimes is hard, right? right, which sometimes is hard, right? It's like I'm already in a ton of It's like I'm already in a ton of It's like I'm already in a ton of meetings. I'm already in the incident, meetings. I'm already in the incident, meetings. I'm already in the incident, like I don't have time to document like I don't have time to document like I don't have time to document something, but it does go a long way, something, but it does go a long way, something, but it does go a long way, right? So documenting your lessons right? So documenting your lessons right? So documenting your lessons learned le, you know, documenting for learned le, you know, documenting for learned le, you know, documenting for prior really goes a long way along with prior really goes a long way along with prior really goes a long way along with the get voice, right? for us just cons, the get voice, right? for us just cons, the get voice, right? for us just cons, you know, leveraging our consistent you know, leveraging our consistent you know, leveraging our consistent comms and comms and comms and language. And so, finally, a bonus slide language. And so, finally, a bonus slide language. And so, finally, a bonus slide for y'all is uh being able to easily for y'all is uh being able to easily for y'all is uh being able to easily align to these frameworks and align to these frameworks and align to these frameworks and incorporate them into our processes and incorporate them into our processes and incorporate them into our processes and more importantly, our mission. And it more importantly, our mission. And it more importantly, our mission. And it has other perks. It makes audit season a has other perks. It makes audit season a has other perks. It makes audit season a breeze since our docs are already using breeze since our docs are already using breeze since our docs are already using a shared language in the industry with a shared language in the industry with a shared language in the industry with some GitHub voice flare, right? Um, you some GitHub voice flare, right? Um, you some GitHub voice flare, right? Um, you get you get wins like this and uh, yeah, get you get wins like this and uh, yeah, get you get wins like this and uh, yeah, our audit team told us that and created our audit team told us that and created our audit team told us that and created a a really quick generator like a year a a really quick generator like a year a a really quick generator like a year ago and I lost it in the company. I said ago and I lost it in the company. I said ago and I lost it in the company. I said we crushed it and and we moved on moved we crushed it and and we moved on moved we crushed it and and we moved on moved on to the next thing. Um, and that's all on to the next thing. Um, and that's all on to the next thing. Um, and that's all I have. Um, that's all we have for you I have. Um, that's all we have for you I have. Um, that's all we have for you today. Any questions? And you know today. Any questions? And you know today. Any questions? And you know before that we want to thank the uh, before that we want to thank the uh, before that we want to thank the uh, organizers. Make sure you you say organizers. Make sure you you say organizers. Make sure you you say thanks. Organizing a conference is thanks. Organizing a conference is thanks. Organizing a conference is really hard. Um and thank you for coming really hard. Um and thank you for coming really hard. Um and thank you for coming right before lunch. Five minutes for questions. for the presentation. I have a question. for the presentation. I have a question. for the presentation. I have a question. I used to run a bug party program. No, I I used to run a bug party program. No, I I used to run a bug party program. No, I don't. What is your current experience don't. What is your current experience don't. What is your current experience with for example people using LLMs and with for example people using LLMs and with for example people using LLMs and other technology to submit uh what ends other technology to submit uh what ends other technology to submit uh what ends up being noise? What's your current up being noise? What's your current up being noise? What's your current noise to signal ratio and what are your noise to signal ratio and what are your noise to signal ratio and what are your techniques to optimize it? Um in short it's high right like the Um in short it's high right like the Um in short it's high right like the noise to signal is definitely high. Um noise to signal is definitely high. Um noise to signal is definitely high. Um we are seeing so many people learn about we are seeing so many people learn about we are seeing so many people learn about AI as it comes out and then you know AI as it comes out and then you know AI as it comes out and then you know learning again the next day or week as learning again the next day or week as learning again the next day or week as advancements are made. Um and there's a advancements are made. Um and there's a advancements are made. Um and there's a lot of buzz around it and a lot of lot of buzz around it and a lot of lot of buzz around it and a lot of skepticism around AI. So I think that skepticism around AI. So I think that skepticism around AI. So I think that also generates a lot of uh a lot of also generates a lot of uh a lot of also generates a lot of uh a lot of reports from folks who have expectations reports from folks who have expectations reports from folks who have expectations that might not be aligned with the that might not be aligned with the that might not be aligned with the actual technology itself. Um, so yeah, actual technology itself. Um, so yeah, actual technology itself. Um, so yeah, we're definitely still, you know, still we're definitely still, you know, still we're definitely still, you know, still discovering that as we develop an AI discovering that as we develop an AI discovering that as we develop an AI product, right? Uh but we do our best to product, right? Uh but we do our best to product, right? Uh but we do our best to kind of keep it efficient and uh when we kind of keep it efficient and uh when we kind of keep it efficient and uh when we identify that there's like a lot of identify that there's like a lot of identify that there's like a lot of noise coming in about a certain aspect noise coming in about a certain aspect noise coming in about a certain aspect like I'm sure everyone here has seen like I'm sure everyone here has seen like I'm sure everyone here has seen hallucinations as as a noise maker right hallucinations as as a noise maker right hallucinations as as a noise maker right uh we work with our internal teams um uh we work with our internal teams um uh we work with our internal teams um both like within security and both like within security and both like within security and communications to think like well how do communications to think like well how do communications to think like well how do we educate people right how do we get we educate people right how do we get we educate people right how do we get out there like what our expectations are out there like what our expectations are out there like what our expectations are in AI and like what what we kind of know in AI and like what what we kind of know in AI and like what what we kind of know is a risk but that it's worth pushing is a risk but that it's worth pushing is a risk but that it's worth pushing the technology forward. Um and so we the technology forward. Um and so we the technology forward. Um and so we work both on independent communication work both on independent communication work both on independent communication with each individual researcher. Uh but with each individual researcher. Uh but with each individual researcher. Uh but at scale trying to address like that at scale trying to address like that at scale trying to address like that confusion and bring as much clarity as confusion and bring as much clarity as confusion and bring as much clarity as we can into how we develop AI securely we can into how we develop AI securely we can into how we develop AI securely um and why certain things might not fall um and why certain things might not fall um and why certain things might not fall in code for a program. I hope that Yeah. in code for a program. I hope that Yeah. in code for a program. I hope that Yeah. So maybe a shameless plug, but my So maybe a shameless plug, but my So maybe a shameless plug, but my colleague Madison and Tobias at 14:30 in colleague Madison and Tobias at 14:30 in colleague Madison and Tobias at 14:30 in room 1C are are doing a workshop called room 1C are are doing a workshop called room 1C are are doing a workshop called vulnerability poker real or AI fake vulnerability poker real or AI fake vulnerability poker real or AI fake vulnerabilities. Yeah, I'm gonna go to vulnerabilities. Yeah, I'm gonna go to vulnerabilities. Yeah, I'm gonna go to that one. that one. that one. No, no. I for one am grateful that I am No, no. I for one am grateful that I am No, no. I for one am grateful that I am not no longer managing a bug bounty not no longer managing a bug bounty not no longer managing a bug bounty program in the year of 2025. So kudos to program in the year of 2025. So kudos to program in the year of 2025. So kudos to all of you that are doing it. all of you that are doing it. all of you that are doing it. Thank you for the question. Nice Thank you for the question. Nice Thank you for the question. Nice presentation. Thank you for that. Uh my presentation. Thank you for that. Uh my presentation. Thank you for that. Uh my question you mentioned that you start question you mentioned that you start question you mentioned that you start with this question uh you mention also three the self uh you mention also three the self uh you mention also three the self assessment which is assessment which is assessment which is not what you know or you uh yeah so we started with um started uh yeah so we started with um started uh yeah so we started with um started with NIST and that's how we built those with NIST and that's how we built those with NIST and that's how we built those organizational foundations. Uh the SIM 3 organizational foundations. Uh the SIM 3 organizational foundations. Uh the SIM 3 tool was part of the application process tool was part of the application process tool was part of the application process for first. So that was the tool we used for first. So that was the tool we used for first. So that was the tool we used to kind of show where our maturity was. to kind of show where our maturity was. to kind of show where our maturity was. uh and at that time we had a separate uh and at that time we had a separate uh and at that time we had a separate seert and psert uh but we were trying to seert and psert uh but we were trying to seert and psert uh but we were trying to get in as a as a whole company right so get in as a as a whole company right so get in as a as a whole company right so uh part of the assessment is making sure uh part of the assessment is making sure uh part of the assessment is making sure that your company is ready not just a that your company is ready not just a that your company is ready not just a single team um and so that was why we single team um and so that was why we single team um and so that was why we use that sim 3 even though it's use that sim 3 even though it's use that sim 3 even though it's primarily a caesar framework and you primarily a caesar framework and you primarily a caesar framework and you know mist was high level but and covered know mist was high level but and covered know mist was high level but and covered both teams so for us it wasn't really so both teams so for us it wasn't really so both teams so for us it wasn't really so much like I wouldn't even say we moved much like I wouldn't even say we moved much like I wouldn't even say we moved off of n we built on top of it, right? off of n we built on top of it, right? off of n we built on top of it, right? Uh and so the pie services framework, Uh and so the pie services framework, Uh and so the pie services framework, the reason we really leaned in there and the reason we really leaned in there and the reason we really leaned in there and if anybody here has not read it, it's if anybody here has not read it, it's if anybody here has not read it, it's very detailed and it's a really great very detailed and it's a really great very detailed and it's a really great opport like take the opportunity to look opport like take the opportunity to look opport like take the opportunity to look through it. Um it was a real driver for through it. Um it was a real driver for through it. Um it was a real driver for us to meet that application as quickly us to meet that application as quickly us to meet that application as quickly as we did. Uh we were excited to get as we did. Uh we were excited to get as we did. Uh we were excited to get here. Um and I hope that covers your here. Um and I hope that covers your here. Um and I hope that covers your question. It was just more about like question. It was just more about like question. It was just more about like getting more product specific in our IR getting more product specific in our IR getting more product specific in our IR program. Thank you. Yes, definitely. program. Thank you. Yes, definitely. program. Thank you. Yes, definitely. Well, we're at time, but thank you guys Well, we're at time, but thank you guys Well, we're at time, but thank you guys so much for coming.
