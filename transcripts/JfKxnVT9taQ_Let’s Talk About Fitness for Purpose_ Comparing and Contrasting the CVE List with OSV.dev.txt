Very grateful for the opportunity year. Very grateful for the opportunity to be able to speak given the the to be able to speak given the the to be able to speak given the the circumstances uh particularly uh to the circumstances uh particularly uh to the circumstances uh particularly uh to the open SSF for a bit of travel assistance open SSF for a bit of travel assistance open SSF for a bit of travel assistance to be able to be here in person. I'm to be able to be here in person. I'm to be able to be here in person. I'm expanding on some of the areas that I expanding on some of the areas that I expanding on some of the areas that I touched on in my presentation from touched on in my presentation from touched on in my presentation from BonCon last year around observations of BonCon last year around observations of BonCon last year around observations of and thoughts on the challenges in and thoughts on the challenges in and thoughts on the challenges in vulnerability metadata quality. Uh for vulnerability metadata quality. Uh for vulnerability metadata quality. Uh for context, if you're not familiar with context, if you're not familiar with context, if you're not familiar with last year's talk or who I am, I'm last year's talk or who I am, I'm last year's talk or who I am, I'm Andrew. I'm from Australia. I get up at Andrew. I'm from Australia. I get up at Andrew. I'm from Australia. I get up at early to be in some working group early to be in some working group early to be in some working group meetings sometimes um based in Brisbane. meetings sometimes um based in Brisbane. meetings sometimes um based in Brisbane. I've spent the last couple of years I've spent the last couple of years I've spent the last couple of years working on Google's open source security working on Google's open source security working on Google's open source security team working on uh OSV in particular and team working on uh OSV in particular and team working on uh OSV in particular and it's been it's probably been the it's been it's probably been the it's been it's probably been the highlight of my two decade career at at highlight of my two decade career at at highlight of my two decade career at at Google. So, I've really had a lot of Google. So, I've really had a lot of Google. So, I've really had a lot of fun. fun. fun. And an area of passion for me is is And an area of passion for me is is And an area of passion for me is is around data quality and consistency and around data quality and consistency and around data quality and consistency and completeness. completeness. completeness. So in a nutshell, the the work that I I So in a nutshell, the the work that I I So in a nutshell, the the work that I I did that led me to to sort of get to did that led me to to sort of get to did that led me to to sort of get to where to where I am right right now is where to where I am right right now is where to where I am right right now is uh I wrote some code to take CVS from uh I wrote some code to take CVS from uh I wrote some code to take CVS from the the the NBD using the CPE dictionary, try to NBD using the CPE dictionary, try to NBD using the CPE dictionary, try to determine the git repository for the determine the git repository for the determine the git repository for the source code and the software the CVE source code and the software the CVE source code and the software the CVE referred to and referred to and referred to and then use that to generate an an OSV then use that to generate an an OSV then use that to generate an an OSV record. record. record. and then do all of the things that you'd and then do all of the things that you'd and then do all of the things that you'd want to do with with with an OSV want to do with with with an OSV want to do with with with an OSV record. This is the percentage of CVEes record. This is the percentage of CVEes record. This is the percentage of CVEes that have been deemed to be in scope for that have been deemed to be in scope for that have been deemed to be in scope for conversion that have actually conversion that have actually conversion that have actually successfully converted. It it's been successfully converted. It it's been successfully converted. It it's been pleasingly consistent. Hang on. There pleasingly consistent. Hang on. There pleasingly consistent. Hang on. There there it is. Um it's been pleasingly there it is. Um it's been pleasingly there it is. Um it's been pleasingly consistent year year to year. Uh you can consistent year year to year. Uh you can consistent year year to year. Uh you can see that the NBD see that the NBD see that the NBD analysis slowdown did have a a bit of a analysis slowdown did have a a bit of a analysis slowdown did have a a bit of a a negative impact on it. Uh the primary a negative impact on it. Uh the primary a negative impact on it. Uh the primary intended benefit of this work is to gain intended benefit of this work is to gain intended benefit of this work is to gain coverage of C and C++ vulnerabilities as coverage of C and C++ vulnerabilities as coverage of C and C++ vulnerabilities as there's no comprehensive there's no comprehensive there's no comprehensive centralized source of them due to the centralized source of them due to the centralized source of them due to the somewhat unique nature of how open- somewhat unique nature of how open- somewhat unique nature of how open- source C and C++ software is used. The source C and C++ software is used. The source C and C++ software is used. The most effective way to scan for this in most effective way to scan for this in most effective way to scan for this in source code is by commit hash. And so source code is by commit hash. And so source code is by commit hash. And so that that that was the whole the whole that that that was the whole the whole that that that was the whole the whole sort of purpose of this exercise was was sort of purpose of this exercise was was sort of purpose of this exercise was was to have commit level vulnerability to have commit level vulnerability to have commit level vulnerability metadata on on on those CVEs. You can metadata on on on those CVEs. You can metadata on on on those CVEs. You can read more about the that work and the read more about the that work and the read more about the that work and the application of it on the osc.dev application of it on the osc.dev application of it on the osc.dev blog. When I came into this work this blog. When I came into this work this blog. When I came into this work this this task this project I was a complete this task this project I was a complete this task this project I was a complete newcomer to the newcomer to the newcomer to the state-of-the-art in CVE. Like I I was state-of-the-art in CVE. Like I I was state-of-the-art in CVE. Like I I was around back when in 99 when when CVS around back when in 99 when when CVS around back when in 99 when when CVS came out. I didn't work in any sort of came out. I didn't work in any sort of came out. I didn't work in any sort of vulnerability capacity back then, so I vulnerability capacity back then, so I vulnerability capacity back then, so I had to sort of catch up with where had to sort of catch up with where had to sort of catch up with where things were at. I spent some time things were at. I spent some time things were at. I spent some time learning about how the entire sausage learning about how the entire sausage learning about how the entire sausage was made, probably in the most was made, probably in the most was made, probably in the most sub-optimal way to be honest, but I sub-optimal way to be honest, but I sub-optimal way to be honest, but I think a lot of people up until last year think a lot of people up until last year think a lot of people up until last year didn't appreciate that the NVD was not didn't appreciate that the NVD was not didn't appreciate that the NVD was not the CVE list. So, uh, myself included the CVE list. So, uh, myself included the CVE list. So, uh, myself included because, you know, my brief was convert because, you know, my brief was convert because, you know, my brief was convert from the NVD. I'm like, cool, okay. And from the NVD. I'm like, cool, okay. And from the NVD. I'm like, cool, okay. And then yeah, I learned about the entire then yeah, I learned about the entire then yeah, I learned about the entire thing in more detail than I think most thing in more detail than I think most thing in more detail than I think most people necessarily know. And I'm happy people necessarily know. And I'm happy people necessarily know. And I'm happy to share that later on if you don't to share that later on if you don't to share that later on if you don't know. Last year's call to action from know. Last year's call to action from know. Last year's call to action from from from my talk was uh to address a couple of the the uh to address a couple of the the uh to address a couple of the the systemic challenges that I was seeing in systemic challenges that I was seeing in systemic challenges that I was seeing in the data quality as part of that the data quality as part of that the data quality as part of that conversion effort. conversion effort. conversion effort. And in the ensuing time since since last And in the ensuing time since since last And in the ensuing time since since last year's Vongcon and you know I I had some year's Vongcon and you know I I had some year's Vongcon and you know I I had some excellent hallway conversations off the excellent hallway conversations off the excellent hallway conversations off the back of my talk and a lot of interesting back of my talk and a lot of interesting back of my talk and a lot of interesting follow-up conversations and I and I sort follow-up conversations and I and I sort follow-up conversations and I and I sort of more actively engaged with the QWG of more actively engaged with the QWG of more actively engaged with the QWG afterwards. Uh I've I've learned more afterwards. Uh I've I've learned more afterwards. Uh I've I've learned more and I've dug into the the problem more and I've dug into the the problem more and I've dug into the the problem more and we'll we'll take a bit more of a a and we'll we'll take a bit more of a a and we'll we'll take a bit more of a a specific look at that rather than last specific look at that rather than last specific look at that rather than last year's talk where I sort of talked about year's talk where I sort of talked about year's talk where I sort of talked about the the nature of the work. the the nature of the work. the the nature of the work. So I I picked a hopefully an interesting So I I picked a hopefully an interesting So I I picked a hopefully an interesting title to to bring you all here. Thanks title to to bring you all here. Thanks title to to bring you all here. Thanks for thanks for coming to my TED talk. Um for thanks for coming to my TED talk. Um for thanks for coming to my TED talk. Um fit fitness for purpose. I I like to fit fitness for purpose. I I like to fit fitness for purpose. I I like to think about why why are we doing this? think about why why are we doing this? think about why why are we doing this? Why do we have vulnerability metadata in Why do we have vulnerability metadata in Why do we have vulnerability metadata in the first place? It's so that the the first place? It's so that the the first place? It's so that the defenders and end users of of vulnerable defenders and end users of of vulnerable defenders and end users of of vulnerable software can know that they're impacted software can know that they're impacted software can know that they're impacted and then know how to make the problem go and then know how to make the problem go and then know how to make the problem go away. Pretty straightforward, right? away. Pretty straightforward, right? away. Pretty straightforward, right? So today I'll take you on a bit of an So today I'll take you on a bit of an So today I'll take you on a bit of an exploration of this and my takes on some exploration of this and my takes on some exploration of this and my takes on some of the barriers to achieving that why of the barriers to achieving that why of the barriers to achieving that why and um give you my my my thoughts on on and um give you my my my thoughts on on and um give you my my my thoughts on on some areas for improvement. But before I some areas for improvement. But before I some areas for improvement. But before I do that, I'll do a little bit of a do that, I'll do a little bit of a do that, I'll do a little bit of a sideby-side to the best of my ability sideby-side to the best of my ability sideby-side to the best of my ability comparison comparison comparison between my understanding of the CVE list between my understanding of the CVE list between my understanding of the CVE list and the current state state of things and the current state state of things and the current state state of things over the fence in the land of OSB. over the fence in the land of OSB. over the fence in the land of OSB. So for anybody unfamiliar with OSV, it's So for anybody unfamiliar with OSV, it's So for anybody unfamiliar with OSV, it's been around been around been around for four years and it's was created to for four years and it's was created to for four years and it's was created to facilitate precise identification of facilitate precise identification of facilitate precise identification of vulnerabilities in open source vulnerabilities in open source vulnerabilities in open source software. OSS fuzz was the catalyst software. OSS fuzz was the catalyst software. OSS fuzz was the catalyst because it was finding vulnerabilities because it was finding vulnerabilities because it was finding vulnerabilities in open source projects that it was it in open source projects that it was it in open source projects that it was it was fuzzing was fuzzing was fuzzing and we they wanted some way to be able and we they wanted some way to be able and we they wanted some way to be able to express those findings. And at the to express those findings. And at the to express those findings. And at the time, CV 4.0 was the was the time, CV 4.0 was the was the time, CV 4.0 was the was the state-of-the-art. It wasn't great at state-of-the-art. It wasn't great at state-of-the-art. It wasn't great at expressing vulnerabilities in open expressing vulnerabilities in open expressing vulnerabilities in open source. And in addition to that, the source. And in addition to that, the source. And in addition to that, the idea of automatic automatically idea of automatic automatically idea of automatic automatically submitting CVES sort of gave everybody submitting CVES sort of gave everybody submitting CVES sort of gave everybody the the hebies. So uh OSV popped up as a the the hebies. So uh OSV popped up as a the the hebies. So uh OSV popped up as a sort of parallel opportunity to to be sort of parallel opportunity to to be sort of parallel opportunity to to be able to express those vulnerabilities able to express those vulnerabilities able to express those vulnerabilities and in an automated and in an automated and in an automated fashion. Um when the open SSF formed fashion. Um when the open SSF formed fashion. Um when the open SSF formed uh we we donated Google donated the the uh we we donated Google donated the the uh we we donated Google donated the the OSV schema to to the open SSF as as as a OSV schema to to the open SSF as as as a OSV schema to to the open SSF as as as a bit of bit of bit of IP.

So, so we we sort of distributions. So, so we we sort of distributions. So, so we we sort of moved up the moved up the stack a little moved up the moved up the stack a little moved up the moved up the stack a little bit and and then yeah, like I said, the bit and and then yeah, like I said, the bit and and then yeah, like I said, the the the ultimate area of interest is to the the ultimate area of interest is to the the ultimate area of interest is to make container image scanning make container image scanning make container image scanning uh ubiquitously uh ubiquitously uh ubiquitously easy. So, getting into the comparisons easy. So, getting into the comparisons easy. So, getting into the comparisons now. Mission statements. I have a good now. Mission statements. I have a good now. Mission statements. I have a good mission statement. mission statement. mission statement. Um I like mission statements that can Um I like mission statements that can Um I like mission statements that can help with evaluating if an activity is help with evaluating if an activity is help with evaluating if an activity is on mission or not. And I think it's a on mission or not. And I think it's a on mission or not. And I think it's a good that that's a valid question to be good that that's a valid question to be good that that's a valid question to be asking from time to time to make sure asking from time to time to make sure asking from time to time to make sure that you haven't gone off into the that you haven't gone off into the that you haven't gone off into the weeds. I also like to be able to ask the weeds. I also like to be able to ask the weeds. I also like to be able to ask the question of when you when you when can question of when you when you when can question of when you when you when can you declare mission accomplished. The you declare mission accomplished. The you declare mission accomplished. The CVE program's mission statement has CVE program's mission statement has CVE program's mission statement has remained unchanged for 25 years. And I remained unchanged for 25 years. And I remained unchanged for 25 years. And I think that the lack of an explicit why think that the lack of an explicit why think that the lack of an explicit why in there is a little bit problematic in there is a little bit problematic in there is a little bit problematic because I think the why 25 years ago and because I think the why 25 years ago and because I think the why 25 years ago and the why the why the why today have changed a bit. Now, if you today have changed a bit. Now, if you today have changed a bit. Now, if you look at the look at the look at the OSV program's mission statement, it's a OSV program's mission statement, it's a OSV program's mission statement, it's a little bit more unequivocal as to why little bit more unequivocal as to why little bit more unequivocal as to why it's doing what it's doing. It's its it's doing what it's doing. It's its it's doing what it's doing. It's its ultimate goal is risk reduction. There's ultimate goal is risk reduction. There's ultimate goal is risk reduction. There's also a specific target audience. I would also a specific target audience. I would also a specific target audience. I would argue it's a little bit narrow narrower argue it's a little bit narrow narrower argue it's a little bit narrow narrower than it needs to be, but it is what it than it needs to be, but it is what it than it needs to be, but it is what it is. So, the CV program has a bit of an is. So, the CV program has a bit of an is. So, the CV program has a bit of an implicit all. OSV.dev's got a narrower implicit all. OSV.dev's got a narrower implicit all. OSV.dev's got a narrower scope. It's only open source related scope. It's only open source related scope. It's only open source related stuff. So, a little bit of an apples and stuff. So, a little bit of an apples and stuff. So, a little bit of an apples and oranges, but that is what it is. oranges, but that is what it is. oranges, but that is what it is. Scale-wise, like I said, 25 years for Scale-wise, like I said, 25 years for Scale-wise, like I said, 25 years for the CV program, very different world the CV program, very different world the CV program, very different world today. Back in today. Back in today. Back in 1999, the CV list had about 1500 1999, the CV list had about 1500 1999, the CV list had about 1500 vulnerabilities. That's actually vulnerabilities. That's actually vulnerabilities. That's actually declined by 20% in 2000 to only 1,200 or declined by 20% in 2000 to only 1,200 or declined by 20% in 2000 to only 1,200 or so. Uh, if you jump forward to 2024, I so. Uh, if you jump forward to 2024, I so. Uh, if you jump forward to 2024, I did all this off last year's data for a did all this off last year's data for a did all this off last year's data for a full year. The CVE list contained, but full year. The CVE list contained, but full year. The CVE list contained, but depending on how you count them, depending on how you count them, depending on how you count them, 37,381 vulnerabilities from 307 distinct 37,381 vulnerabilities from 307 distinct 37,381 vulnerabilities from 307 distinct CNAs. Now, if you compare that with what CNAs. Now, if you compare that with what CNAs. Now, if you compare that with what osb.dev's got, we've got uh 82,000 osb.dev's got, we've got uh 82,000 osb.dev's got, we've got uh 82,000 almost 83,000 vulnerabilities that that almost 83,000 vulnerabilities that that almost 83,000 vulnerabilities that that have a publication date from 2024 from have a publication date from 2024 from have a publication date from 2024 from 21 different home databases. of these in 21 different home databases. of these in 21 different home databases. of these in 2024 almost 10,000 of those those 2024 almost 10,000 of those those 2024 almost 10,000 of those those vulnerability records had a direct alias vulnerability records had a direct alias vulnerability records had a direct alias to a CVE ID and then another 58,000 of to a CVE ID and then another 58,000 of to a CVE ID and then another 58,000 of them had some sort of a cross reference. them had some sort of a cross reference. them had some sort of a cross reference. There's a few different ways you can There's a few different ways you can There's a few different ways you can express a relationship to other record express a relationship to other record express a relationship to other record IDs. So unsurprisingly given that IDs. So unsurprisingly given that IDs. So unsurprisingly given that difference in scope there's also and difference in scope there's also and difference in scope there's also and also the age difference remember this is also the age difference remember this is also the age difference remember this is four years old uh we've got some four years old uh we've got some four years old uh we've got some significant variation in the sources of significant variation in the sources of significant variation in the sources of record. So all up you've got uh record. So all up you've got uh record. So all up you've got uh 447 CNAs as of the end of last year and 447 CNAs as of the end of last year and 447 CNAs as of the end of last year and 125 of them having some sort of a 125 of them having some sort of a 125 of them having some sort of a declaration of relating to open declaration of relating to open declaration of relating to open source. There's a little bit of source. There's a little bit of source. There's a little bit of funkiness with that with with with funkiness with that with with with funkiness with that with with with around how you count that because uh around how you count that because uh around how you count that because uh types is is a you can have more than one types is is a you can have more than one types is is a you can have more than one type on a on a CNA in the metadata. So type on a on a CNA in the metadata. So type on a on a CNA in the metadata. So it's it's not necessarily a hard number. it's it's not necessarily a hard number. it's it's not necessarily a hard number. Uh and CNAs can wear multiple hats as as Uh and CNAs can wear multiple hats as as Uh and CNAs can wear multiple hats as as as you know. Uh OSV has 22 what we call as you know. Uh OSV has 22 what we call as you know. Uh OSV has 22 what we call home home home databases. And so they they they that is databases. And so they they they that is databases. And so they they they that is the moral equivalent of a CNA for for the moral equivalent of a CNA for for the moral equivalent of a CNA for for for comparison purposes. They own their for comparison purposes. They own their for comparison purposes. They own their records. They publish their records and records. They publish their records and records. They publish their records and then then then obsc.dev does a pull on them. So, I'll I'll just do a little side trip So, I'll I'll just do a little side trip So, I'll I'll just do a little side trip on on on scale for a moment because I on on on scale for a moment because I on on on scale for a moment because I think scale is a challenge. Like scale think scale is a challenge. Like scale think scale is a challenge. Like scale is is why we are where we're where we're is is why we are where we're where we're is is why we are where we're where we're at today. So, we know that along with at today. So, we know that along with at today. So, we know that along with death and taxes, there's another death and taxes, there's another death and taxes, there's another certainty that there'll be more certainty that there'll be more certainty that there'll be more vulnerabilities next year than there vulnerabilities next year than there vulnerabilities next year than there were this year. Like, we've got we've were this year. Like, we've got we've were this year. Like, we've got we've got 25 years worth of evidence to to got 25 years worth of evidence to to got 25 years worth of evidence to to basically show that that's an up and to basically show that that's an up and to basically show that that's an up and to the right the right the right movement. movement. movement. Sadly, that's the case, right? Like I Sadly, that's the case, right? Like I Sadly, that's the case, right? Like I think we all look forward to a day when think we all look forward to a day when think we all look forward to a day when when that truism isn't the case anymore. when that truism isn't the case anymore. when that truism isn't the case anymore. But but that's sort of the world we live But but that's sort of the world we live But but that's sort of the world we live in now. That level of vulnerabilities is in now. That level of vulnerabilities is in now. That level of vulnerabilities is hard for everybody that's in the space, hard for everybody that's in the space, hard for everybody that's in the space, right? Like it's hard for vendors to right? Like it's hard for vendors to right? Like it's hard for vendors to keep on top of. It's hard for defenders keep on top of. It's hard for defenders keep on top of. It's hard for defenders to keep on top of and it's hard for to keep on top of and it's hard for to keep on top of and it's hard for analysts to to have to do things like analysts to to have to do things like analysts to to have to do things like like you feel like that scale the NVD is like you feel like that scale the NVD is like you feel like that scale the NVD is is a casualty of that scale, right? is a casualty of that scale, right? is a casualty of that scale, right? Because there's a there's a human Because there's a there's a human Because there's a there's a human analysis component to to their work. and and you know we only you know and and you know we only you know and and you know we only you know there's the data on that right we only there's the data on that right we only there's the data on that right we only saw about half of the ones from last saw about half of the ones from last saw about half of the ones from last year able to be to be analyzed by by the year able to be to be analyzed by by the year able to be to be analyzed by by the NBD as a result and if you look at you NBD as a result and if you look at you NBD as a result and if you look at you know SIS's bone enrichment know SIS's bone enrichment know SIS's bone enrichment uh progress last year they had varying uh progress last year they had varying uh progress last year they had varying degrees of of coverage as well depending degrees of of coverage as well depending degrees of of coverage as well depending on how you you count what they did I think it's ultimately like you can did I think it's ultimately like you can did I think it's ultimately like you can you can boost that with things like you can boost that with things like you can boost that with things like potentially Ryan's really cool project. potentially Ryan's really cool project. potentially Ryan's really cool project. That's a really cool thing to lead in That's a really cool thing to lead in That's a really cool thing to lead in with. Good. Good job with the program with. Good. Good job with the program with. Good. Good job with the program there, Cro. there, Cro. there, Cro. Um to to sort of optimize that a little Um to to sort of optimize that a little Um to to sort of optimize that a little bit, but but there is an bit, but but there is an bit, but but there is an inherent amount inherent amount inherent amount of human effort that goes into analysis, of human effort that goes into analysis, of human effort that goes into analysis, right? So, so you can you can optimize right? So, so you can you can optimize right? So, so you can you can optimize that only so much with with scale before that only so much with with scale before that only so much with with scale before before it just has a fan out problem. before it just has a fan out problem. before it just has a fan out problem. And I don't work on the analysis side, And I don't work on the analysis side, And I don't work on the analysis side, but I can only imagine what that must but I can only imagine what that must but I can only imagine what that must feel like. I'm sure if you hit up the feel like. I'm sure if you hit up the feel like. I'm sure if you hit up the the friends in the NBD and invol the friends in the NBD and invol the friends in the NBD and invol Richmond enrichment, they've probably Richmond enrichment, they've probably Richmond enrichment, they've probably got some great war stories they could got some great war stories they could got some great war stories they could they could share with you over an adult they could share with you over an adult they could share with you over an adult beverage at some point. So what do you beverage at some point. So what do you beverage at some point. So what do you do? You you automate, right? So you send do? You you automate, right? So you send do? You you automate, right? So you send in the machines. The only reason the in the machines. The only reason the in the machines. The only reason the only way to reason about vulnerabilities only way to reason about vulnerabilities only way to reason about vulnerabilities at that sort of scale is at that sort of scale is at that sort of scale is programmatically or maybe with AI uh programmatically or maybe with AI uh programmatically or maybe with AI uh minus the hallucinations. This helps the minus the hallucinations. This helps the minus the hallucinations. This helps the humans with the detection, the higher humans with the detection, the higher humans with the detection, the higher order things like classification, order things like classification, order things like classification, validation, and prioritization, and validation, and prioritization, and validation, and prioritization, and ultimately remediation or mitigation of ultimately remediation or mitigation of ultimately remediation or mitigation of them. So once the vulnerability records them. So once the vulnerability records them. So once the vulnerability records out in the wild, defenders need to be out in the wild, defenders need to be out in the wild, defenders need to be able to act on it as quickly as they are able to act on it as quickly as they are able to act on it as quickly as they are able to. And so the less systematic able to. And so the less systematic able to. And so the less systematic barriers to that that response ability, barriers to that that response ability, barriers to that that response ability, the better for everybody. So fortunately the better for everybody. So fortunately the better for everybody. So fortunately the CVE program realized this back in the CVE program realized this back in the CVE program realized this back in 2018 uh when we were only dealing only 2018 uh when we were only dealing only 2018 uh when we were only dealing only dealing with 17,000 odd CVS and they dealing with 17,000 odd CVS and they dealing with 17,000 odd CVS and they launched the first iteration of a richer launched the first iteration of a richer launched the first iteration of a richer JSON format and as an attempt to address JSON format and as an attempt to address JSON format and as an attempt to address some of the deficiencies with that some of the deficiencies with that some of the deficiencies with that format for describing open source format for describing open source format for describing open source vulnerabilities as I said uh the OSV vulnerabilities as I said uh the OSV vulnerabilities as I said uh the OSV schema and OSVE.dev dev which used it schema and OSVE.dev dev which used it schema and OSVE.dev dev which used it launched in 2021 when we were dealing launched in 2021 when we were dealing launched in 2021 when we were dealing with 23,000 CVES and then in 2022 we had with 23,000 CVES and then in 2022 we had with 23,000 CVES and then in 2022 we had the really big uplift with we're at the really big uplift with we're at the really big uplift with we're at 26,000 CVEes and the first iteration of 26,000 CVEes and the first iteration of 26,000 CVEes and the first iteration of the CV JSON 5 schema came out and that the CV JSON 5 schema came out and that the CV JSON 5 schema came out and that was that was a real game changer in was that was a real game changer in was that was a real game changer in terms of theoretical capability and the terms of theoretical capability and the terms of theoretical capability and the OSV schema had some influences on on OSV schema had some influences on on OSV schema had some influences on on that because you know we we we came out that because you know we we we came out that because you know we we we came out with that first when the the CV5 schema with that first when the the CV5 schema with that first when the the CV5 schema was being developed, we sort of rocked was being developed, we sort of rocked was being developed, we sort of rocked up and said, "Hey, take a look at this." up and said, "Hey, take a look at this." up and said, "Hey, take a look at this." And and so the there's there's there's And and so the there's there's there's And and so the there's there's there's some influences there and there's some some influences there and there's some some influences there and there's some theoretical interoperability as well as theoretical interoperability as well as theoretical interoperability as well as a a a result. So, and then this is where I result. So, and then this is where I result. So, and then this is where I start to get a little bit sad. start to get a little bit sad. start to get a little bit sad. So, this is a quote I took out of the uh So, this is a quote I took out of the uh So, this is a quote I took out of the uh the very shiny 25th anniversary report. the very shiny 25th anniversary report. the very shiny 25th anniversary report. So it evolved with the needs of the time So it evolved with the needs of the time So it evolved with the needs of the time and we're at this current pinnacle of and we're at this current pinnacle of and we're at this current pinnacle of theoretical theoretical machine theoretical theoretical machine theoretical theoretical machine readability and that is the rub my readability and that is the rub my readability and that is the rub my friends. Just because it can doesn't friends. Just because it can doesn't friends. Just because it can doesn't mean it is. Jerry Gamblin really drove mean it is. Jerry Gamblin really drove mean it is. Jerry Gamblin really drove this point home earlier in the week uh this point home earlier in the week uh this point home earlier in the week uh yesterday actually. 25 years later, yesterday actually. 25 years later, yesterday actually. 25 years later, sorry, must not rant too hard. uh 25 sorry, must not rant too hard. uh 25 sorry, must not rant too hard. uh 25 years later when we were at 20 times the years later when we were at 20 times the years later when we were at 20 times the volume of CVEs than we were when we volume of CVEs than we were when we volume of CVEs than we were when we first came along with this this thing first came along with this this thing first came along with this this thing nothing has changed in terms of what is nothing has changed in terms of what is nothing has changed in terms of what is required to be in a CV record right so required to be in a CV record right so required to be in a CV record right so when we first started this remember 20 when we first started this remember 20 when we first started this remember 20 times less volume than what we're times less volume than what we're times less volume than what we're dealing with now you needed an ID a dealing with now you needed an ID a dealing with now you needed an ID a description and maybe one or more description and maybe one or more description and maybe one or more references that's the same deal 25 years references that's the same deal 25 years references that's the same deal 25 years later 25 years just The only thing worse than tantalizingly The only thing worse than tantalizingly The only thing worse than tantalizingly machine readable data is when it's machine readable data is when it's machine readable data is when it's inconsistently used. Here's one of my inconsistently used. Here's one of my inconsistently used. Here's one of my favorite things I like to wave favorite things I like to wave favorite things I like to wave around. I've got a hobby around. I've got a hobby around. I've got a hobby horse. Welcome to my TED talk. Last year horse. Welcome to my TED talk. Last year horse. Welcome to my TED talk. Last year 15% count them 15 15% count them 15 15% count them 15 15% of CVS had no attempt none zero 15% of CVS had no attempt none zero 15% of CVS had no attempt none zero attempt at usable data in in the attempt at usable data in in the attempt at usable data in in the affected affected affected field. I'm sad it's really really really field. I'm sad it's really really really field. I'm sad it's really really really difficult to accurately quantify the difficult to accurately quantify the difficult to accurately quantify the usability of the data that is present usability of the data that is present usability of the data that is present because hey if I could quantify it in a because hey if I could quantify it in a because hey if I could quantify it in a machine readable way it wouldn't be a machine readable way it wouldn't be a machine readable way it wouldn't be a problem. I looked at some and you know problem. I looked at some and you know problem. I looked at some and you know just eyeballing them as I was making just eyeballing them as I was making just eyeballing them as I was making this presentation this presentation this presentation um I could see versions claiming to be um I could see versions claiming to be um I could see versions claiming to be SER and I think Martin pointed that out SER and I think Martin pointed that out SER and I think Martin pointed that out this morning in his presentation. I love this morning in his presentation. I love this morning in his presentation. I love how many data quality theme talks there how many data quality theme talks there how many data quality theme talks there are this year by the way are this year by the way are this year by the way uh they're claiming to be sember they're uh they're claiming to be sember they're uh they're claiming to be sember they're clearly not right like they did they clearly not right like they did they clearly not right like they did they didn't have three bits or I've seen ones didn't have three bits or I've seen ones didn't have three bits or I've seen ones with asterisks in there and stuff like with asterisks in there and stuff like with asterisks in there and stuff like that. It's like come on guys. Um, that. It's like come on guys. Um, that. It's like come on guys. Um, so cool that we have version types, not so cool that we have version types, not so cool that we have version types, not cool that we're using them as as cool that we're using them as as cool that we're using them as as labeled, right? Um, so this inconsistent labeled, right? Um, so this inconsistent labeled, right? Um, so this inconsistent use use use um of the the record format undermines um of the the record format undermines um of the the record format undermines the great potential of machine the great potential of machine the great potential of machine readability. This hampers the ability to readability. This hampers the ability to readability. This hampers the ability to do meaningful vulnerability management do meaningful vulnerability management do meaningful vulnerability management in any way, shape, or form at scale, in any way, shape, or form at scale, in any way, shape, or form at scale, right? right? right? God do better. There is no remediation God do better. There is no remediation God do better. There is no remediation at scale without first detection at at scale without first detection at at scale without first detection at scale. And I feel like for the longest scale. And I feel like for the longest scale. And I feel like for the longest time identifying was declared done by time identifying was declared done by time identifying was declared done by the existence of the CVE ID itself and a the existence of the CVE ID itself and a the existence of the CVE ID itself and a human readable description. Right? That human readable description. Right? That human readable description. Right? That might have flown 25 years ago. It does might have flown 25 years ago. It does might have flown 25 years ago. It does not fly today when we are drowning in not fly today when we are drowning in not fly today when we are drowning in vulnerabilities. You've got to have vulnerabilities. You've got to have vulnerabilities. You've got to have something that is automation friendly something that is automation friendly something that is automation friendly and not just the capability, the and not just the capability, the and not just the capability, the theoretical capability. It has to be theoretical capability. It has to be theoretical capability. It has to be automation friendly. It has to be automation friendly. It has to be automation friendly. It has to be accurate. I I like the term that I've accurate. I I like the term that I've accurate. I I like the term that I've heard a few times this week, heard a few times this week, heard a few times this week, completeness of a record, right? So, you completeness of a record, right? So, you completeness of a record, right? So, you know, there's this concept now of is a know, there's this concept now of is a know, there's this concept now of is a CVE record complete if it's not CVE record complete if it's not CVE record complete if it's not automation friendly and accurate. So I understand the So I understand the So I understand the history, totally understand the history. history, totally understand the history. history, totally understand the history. The CV program had to federate to deal The CV program had to federate to deal The CV program had to federate to deal with with this with scaling with with this with scaling with with this with scaling challenges. If you've got no challenges. If you've got no challenges. If you've got no consistency, it it it's in the realms of consistency, it it it's in the realms of consistency, it it it's in the realms of pointless for it to be truly fit for pointless for it to be truly fit for pointless for it to be truly fit for purpose for direct end use detection or purpose for direct end use detection or purpose for direct end use detection or even analys downstream analysis or even analys downstream analysis or even analys downstream analysis or anything. The CNA that issues a CVE anything. The CNA that issues a CVE anything. The CNA that issues a CVE needs to be an implementation detail, needs to be an implementation detail, needs to be an implementation detail, particularly as we keep growing particularly as we keep growing particularly as we keep growing year-over-year with CNAs. Federation is year-over-year with CNAs. Federation is year-over-year with CNAs. Federation is very hard to do well and it's even very hard to do well and it's even very hard to do well and it's even harder to try and fix things up harder to try and fix things up harder to try and fix things up retrospectively, particularly while retrospectively, particularly while retrospectively, particularly while you're still federating like a like a you're still federating like a like a you're still federating like a like a demon, right? demon, right? demon, right? So, you haven't even shut the barn door So, you haven't even shut the barn door So, you haven't even shut the barn door and there's more horses coming out of and there's more horses coming out of and there's more horses coming out of it, right? So, that's unfortunately the it, right? So, that's unfortunately the it, right? So, that's unfortunately the position the CV program finds itself in. position the CV program finds itself in. position the CV program finds itself in. So this is the current ever growing So this is the current ever growing So this is the current ever growing number of unique snowflakes in the form number of unique snowflakes in the form number of unique snowflakes in the form of CNAs. So it's not feasible for the of CNAs. So it's not feasible for the of CNAs. So it's not feasible for the downstream consumers of the CVE list to downstream consumers of the CVE list to downstream consumers of the CVE list to have to maintain per CNA heristics for have to maintain per CNA heristics for have to maintain per CNA heristics for how a machine proc how to machine how a machine proc how to machine how a machine proc how to machine process a specific CVE right like that's process a specific CVE right like that's process a specific CVE right like that's that's that's just a losing battle right that's that's just a losing battle right that's that's just a losing battle right um this log scale chart shows that um this log scale chart shows that um this log scale chart shows that there's a steep drop off in terms of the there's a steep drop off in terms of the there's a steep drop off in terms of the volume of CVE per volume of CVE per volume of CVE per CNA and I'll talk about that a little CNA and I'll talk about that a little CNA and I'll talk about that a little bit more in a bit uh in one of the bit more in a bit uh in one of the bit more in a bit uh in one of the sessions yesterday a remark was made sessions yesterday a remark was made sessions yesterday a remark was made that made me have a little bit of a that made me have a little bit of a that made me have a little bit of a giggle to myself It's just a matter of giggle to myself It's just a matter of giggle to myself It's just a matter of getting the CNAs to do it right. Like getting the CNAs to do it right. Like getting the CNAs to do it right. Like that's a lot of cats to herd, isn't it? that's a lot of cats to herd, isn't it? that's a lot of cats to herd, isn't it? Right. And and an ever growing number of Right. And and an ever growing number of Right. And and an ever growing number of cats to try and heard to do it cats to try and heard to do it cats to try and heard to do it right. So between the the number of CNAs right. So between the the number of CNAs right. So between the the number of CNAs currently in existence and publishing currently in existence and publishing currently in existence and publishing CVES and this year-over-year growth in CVES and this year-over-year growth in CVES and this year-over-year growth in CNAs, it's it's not a straightforward CNAs, it's it's not a straightforward CNAs, it's it's not a straightforward undertaking. I get that. That that is a undertaking. I get that. That that is a undertaking. I get that. That that is a hard problem to try hard problem to try hard problem to try and put put back in the barn. and put put back in the barn. and put put back in the barn. One approach to address this is the the One approach to address this is the the One approach to address this is the the the CISA secure by design pledge. It's a the CISA secure by design pledge. It's a the CISA secure by design pledge. It's a good start. Definitely a good start and good start. Definitely a good start and good start. Definitely a good start and it may do a good enough job over time. it may do a good enough job over time. it may do a good enough job over time. It's only relatively young. The problem It's only relatively young. The problem It's only relatively young. The problem with this approach is it's entirely with this approach is it's entirely with this approach is it's entirely voluntary. And today it's very very voluntary. And today it's very very voluntary. And today it's very very specific and prescriptive about what specific and prescriptive about what specific and prescriptive about what what it what it entails. And I think what it what it entails. And I think what it what it entails. And I think that by complying with the pledge as that by complying with the pledge as that by complying with the pledge as it's currently specified, it may be it's currently specified, it may be it's currently specified, it may be inadequate for achieving machine inadequate for achieving machine inadequate for achieving machine readable detection and machine readable readable detection and machine readable readable detection and machine readable prioritization because it's emphasizing prioritization because it's emphasizing prioritization because it's emphasizing the implementation detail of CPE in the implementation detail of CPE in the implementation detail of CPE in particular rather than enabling the particular rather than enabling the particular rather than enabling the desired outcome. Now obviously remember desired outcome. Now obviously remember desired outcome. Now obviously remember I'm coming from an open- I'm coming from an open- I'm coming from an open- source sort of angle. So CPEs might be source sort of angle. So CPEs might be source sort of angle. So CPEs might be good enough for non-opensource good enough for non-opensource good enough for non-opensource um vulnerability management uh hardware um vulnerability management uh hardware um vulnerability management uh hardware appliance type stuff maybe. Um but but appliance type stuff maybe. Um but but appliance type stuff maybe. Um but but you know like for open source CP are you know like for open source CP are you know like for open source CP are problematic. Again Martin did a really problematic. Again Martin did a really problematic. Again Martin did a really good good job of sort of taking folks good good job of sort of taking folks good good job of sort of taking folks through that. So if you didn't attend through that. So if you didn't attend through that. So if you didn't attend his talk this morning highly recommend his talk this morning highly recommend his talk this morning highly recommend watching that when it comes up on watching that when it comes up on watching that when it comes up on YouTube. It's early days and based on my It's early days and based on my It's early days and based on my calculations, the set of pledge takers calculations, the set of pledge takers calculations, the set of pledge takers only covers 16% of the CVE list for only covers 16% of the CVE list for only covers 16% of the CVE list for 2024. So, it'll be interesting to see 2024. So, it'll be interesting to see 2024. So, it'll be interesting to see how that's trending by the end of how that's trending by the end of how that's trending by the end of 2025. And I was also reminded this week 2025. And I was also reminded this week 2025. And I was also reminded this week of the ERL, the enrichment recognition of the ERL, the enrichment recognition of the ERL, the enrichment recognition list, which is kind of the other side of list, which is kind of the other side of list, which is kind of the other side of what is essentially the the the same what is essentially the the the same what is essentially the the the same outcomes as the CISA pledge. outcomes as the CISA pledge. outcomes as the CISA pledge. It's some nice positive reinforcement of It's some nice positive reinforcement of It's some nice positive reinforcement of something that is is is a voluntary something that is is is a voluntary something that is is is a voluntary activity, but I'm skeptical that any activity, but I'm skeptical that any activity, but I'm skeptical that any sea-level executive at any CNA sea-level executive at any CNA sea-level executive at any CNA organization is going to care one way or organization is going to care one way or organization is going to care one way or another, right? Like it's only going to another, right? Like it's only going to another, right? Like it's only going to matter matter matter if vendor if vendor if vendor customers make it matter, right? customers make it matter, right? customers make it matter, right? So, so it's it's it's nice. It's a nice So, so it's it's it's nice. It's a nice So, so it's it's it's nice. It's a nice sort of positive reinforcement, nice sort of positive reinforcement, nice sort of positive reinforcement, nice feedback loop, nice sort of report, if feedback loop, nice sort of report, if feedback loop, nice sort of report, if you will, of of how it's going, but but you will, of of how it's going, but but you will, of of how it's going, but but I I don't know that it's going to have I I don't know that it's going to have I I don't know that it's going to have the the necessary motivating factors the the necessary motivating factors the the necessary motivating factors that that that we need it to kind of that that that we need it to kind of that that that we need it to kind of have. Based on our experiences of with have. Based on our experiences of with have. Based on our experiences of with converting CVEs from the NVD and the converting CVEs from the NVD and the converting CVEs from the NVD and the observations the state of the CVE list, observations the state of the CVE list, observations the state of the CVE list, we were able to capitalize on OSV's we were able to capitalize on OSV's we were able to capitalize on OSV's relative y youth and the innate data relative y youth and the innate data relative y youth and the innate data quality of our existing data sources as quality of our existing data sources as quality of our existing data sources as the starting point. the starting point. the starting point. and we're in the more enviable position and we're in the more enviable position and we're in the more enviable position of seeking to prevent backsliding on of seeking to prevent backsliding on of seeking to prevent backsliding on that existing data quality rather than that existing data quality rather than that existing data quality rather than needing to remediate the behavior needing to remediate the behavior needing to remediate the behavior um of an order of magnitude more data um of an order of magnitude more data um of an order of magnitude more data providers as well as all of the new ones providers as well as all of the new ones providers as well as all of the new ones coming on board year over year. So so coming on board year over year. So so coming on board year over year. So so you know it's a it's a different problem you know it's a it's a different problem you know it's a it's a different problem space for us and the what what we've space for us and the what what we've space for us and the what what we've done for OSB.dev dev is we've defined done for OSB.dev dev is we've defined done for OSB.dev dev is we've defined what we consider to be the minimum what we consider to be the minimum what we consider to be the minimum properties of a high quality OSV record properties of a high quality OSV record properties of a high quality OSV record which will be required ultimately we which will be required ultimately we which will be required ultimately we will require that to successfully import will require that to successfully import will require that to successfully import a a a record and so broadly it needs to be record and so broadly it needs to be record and so broadly it needs to be valid precise and identifiable we've valid precise and identifiable we've valid precise and identifiable we've jammed every possible validation into jammed every possible validation into jammed every possible validation into the JSON schema for for for an OSV the JSON schema for for for an OSV the JSON schema for for for an OSV record so if it passes validation it's record so if it passes validation it's record so if it passes validation it's good this allows for record publishers good this allows for record publishers good this allows for record publishers to prevalidate to prevalidate to prevalidate the structural aspects of of a record the structural aspects of of a record the structural aspects of of a record prior to publication. Unfortunately, prior to publication. Unfortunately, prior to publication. Unfortunately, JSON schema validation can only do so JSON schema validation can only do so JSON schema validation can only do so much. It's totally possible to have a much. It's totally possible to have a much. It's totally possible to have a schema compliant but utterly nonsensical schema compliant but utterly nonsensical schema compliant but utterly nonsensical record. So, we're also working on a record. So, we're also working on a record. So, we're also working on a record llinter to enable deeper record llinter to enable deeper record llinter to enable deeper validation of a record. And that was validation of a record. And that was validation of a record. And that was inspired by CVE lint again by Martin who inspired by CVE lint again by Martin who inspired by CVE lint again by Martin who remind me Martin did you write that remind me Martin did you write that remind me Martin did you write that after we chatted at BonCon last year? I after we chatted at BonCon last year? I after we chatted at BonCon last year? I think you might have. Yeah, love it. And think you might have. Yeah, love it. And think you might have. Yeah, love it. And so yeah, I I was like inspired by that. so yeah, I I was like inspired by that. so yeah, I I was like inspired by that. Went cool, we need we need one of them Went cool, we need we need one of them Went cool, we need we need one of them for OSV as well. And and so that's for OSV as well. And and so that's for OSV as well. And and so that's that's sort of what the origin story for that's sort of what the origin story for that's sort of what the origin story for that. And that lives in the the GitHub that. And that lives in the the GitHub that. And that lives in the the GitHub repo for the schema if you want to look repo for the schema if you want to look repo for the schema if you want to look at my terrible code and contribute to at my terrible code and contribute to at my terrible code and contribute to it. A precise record has at publication time A precise record has at publication time A precise record has at publication time correctly ordered an existing versions correctly ordered an existing versions correctly ordered an existing versions and refers to something that verifiably and refers to something that verifiably and refers to something that verifiably exists. I've repeatedly heard this exists. I've repeatedly heard this exists. I've repeatedly heard this argument that if the CVE program makes argument that if the CVE program makes argument that if the CVE program makes it too ownorous for a CNA to create and it too ownorous for a CNA to create and it too ownorous for a CNA to create and submit a CVE that they'll simply refuse submit a CVE that they'll simply refuse submit a CVE that they'll simply refuse to to to participate. that there's this delicate, participate. that there's this delicate, participate. that there's this delicate, fragile, entirely voluntary arrangement fragile, entirely voluntary arrangement fragile, entirely voluntary arrangement in place that risks collapsing in a heap in place that risks collapsing in a heap in place that risks collapsing in a heap if we go and require too much of CNAs to if we go and require too much of CNAs to if we go and require too much of CNAs to submit a CVE in the first place. I'd submit a CVE in the first place. I'd submit a CVE in the first place. I'd like to strongly challenge this like to strongly challenge this like to strongly challenge this argument. I do think that there is a argument. I do think that there is a argument. I do think that there is a significant misalignment of incentives significant misalignment of incentives significant misalignment of incentives which contributes to some of the tension which contributes to some of the tension which contributes to some of the tension here and I'd like to explore that for a here and I'd like to explore that for a here and I'd like to explore that for a moment. On the supply moment. On the supply moment. On the supply side, CNAs, particularly ones who are side, CNAs, particularly ones who are side, CNAs, particularly ones who are product vendors, are dealing with product vendors, are dealing with product vendors, are dealing with product vulnerabilities as part of their product vulnerabilities as part of their product vulnerabilities as part of their product or software development life product or software development life product or software development life cycle. They're doing that on an cycle. They're doing that on an cycle. They're doing that on an individual basis. And when you're individual basis. And when you're individual basis. And when you're dealing with a CVE on an individual dealing with a CVE on an individual dealing with a CVE on an individual basis, it's entirely understandable to basis, it's entirely understandable to basis, it's entirely understandable to focus on the parts that are human focus on the parts that are human focus on the parts that are human oriented in particular that description. oriented in particular that description. oriented in particular that description. I get it. Not saying we shouldn't do I get it. Not saying we shouldn't do I get it. Not saying we shouldn't do that. We do. Well, so we have these that. We do. Well, so we have these that. We do. Well, so we have these CVES. We're beautiful. sometimes not CVES. We're beautiful. sometimes not CVES. We're beautiful. sometimes not human readable descriptions of the human readable descriptions of the human readable descriptions of the vulnerability, the version it was vulnerability, the version it was vulnerability, the version it was introduced in, the version it was fixed introduced in, the version it was fixed introduced in, the version it was fixed in, and all the things that the defender in, and all the things that the defender in, and all the things that the defender needs to know if they're looking at that needs to know if they're looking at that needs to know if they're looking at that CVE in isolation. The problem is they're CVE in isolation. The problem is they're CVE in isolation. The problem is they're not. They're looking at this CVE along not. They're looking at this CVE along not. They're looking at this CVE along with all the other ones that are with all the other ones that are with all the other ones that are flooding in. They need to know which flooding in. They need to know which flooding in. They need to know which ones apply to them, which ones need to ones apply to them, which ones need to ones apply to them, which ones need to be patched first or sooner than a normal be patched first or sooner than a normal be patched first or sooner than a normal patch cycle. and they may be a link in patch cycle. and they may be a link in patch cycle. and they may be a link in the chain the chain the chain themselves. So it becomes a turtles all themselves. So it becomes a turtles all themselves. So it becomes a turtles all the way down sort of scenario. So I want to go a little bit scenario. So I want to go a little bit scenario. So I want to go a little bit deeper on a few of these external deeper on a few of these external deeper on a few of these external pressures. I'm of the opinion that the pressures. I'm of the opinion that the pressures. I'm of the opinion that the external pressures between government external pressures between government external pressures between government compliance and private customer compliance and private customer compliance and private customer contractual contractual contractual obligations and external vulnerability obligations and external vulnerability obligations and external vulnerability researchers kicking up a stink if they researchers kicking up a stink if they researchers kicking up a stink if they don't get the CVE issued for their don't get the CVE issued for their don't get the CVE issued for their vulnerability discoveries and peer vulnerability discoveries and peer vulnerability discoveries and peer pressure from within the CVE program pressure from within the CVE program pressure from within the CVE program will make it untenable for a product will make it untenable for a product will make it untenable for a product vendor to stop participating. vendor to stop participating. vendor to stop participating. I also think there's a really good I also think there's a really good I also think there's a really good opportunity to more broadly encourage opportunity to more broadly encourage opportunity to more broadly encourage commercial product purchasing decisions commercial product purchasing decisions commercial product purchasing decisions to include the track record of a to include the track record of a to include the track record of a product's vulnerability management. product's vulnerability management. product's vulnerability management. Right? Like like I think we've Right? Like like I think we've Right? Like like I think we've fortunately got past the the the idea of fortunately got past the the the idea of fortunately got past the the the idea of CVE being used as a mark of shame and CVE being used as a mark of shame and CVE being used as a mark of shame and more as evidence of a mature more as evidence of a mature more as evidence of a mature vulnerability life cycle management sort vulnerability life cycle management sort vulnerability life cycle management sort of story for a product. So, you know, I of story for a product. So, you know, I of story for a product. So, you know, I don't think that we we should be don't think that we we should be don't think that we we should be regressing back to that as the metric of regressing back to that as the metric of regressing back to that as the metric of of of sales conversations, but I think of of sales conversations, but I think of of sales conversations, but I think if if if um you have a story around how easy you um you have a story around how easy you um you have a story around how easy you are making your customers vulnerability are making your customers vulnerability are making your customers vulnerability management story by having high quality management story by having high quality management story by having high quality CV records that that can be a point of CV records that that can be a point of CV records that that can be a point of differentiation between competing differentiation between competing differentiation between competing vendors. So, so I would rather say vendors. So, so I would rather say vendors. So, so I would rather say rather than don't participate, be an rather than don't participate, be an rather than don't participate, be an exemplar and then use that as a point of exemplar and then use that as a point of exemplar and then use that as a point of competition. I feel very strongly, if competition. I feel very strongly, if competition. I feel very strongly, if you haven't noticed, that the very the you haven't noticed, that the very the you haven't noticed, that the very the urgently necessary evolution of the CV urgently necessary evolution of the CV urgently necessary evolution of the CV programs fitness for purpose should not programs fitness for purpose should not programs fitness for purpose should not be held hostage by CNAs that wish to be held hostage by CNAs that wish to be held hostage by CNAs that wish to threaten to vote with their feet. It threaten to vote with their feet. It threaten to vote with their feet. It would make for an interesting case study would make for an interesting case study would make for an interesting case study to observe the market effects of a to observe the market effects of a to observe the market effects of a vendor CNA electing to take that action. The other one is a more interesting take The other one is a more interesting take The other one is a more interesting take on the whole product vulnerability on the whole product vulnerability on the whole product vulnerability management approach that I've seen more management approach that I've seen more management approach that I've seen more in the the open- source space. It boils in the the open- source space. It boils in the the open- source space. It boils down to rather simplistically to saying down to rather simplistically to saying down to rather simplistically to saying that all software that all software that all software has inherent and potentially unknown has inherent and potentially unknown has inherent and potentially unknown security vulnerabilities and if there's security vulnerabilities and if there's security vulnerabilities and if there's a newer version for the thing available a newer version for the thing available a newer version for the thing available then you should just upgrade to it as then you should just upgrade to it as then you should just upgrade to it as soon as possible. So two examples of soon as possible. So two examples of soon as possible. So two examples of this philosophy with somewhat different this philosophy with somewhat different this philosophy with somewhat different approaches to it are Chromium and the approaches to it are Chromium and the approaches to it are Chromium and the Linux kernel, right? Like like the Linux Linux kernel, right? Like like the Linux Linux kernel, right? Like like the Linux kernel has unabashedly said, "We don't kernel has unabashedly said, "We don't kernel has unabashedly said, "We don't know whether this is actually going to know whether this is actually going to know whether this is actually going to affect you or not, but we're going to affect you or not, but we're going to affect you or not, but we're going to assume that it does have security assume that it does have security assume that it does have security ramifications. Here's a CVE." And then ramifications. Here's a CVE." And then ramifications. Here's a CVE." And then we're all like, "Holy crap, CBS." we're all like, "Holy crap, CBS." we're all like, "Holy crap, CBS." Whereas Chrome, Chromium, Chrome has Whereas Chrome, Chromium, Chrome has Whereas Chrome, Chromium, Chrome has come and said, "Every every update we come and said, "Every every update we come and said, "Every every update we make, you should assume has some make, you should assume has some make, you should assume has some security vulnerabilities. security vulnerabilities. security vulnerabilities. And therefore you should always upgrade And therefore you should always upgrade And therefore you should always upgrade like like that. Their philosophy is like like that. Their philosophy is like like that. Their philosophy is trying to do vulnerability management is trying to do vulnerability management is trying to do vulnerability management is the fool's errand just upgrade. the fool's errand just upgrade. the fool's errand just upgrade. Now restarting your browser and Now restarting your browser and Now restarting your browser and rebooting your your Linux kernel running rebooting your your Linux kernel running rebooting your your Linux kernel running infrastructure. Although I guess we've infrastructure. Although I guess we've infrastructure. Although I guess we've got hot hot hot updates and stuff like got hot hot hot updates and stuff like got hot hot hot updates and stuff like that these days. So maybe it's not such that these days. So maybe it's not such that these days. So maybe it's not such a big deal as it used to be. I haven't a big deal as it used to be. I haven't a big deal as it used to be. I haven't had to sis them in my Linux box in anger had to sis them in my Linux box in anger had to sis them in my Linux box in anger for a while. Thank god. Um so but yeah for a while. Thank god. Um so but yeah for a while. Thank god. Um so but yeah those those are two very different those those are two very different those those are two very different approaches. approaches. approaches. So that's some of that misalignment of So that's some of that misalignment of So that's some of that misalignment of incentives. If we look at the basic life incentives. If we look at the basic life incentives. If we look at the basic life cycle of vulnerability disclosure from cycle of vulnerability disclosure from cycle of vulnerability disclosure from discovery through to CVE publication discovery through to CVE publication discovery through to CVE publication ideally in conjunction with a fix being ideally in conjunction with a fix being ideally in conjunction with a fix being released we have a few different released we have a few different released we have a few different personas involved. I like sort of taking personas involved. I like sort of taking personas involved. I like sort of taking the the persona sort of product sort of the the persona sort of product sort of the the persona sort of product sort of mentality. So, we've got Faith the mentality. So, we've got Faith the mentality. So, we've got Faith the finder, Kathy the CNA operator, Veronica finder, Kathy the CNA operator, Veronica finder, Kathy the CNA operator, Veronica the vulnerability subject owner, and the vulnerability subject owner, and the vulnerability subject owner, and Lucky the vulnerability impacted user. And then, as I said, we've got a user. And then, as I said, we've got a user. And then, as I said, we've got a bunch of different types of CNAs. I'm bunch of different types of CNAs. I'm bunch of different types of CNAs. I'm I'm going to focus on just a subset I'm going to focus on just a subset I'm going to focus on just a subset today. I'll focus on vendor, open today. I'll focus on vendor, open today. I'll focus on vendor, open source, researcher, and bug bounty source, researcher, and bug bounty source, researcher, and bug bounty provider. These contributed to about 80% provider. These contributed to about 80% provider. These contributed to about 80% of the CVES in 2024. So, you know, of the CVES in 2024. So, you know, of the CVES in 2024. So, you know, rather than pratt on for all the other rather than pratt on for all the other rather than pratt on for all the other more niche ones, we'll just focus on more niche ones, we'll just focus on more niche ones, we'll just focus on those four. So, let's start with vendor CNAs four. So, let's start with vendor CNAs four. So, let's start with vendor CNAs because that's by far the um the lion because that's by far the um the lion because that's by far the um the lion share of contributing CNAs to 2024's share of contributing CNAs to 2024's share of contributing CNAs to 2024's CVs. In the case of a vendor CNA, CVs. In the case of a vendor CNA, CVs. In the case of a vendor CNA, they've got the best opportunity for they've got the best opportunity for they've got the best opportunity for high quality communication when Faith high quality communication when Faith high quality communication when Faith the finder is in the finder is in the finder is in house. Faith could also be an external house. Faith could also be an external house. Faith could also be an external vulnerability researcher or reporter. vulnerability researcher or reporter. vulnerability researcher or reporter. Importantly, the CNA CNA function has Importantly, the CNA CNA function has Importantly, the CNA CNA function has the greatest chance of highfidelity the greatest chance of highfidelity the greatest chance of highfidelity communication with the owner of the communication with the owner of the communication with the owner of the thing that is vulnerable because they're thing that is vulnerable because they're thing that is vulnerable because they're all in house. you can walk down the all in house. you can walk down the all in house. you can walk down the hallway, you can jump on a on a team's hallway, you can jump on a on a team's hallway, you can jump on a on a team's call or Google meet or whatever and and call or Google meet or whatever and and call or Google meet or whatever and and have a chat. So, you'd expect CVE issued have a chat. So, you'd expect CVE issued have a chat. So, you'd expect CVE issued by product vendors to have the easiest by product vendors to have the easiest by product vendors to have the easiest time including the sort of information time including the sort of information time including the sort of information needed for a high quality actionable CVE needed for a high quality actionable CVE needed for a high quality actionable CVE record. Now, if we look at the various record. Now, if we look at the various record. Now, if we look at the various outcomes that the parties are outcomes that the parties are outcomes that the parties are incentivized for, our vulnerability incentivized for, our vulnerability incentivized for, our vulnerability finder faith, particularly the external finder faith, particularly the external finder faith, particularly the external one wants the CVE ID. They want it for one wants the CVE ID. They want it for one wants the CVE ID. They want it for for credit, they want it for their for credit, they want it for their for credit, they want it for their resume, they want bragging rights, resume, they want bragging rights, resume, they want bragging rights, whatever. our vendor. They just want whatever. our vendor. They just want whatever. our vendor. They just want everyone to stop bothering them. They everyone to stop bothering them. They everyone to stop bothering them. They want to meet their regulatory and want to meet their regulatory and want to meet their regulatory and contractual obligations around contractual obligations around contractual obligations around disclosure for which the existence of disclosure for which the existence of disclosure for which the existence of potentially an incredibly basic 1999 potentially an incredibly basic 1999 potentially an incredibly basic 1999 style CDE may be sufficient to tick that style CDE may be sufficient to tick that style CDE may be sufficient to tick that box. It certainly is for CD record box. It certainly is for CD record box. It certainly is for CD record publication. As I just said, they also publication. As I just said, they also publication. As I just said, they also want their customers not to give them want their customers not to give them want their customers not to give them grief about known vulnerabilities in grief about known vulnerabilities in grief about known vulnerabilities in their products. A false negative is way their products. A false negative is way their products. A false negative is way more attractive to a vendor than a false more attractive to a vendor than a false more attractive to a vendor than a false positive at least until their customers positive at least until their customers positive at least until their customers get owned as a result of it. Right? So get owned as a result of it. Right? So get owned as a result of it. Right? So the customer wants to make sure that the customer wants to make sure that the customer wants to make sure that they don't get owned and they're meeting they don't get owned and they're meeting they don't get owned and they're meeting their own regulatory and contractual their own regulatory and contractual their own regulatory and contractual compliance obligations around known compliance obligations around known compliance obligations around known vulnerabilities. And as I said before, vulnerabilities. And as I said before, vulnerabilities. And as I said before, sometimes this there's multiple hops in sometimes this there's multiple hops in sometimes this there's multiple hops in this this this this this this this this this chain. False positives are annoying. chain. False positives are annoying. chain. False positives are annoying. False negatives are a concern as well. False negatives are a concern as well. False negatives are a concern as well. the the customer wants to know their the the customer wants to know their the the customer wants to know their true exposure and they want to know what true exposure and they want to know what true exposure and they want to know what to do about it and how to do about it and how to do about it and how urgently. Open source CNAs are somewhat urgently. Open source CNAs are somewhat urgently. Open source CNAs are somewhat similar. Um, in many, if not most cases, similar. Um, in many, if not most cases, similar. Um, in many, if not most cases, they walk and talk like a vendor. In they walk and talk like a vendor. In they walk and talk like a vendor. In fact, a lot of the CNAs that are open fact, a lot of the CNAs that are open fact, a lot of the CNAs that are open source are often, but not always, also source are often, but not always, also source are often, but not always, also vendors. I think there's some vendors. I think there's some vendors. I think there's some inconsistencies in the CNA metadata for inconsistencies in the CNA metadata for inconsistencies in the CNA metadata for situations where they're not. situations where they're not. situations where they're not. So you've got potentially the same So you've got potentially the same So you've got potentially the same expected high fidelity because the CNA expected high fidelity because the CNA expected high fidelity because the CNA issuing the CVE has the greatest chance issuing the CVE has the greatest chance issuing the CVE has the greatest chance of having context on the details for the of having context on the details for the of having context on the details for the fix for it. Whoops. They have the fix for it. Whoops. They have the fix for it. Whoops. They have the potential to get interesting with things potential to get interesting with things potential to get interesting with things like Linux distributions. There's a bit like Linux distributions. There's a bit like Linux distributions. There's a bit of talk about that uh particularly in of talk about that uh particularly in of talk about that uh particularly in the context of Red Hat um earlier in the the context of Red Hat um earlier in the the context of Red Hat um earlier in the week where they're week where they're week where they're redistributing vulnerable open source redistributing vulnerable open source redistributing vulnerable open source software. So for example, a Linux software. So for example, a Linux software. So for example, a Linux distribution with its own package of curl. Things that had the potential to curl. Things that had the potential to curl. Things that had the potential to be interesting with Linux be interesting with Linux be interesting with Linux distributions. Um yeah, sorry. Um my distributions. Um yeah, sorry. Um my distributions. Um yeah, sorry. Um my understanding of the CNA understanding of the CNA understanding of the CNA rules are that it is rather complicated rules are that it is rather complicated rules are that it is rather complicated and nuanced as to when, where, and which and nuanced as to when, where, and which and nuanced as to when, where, and which CNA should not should or should not be CNA should not should or should not be CNA should not should or should not be issuing CVEes under those circumstances. issuing CVEes under those circumstances. issuing CVEes under those circumstances. And I can also appreciate that the way And I can also appreciate that the way And I can also appreciate that the way that things are currently operating, that things are currently operating, that things are currently operating, it's also challenging it's also challenging it's also challenging for an impacted vendor to be able to for an impacted vendor to be able to for an impacted vendor to be able to make an appropriate statement about one make an appropriate statement about one make an appropriate statement about one of these open source related CVES when of these open source related CVES when of these open source related CVES when it's under the ownership of a different it's under the ownership of a different it's under the ownership of a different CNA. CNA. CNA. It would be an interesting case study It would be an interesting case study It would be an interesting case study and maybe a future Vongorn or open and maybe a future Vongorn or open and maybe a future Vongorn or open source summit presentation to look at source summit presentation to look at source summit presentation to look at the reality versus the interpretation of the reality versus the interpretation of the reality versus the interpretation of these rules in particular for a set of these rules in particular for a set of these rules in particular for a set of CVEs relating to open source CVEs relating to open source CVEs relating to open source software. Now we get to the more complex software. Now we get to the more complex software. Now we get to the more complex cases starting with the be the bug cases starting with the be the bug cases starting with the be the bug bounty bounty bounty providers. Bug bounty providers are providers. Bug bounty providers are providers. Bug bounty providers are operating at arms length from everyone operating at arms length from everyone operating at arms length from everyone else involved in the CVE transaction. else involved in the CVE transaction. else involved in the CVE transaction. They're paying the finder and issuing a They're paying the finder and issuing a They're paying the finder and issuing a CVE, typically based on what the finder CVE, typically based on what the finder CVE, typically based on what the finder has provided about the vulnerability, has provided about the vulnerability, has provided about the vulnerability, perhaps enhanced by their own perhaps enhanced by their own perhaps enhanced by their own understanding of the vulnerability as understanding of the vulnerability as understanding of the vulnerability as part of paying for it. This lack of part of paying for it. This lack of part of paying for it. This lack of context on fixed information and needing context on fixed information and needing context on fixed information and needing to potentially act as an intermediary to potentially act as an intermediary to potentially act as an intermediary between the finder and the fixer means between the finder and the fixer means between the finder and the fixer means that these CVE are much less likely to that these CVE are much less likely to that these CVE are much less likely to be initially published with fixed be initially published with fixed be initially published with fixed information and are reliant on the information and are reliant on the information and are reliant on the vulnerability subject owner Veronica vulnerability subject owner Veronica vulnerability subject owner Veronica liazing with the bug bounty provider to liazing with the bug bounty provider to liazing with the bug bounty provider to ensure fixed information winds up on the ensure fixed information winds up on the ensure fixed information winds up on the CVE record. This added friction creates CVE record. This added friction creates CVE record. This added friction creates a barrier to higher quality CVE records a barrier to higher quality CVE records a barrier to higher quality CVE records particularly in a timely manner. particularly in a timely manner. particularly in a timely manner. There's a lot more friction from the There's a lot more friction from the There's a lot more friction from the coordination overheads here and less coordination overheads here and less coordination overheads here and less alignment around the incentives of the alignment around the incentives of the alignment around the incentives of the finder and the end consumer. Finder finder and the end consumer. Finder finder and the end consumer. Finder doesn't care. Finder just wants the doesn't care. Finder just wants the doesn't care. Finder just wants the glory. The other complex case is the glory. The other complex case is the glory. The other complex case is the researcher CNA. There's a lot more of researcher CNA. There's a lot more of researcher CNA. There's a lot more of these types of CNAs, but they also these types of CNAs, but they also these types of CNAs, but they also overlap with either bug bounty providers overlap with either bug bounty providers overlap with either bug bounty providers or product vendors. So there's some or product vendors. So there's some or product vendors. So there's some really blurry lines around what CVE get really blurry lines around what CVE get really blurry lines around what CVE get issued under the all spices of research issued under the all spices of research issued under the all spices of research and what the subject of the research is. and what the subject of the research is. and what the subject of the research is. The same problem around high quality fix The same problem around high quality fix The same problem around high quality fix information applies as with bug bounty information applies as with bug bounty information applies as with bug bounty providers and the same added providers and the same added providers and the same added coordination coordination coordination overheads. We've got, you know, I I love overheads. We've got, you know, I I love overheads. We've got, you know, I I love I love reading the the CV the CNA I love reading the the CV the CNA I love reading the the CV the CNA scopes. We get into this whole CNA scope scopes. We get into this whole CNA scope scopes. We get into this whole CNA scope thing. As far as I can tell, there is no thing. As far as I can tell, there is no thing. As far as I can tell, there is no programmatically no programmatic way to programmatically no programmatic way to programmatically no programmatic way to validate whether a CVE is legitimately validate whether a CVE is legitimately validate whether a CVE is legitimately within a CNA scope or not. and the within a CNA scope or not. and the within a CNA scope or not. and the enforcement of a CNA scope I believe is enforcement of a CNA scope I believe is enforcement of a CNA scope I believe is largely based on the honor system. Uh if largely based on the honor system. Uh if largely based on the honor system. Uh if vendor CNA growth continues as it has vendor CNA growth continues as it has vendor CNA growth continues as it has been I can see a downward trend in CVE been I can see a downward trend in CVE been I can see a downward trend in CVE reported by bug bounty and researcher reported by bug bounty and researcher reported by bug bounty and researcher CNAs over time. I I didn't run the CNAs over time. I I didn't run the CNAs over time. I I didn't run the numbers on that to sort of see if numbers on that to sort of see if numbers on that to sort of see if there's like inversely proportional there's like inversely proportional there's like inversely proportional number of CVEs being uh originated by number of CVEs being uh originated by number of CVEs being uh originated by them as as vendors pop up to sort of be them as as vendors pop up to sort of be them as as vendors pop up to sort of be the first point of call for them. So here here's my thoughts on some So here here's my thoughts on some So here here's my thoughts on some concrete steps forward. Firstly, make it concrete steps forward. Firstly, make it concrete steps forward. Firstly, make it abundantly clear what the program's abundantly clear what the program's abundantly clear what the program's mission statement means in 2025 and into mission statement means in 2025 and into mission statement means in 2025 and into the next 25 years. 25 years is a lovely the next 25 years. 25 years is a lovely the next 25 years. 25 years is a lovely nice round quarter of a century. What nice round quarter of a century. What nice round quarter of a century. What got you here won't get you there. Let's got you here won't get you there. Let's got you here won't get you there. Let's let's sort of re you know don't change let's sort of re you know don't change let's sort of re you know don't change the mission statement. Just clarify how the mission statement. Just clarify how the mission statement. Just clarify how to interpret that 25 years later. Set a to interpret that 25 years later. Set a to interpret that 25 years later. Set a target for the desired standard of target for the desired standard of target for the desired standard of capability from a CVE record. Then capability from a CVE record. Then capability from a CVE record. Then incrementally start bringing program incrementally start bringing program incrementally start bringing program participants up to this standard. Make participants up to this standard. Make participants up to this standard. Make the JSON schema enforce this standard. the JSON schema enforce this standard. the JSON schema enforce this standard. Given the CVE program's primary metric Given the CVE program's primary metric Given the CVE program's primary metric of interest has historically been CNA of interest has historically been CNA of interest has historically been CNA growth. I'm not suggesting that it stop growth. I'm not suggesting that it stop growth. I'm not suggesting that it stop simply to have a flag day where new CNAs simply to have a flag day where new CNAs simply to have a flag day where new CNAs are held to a higher standard from the are held to a higher standard from the are held to a higher standard from the from the outset. from the outset. from the outset. Then there comes the effort of bringing Then there comes the effort of bringing Then there comes the effort of bringing all the existing CNAs up to this new all the existing CNAs up to this new all the existing CNAs up to this new more stringent standard. I think the top more stringent standard. I think the top more stringent standard. I think the top 15 CNAs is a manageable number of cats 15 CNAs is a manageable number of cats 15 CNAs is a manageable number of cats to heard in the first instance rather to heard in the first instance rather to heard in the first instance rather than 400 plus. These CNAs as the than 400 plus. These CNAs as the than 400 plus. These CNAs as the underpinning of the C CVE list by underpinning of the C CVE list by underpinning of the C CVE list by volume can individually affect the volume can individually affect the volume can individually affect the greatest quality bang for greatest quality bang for greatest quality bang for buck in any given year and serve as buck in any given year and serve as buck in any given year and serve as models of the desired behavior. models of the desired behavior. models of the desired behavior. It's especially important that the It's especially important that the It's especially important that the CNARS be models of that behavior that we CNARS be models of that behavior that we CNARS be models of that behavior that we want voluntary CNAs to adhere want voluntary CNAs to adhere want voluntary CNAs to adhere to. So I'm proposing that the CV program to. So I'm proposing that the CV program to. So I'm proposing that the CV program take a use case-based approach first take a use case-based approach first take a use case-based approach first conceived on the back of a napkin at conceived on the back of a napkin at conceived on the back of a napkin at Voncon last year and progre and and to Voncon last year and progre and and to Voncon last year and progre and and to progressively ensure that all CVEes can progressively ensure that all CVEes can progressively ensure that all CVEes can meet these three basic use cases. meet these three basic use cases. meet these three basic use cases. Firstly, detection, automatable Firstly, detection, automatable Firstly, detection, automatable detection, accurate affected product detection, accurate affected product detection, accurate affected product information, CPEs, pearls, all the information, CPEs, pearls, all the information, CPEs, pearls, all the things and then enable remediation, things and then enable remediation, things and then enable remediation, prioritization, and prioritization, and prioritization, and then secondary prioritization in the and then secondary prioritization in the and then secondary prioritization in the and retrospective analysis. So, you see CWES, this is going to take some strong CWES, this is going to take some strong CWES, this is going to take some strong leadership. leadership. leadership. There's going to be some push back. There's going to be some push back. There's going to be some push back. There's going to be some There's going to be some There's going to be some feelings. It's going to require some feelings. It's going to require some feelings. It's going to require some selling. SISA is paying for this thing. selling. SISA is paying for this thing. selling. SISA is paying for this thing. They ultimately have a lot of power to They ultimately have a lot of power to They ultimately have a lot of power to attach some conditions on that attach some conditions on that attach some conditions on that funding. The CVE board stops with funding. The CVE board stops with funding. The CVE board stops with you as the program's governing you as the program's governing you as the program's governing body and CNAs and CN CNA LRs need to body and CNAs and CN CNA LRs need to body and CNAs and CN CNA LRs need to sign up to doing a better sign up to doing a better sign up to doing a better job. When you're dealing with a job. When you're dealing with a job. When you're dealing with a vulnerability researcher or some third vulnerability researcher or some third vulnerability researcher or some third party that's requesting a CVE from you, party that's requesting a CVE from you, party that's requesting a CVE from you, you have their you have their you have their attention. They want what you're given. Make sure you're getting what you want Make sure you're getting what you want Make sure you're getting what you want from them before you give it to them. from them before you give it to them. from them before you give it to them. Make them jump through the flaming Make them jump through the flaming Make them jump through the flaming hoops because once you've given them hoops because once you've given them hoops because once you've given them that thing, they're going to go that thing, they're going to go that thing, they're going to go away. And then the downstream consumers away. And then the downstream consumers away. And then the downstream consumers have a lot of opportunities here to be a have a lot of opportunities here to be a have a lot of opportunities here to be a little bit more sophisticated about what little bit more sophisticated about what little bit more sophisticated about what they're they're both as I said, add this they're they're both as I said, add this they're they're both as I said, add this into your vendor selection process. into your vendor selection process. into your vendor selection process. Demand more of your vendors. Have some Demand more of your vendors. Have some Demand more of your vendors. Have some awkward conversations when there's awkward conversations when there's awkward conversations when there's contract renewals. contract renewals. contract renewals. compare and contrast vendors. Like it'd compare and contrast vendors. Like it'd compare and contrast vendors. Like it'd be cool to have some visualizations be cool to have some visualizations be cool to have some visualizations around let's get competitive. Let's around let's get competitive. Let's around let's get competitive. Let's let's not make it a race to the bottom. let's not make it a race to the bottom. let's not make it a race to the bottom. Let's make it a race to the best, right? Let's make it a race to the best, right? Let's make it a race to the best, right? I I'd like to see some some ch, you I I'd like to see some some ch, you I I'd like to see some some ch, you know, some challenges done about which know, some challenges done about which know, some challenges done about which vendors are kicking butt and taking vendors are kicking butt and taking vendors are kicking butt and taking names in in in the same markets so that names in in in the same markets so that names in in in the same markets so that so that yeah, it becomes a bit of so that yeah, it becomes a bit of so that yeah, it becomes a bit of friendly competitive rivalry in that friendly competitive rivalry in that friendly competitive rivalry in that regard. regard. regard. And for vulnerability researchers, I And for vulnerability researchers, I And for vulnerability researchers, I know you don't necessarily care about know you don't necessarily care about know you don't necessarily care about the poor end users that are impacted, the poor end users that are impacted, the poor end users that are impacted, but but ideally if you're if you're but but ideally if you're if you're but but ideally if you're if you're doing this in an ethical hacking CVE doing this in an ethical hacking CVE doing this in an ethical hacking CVE responsible vulnerability uh responsible responsible vulnerability uh responsible responsible vulnerability uh responsible disclosure kind of way, maybe you do, disclosure kind of way, maybe you do, disclosure kind of way, maybe you do, right? So, make sure that the CNA that's right? So, make sure that the CNA that's right? So, make sure that the CNA that's issuing that CVE for you is doing a full issuing that CVE for you is doing a full issuing that CVE for you is doing a full endto-end sort of story for it and that endto-end sort of story for it and that endto-end sort of story for it and that the fix information is in there so that the fix information is in there so that the fix information is in there so that the people that are impacted by the the people that are impacted by the the people that are impacted by the thing that you're getting all the fame thing that you're getting all the fame thing that you're getting all the fame for is is is trivially for is is is trivially for is is is trivially fixable. Help them do better as fixable. Help them do better as fixable. Help them do better as well. How quickly can we do this? Can we well. How quickly can we do this? Can we well. How quickly can we do this? Can we make some make some make some tangible durable tangible durable tangible durable improvements? CV programs 25. It's a big improvements? CV programs 25. It's a big improvements? CV programs 25. It's a big milestone. Only 9 years ago was that milestone. Only 9 years ago was that milestone. Only 9 years ago was that first major turning point with first major turning point with first major turning point with Federation. The initial machine readable Federation. The initial machine readable Federation. The initial machine readable record improvements are only 7 years record improvements are only 7 years record improvements are only 7 years old. Can we turn things around by the old. Can we turn things around by the old. Can we turn things around by the end of the decade? I dare you. I end of the decade? I dare you. I end of the decade? I dare you. I challenge you. challenge you. challenge you. I'd like to think that with a will I'd like to think that with a will I'd like to think that with a will there's a way. It's just going to there's a way. It's just going to there's a way. It's just going to require the key players to all pull in require the key players to all pull in require the key players to all pull in the same direction with a sense of the same direction with a sense of the same direction with a sense of urgency. Thank you for coming to my TED urgency. Thank you for coming to my TED urgency. Thank you for coming to my TED talk. Andrew, thank you so much. An Andrew, thank you so much. An Andrew, thank you so much. An interesting challenge here at the Von interesting challenge here at the Von interesting challenge here at the Von office uh at the Von conference. I have office uh at the Von conference. I have office uh at the Von conference. I have a couple questions in uh Discord. I'll a couple questions in uh Discord. I'll a couple questions in uh Discord. I'll do one first and then I'll alternate do one first and then I'll alternate do one first and then I'll alternate here in the room and go back to Discord here in the room and go back to Discord here in the room and go back to Discord after each person. Uh, and I strongly after each person. Uh, and I strongly after each person. Uh, and I strongly recommend Andrew, you take a look at the recommend Andrew, you take a look at the recommend Andrew, you take a look at the Discord. There's been some great Discord. There's been some great Discord. There's been some great comments and conversation going on. comments and conversation going on. comments and conversation going on. Awesome. I will. Our uh first question Awesome. I will. Our uh first question Awesome. I will. Our uh first question from the from the from the interwebs. OSV has just over uh 82,000 interwebs. OSV has just over uh 82,000 interwebs. OSV has just over uh 82,000 vols uh 56k to 9,000 or so. Um, the vols uh 56k to 9,000 or so. Um, the vols uh 56k to 9,000 or so. Um, the slide went away. Is that to say that you slide went away. Is that to say that you slide went away. Is that to say that you have 12 to 15,000 distinct have 12 to 15,000 distinct have 12 to 15,000 distinct vulnerabilities without a CVE ID? Where is it? It was early on. I got it Where is it? It was early on. I got it Where is it? It was early on. I got it here. here. here. Right. That one. So the question is of Right. That one. So the question is of Right. That one. So the question is of that delta between 82,000 83,000 and and that delta between 82,000 83,000 and and that delta between 82,000 83,000 and and 58 and a half thousand are 58 and a half thousand are 58 and a half thousand are they they they potentially not are they bespoke potentially not are they bespoke potentially not are they bespoke vulnerabilities yet to have been CVE vulnerabilities yet to have been CVE vulnerabilities yet to have been CVE issued? I haven't looked at them. I issued? I haven't looked at them. I issued? I haven't looked at them. I can't say can't say can't say um I don't know. Could be worth a look. um I don't know. Could be worth a look. um I don't know. Could be worth a look. Could be an interesting talk next year. Could be an interesting talk next year. Could be an interesting talk next year. an interesting talk. Could be an an interesting talk. Could be an an interesting talk. Could be an interesting uh vulnerability research uh interesting uh vulnerability research uh interesting uh vulnerability research uh fertile uh exploration zone. So, and I fertile uh exploration zone. So, and I fertile uh exploration zone. So, and I expect you and Jericho will be talking expect you and Jericho will be talking expect you and Jericho will be talking more about this. So, I saw a question more about this. So, I saw a question more about this. So, I saw a question with Bruce and then Martin and I'll with Bruce and then Martin and I'll with Bruce and then Martin and I'll bounce back in between the two to bounce back in between the two to bounce back in between the two to another Discord question. another Discord question. another Discord question. My question was actually on this exact My question was actually on this exact My question was actually on this exact same slide. What's the difference same slide. What's the difference same slide. What's the difference between the OSV numbers and the CVE between the OSV numbers and the CVE between the OSV numbers and the CVE numbers? And please enlighten me on numbers? And please enlighten me on numbers? And please enlighten me on that. that. that. What's the difference? What's the difference? What's the difference? Why are the numbers different? Why are the numbers different? Why are the numbers different? Yeah, I guess I should have dug into Yeah, I guess I should have dug into Yeah, I guess I should have dug into that more and preempted that that that that more and preempted that that that that more and preempted that that that question, right? question, right? question, right? Uh we have Uh we have Uh we have uh there's a little bit of overlap. So uh there's a little bit of overlap. So uh there's a little bit of overlap. So the GitHub advisory database is our largest I should pull up the actual I largest I should pull up the actual I largest I should pull up the actual I was.dev website where there's aggregate was.dev website where there's aggregate was.dev website where there's aggregate numbers. Which one you It sounds like numbers. Which one you It sounds like numbers. Which one you It sounds like you might have it. Oh, Art, do you? No. you might have it. Oh, Art, do you? No. you might have it. Oh, Art, do you? No. No. No. No. You got thoughts? You got an answer You got thoughts? You got an answer You got thoughts? You got an answer here? Um, sorry. I don't have an answer, but I Um, sorry. I don't have an answer, but I Um, sorry. I don't have an answer, but I looked at this. I was I was wondering, looked at this. I was I was wondering, looked at this. I was I was wondering, hey, in all this awesome OSV data, could hey, in all this awesome OSV data, could hey, in all this awesome OSV data, could I find vulnerabilities lacking CVE IDs I find vulnerabilities lacking CVE IDs I find vulnerabilities lacking CVE IDs and then go make a case to go get them and then go make a case to go get them and then go make a case to go get them assigned with a machine? Maybe assigned with a machine? Maybe assigned with a machine? Maybe potentially. I couldn't I didn't find potentially. I couldn't I didn't find potentially. I couldn't I didn't find any easily. Okay. It's it's I think this any easily. Okay. It's it's I think this any easily. Okay. It's it's I think this the easiest thing I can say is it's not the easiest thing I can say is it's not the easiest thing I can say is it's not at all a onetoone mapping. Sure. If at all a onetoone mapping. Sure. If at all a onetoone mapping. Sure. If you're thinking in CVE, individual JSON you're thinking in CVE, individual JSON you're thinking in CVE, individual JSON files, individual records, it's not files, individual records, it's not files, individual records, it's not quite the same. Yeah, you got to spend quite the same. Yeah, you got to spend quite the same. Yeah, you got to spend some time looking at it. I haven't got some time looking at it. I haven't got some time looking at it. I haven't got there yet, but I'm going to be looking. there yet, but I'm going to be looking. there yet, but I'm going to be looking. Yeah, I guess what what what I'll say is Yeah, I guess what what what I'll say is Yeah, I guess what what what I'll say is that the original focus of this exercise that the original focus of this exercise that the original focus of this exercise was source code level vulnerabilities. was source code level vulnerabilities. was source code level vulnerabilities. A bunch of those numbers will probably A bunch of those numbers will probably A bunch of those numbers will probably be OSS buzz findings be OSS buzz findings be OSS buzz findings which lack correspondence with the CVE which lack correspondence with the CVE which lack correspondence with the CVE but but there is potentially a CVE or but but there is potentially a CVE or but but there is potentially a CVE or there might be an opportunity for there there might be an opportunity for there there might be an opportunity for there to be a CVE for those. The other one is to be a CVE for those. The other one is to be a CVE for those. The other one is that you might we might have a a GitHub that you might we might have a a GitHub that you might we might have a a GitHub security advisory record, a security advisory record, a security advisory record, a CVE, a Debian advisory, a Red Hat CVE, a Debian advisory, a Red Hat CVE, a Debian advisory, a Red Hat advisory, a Golang advisory, a Python advisory, a Golang advisory, a Python advisory, a Golang advisory, a Python advisory, all for what is essentially advisory, all for what is essentially advisory, all for what is essentially the same CVE, but those ones will tie the same CVE, but those ones will tie the same CVE, but those ones will tie back to a CVE ID. So, that wouldn't fall back to a CVE ID. So, that wouldn't fall back to a CVE ID. So, that wouldn't fall into that that I'm really bad at maths. into that that I'm really bad at maths. into that that I'm really bad at maths. What's the difference there? Um that What's the difference there? Um that What's the difference there? Um that that delta that we're sort of pondering, that delta that we're sort of pondering, that delta that we're sort of pondering, but um yeah, you're welcome. Thanks for but um yeah, you're welcome. Thanks for but um yeah, you're welcome. Thanks for the question. question from the the question. question from the the question. question from the internet. Uh, this might be a little internet. Uh, this might be a little internet. Uh, this might be a little cheeky, but is there a PR to stop cheeky, but is there a PR to stop cheeky, but is there a PR to stop allowing NA to be listed as the vendor allowing NA to be listed as the vendor allowing NA to be listed as the vendor or the product? Any additional context or the product? Any additional context or the product? Any additional context random stranger might want to add to the random stranger might want to add to the random stranger might want to add to the internet? Oh, no. I fixed that NA internet? Oh, no. I fixed that NA internet? Oh, no. I fixed that NA problem for you, Andrew, during the problem for you, Andrew, during the problem for you, Andrew, during the talk. I updated the schema to not allow talk. I updated the schema to not allow talk. I updated the schema to not allow it. So, if somebody will just smash that it. So, if somebody will just smash that it. So, if somebody will just smash that merge button, there'll be no more TVs merge button, there'll be no more TVs merge button, there'll be no more TVs with NA allowed. with NA allowed. with NA allowed. Yeah. And and like I'm I'm a man of Yeah. And and like I'm I'm a man of Yeah. And and like I'm I'm a man of action. Send more PRs. Just just do it, action. Send more PRs. Just just do it, action. Send more PRs. Just just do it, you know, like like have the you know, like like have the you know, like like have the conversation over a PR bike shed the conversation over a PR bike shed the conversation over a PR bike shed the actual implementation in a PR. Like I'm actual implementation in a PR. Like I'm actual implementation in a PR. Like I'm I'm the QWG meetings are at 6:00 a.m. or I'm the QWG meetings are at 6:00 a.m. or I'm the QWG meetings are at 6:00 a.m. or 7:00 a.m. depending on daylight saving 7:00 a.m. depending on daylight saving 7:00 a.m. depending on daylight saving time for me. I don't want to get up that time for me. I don't want to get up that time for me. I don't want to get up that early and spend multiple weeks early and spend multiple weeks early and spend multiple weeks of talking about stuff. Let let's let's of talking about stuff. Let let's let's of talking about stuff. Let let's let's act with a sense of urgency. act with a sense of urgency. act with a sense of urgency. Let's let's spitball the PRs rather than Let's let's spitball the PRs rather than Let's let's spitball the PRs rather than just keep talking. just keep talking. just keep talking. Thanks for great talk, Andrew. Funnily Thanks for great talk, Andrew. Funnily Thanks for great talk, Andrew. Funnily enough, I think NA is the default value enough, I think NA is the default value enough, I think NA is the default value for the MITER CNA. So I I wonder if for the MITER CNA. So I I wonder if for the MITER CNA. So I I wonder if that's going to be merged. Anyway, my that's going to be merged. Anyway, my that's going to be merged. Anyway, my question was, are you suggesting that we question was, are you suggesting that we question was, are you suggesting that we drop bug bounty programs for being CNAs? drop bug bounty programs for being CNAs? drop bug bounty programs for being CNAs? Hot take. Um I I'm not necessarily. I I Hot take. Um I I'm not necessarily. I I Hot take. Um I I'm not necessarily. I I think that it's important to acknowledge think that it's important to acknowledge think that it's important to acknowledge that it is more difficult. I think the that it is more difficult. I think the that it is more difficult. I think the way that they will get dropped way that they will get dropped way that they will get dropped organically is if the subject of the bug organically is if the subject of the bug organically is if the subject of the bug bounty becomes a vendor, right? Because bounty becomes a vendor, right? Because bounty becomes a vendor, right? Because this is there there's that implicit this is there there's that implicit this is there there's that implicit scope clash at that point where it is no scope clash at that point where it is no scope clash at that point where it is no longer the bug bounty's purview to issue longer the bug bounty's purview to issue longer the bug bounty's purview to issue a CVE for that. You know, Veronica a CVE for that. You know, Veronica a CVE for that. You know, Veronica issues that for her product because issues that for her product because issues that for her product because Veronica is a CNA. Now obviously there's Veronica is a CNA. Now obviously there's Veronica is a CNA. Now obviously there's more software in the world and there's more software in the world and there's more software in the world and there's going to be potentially C vendor CNAs going to be potentially C vendor CNAs going to be potentially C vendor CNAs for it, right? And that that's where for it, right? And that that's where for it, right? And that that's where that's why the CNA last resort that's why the CNA last resort that's why the CNA last resort exists. exists. exists. Um so no I don't I don't think bug Um so no I don't I don't think bug Um so no I don't I don't think bug bounty providers will or should go away. bounty providers will or should go away. bounty providers will or should go away. I I do think it's incumbent on them to I I do think it's incumbent on them to I I do think it's incumbent on them to acknowledge their role in the the the acknowledge their role in the the the acknowledge their role in the the the full end to end ecosystem of making sure full end to end ecosystem of making sure full end to end ecosystem of making sure that that that the downstream the downstream the downstream uh customers that are impacted of the uh customers that are impacted of the uh customers that are impacted of the the vulnerability that they're the vulnerability that they're the vulnerability that they're publicizing can can deal with it publicizing can can deal with it publicizing can can deal with it appropriately. Right. Hello. Hello. I um I forget the slide. I Hello. Hello. I um I forget the slide. I Hello. Hello. I um I forget the slide. I forget the slide that you had on on the forget the slide that you had on on the forget the slide that you had on on the automated automated automated uh updates or updates to the schema for uh updates or updates to the schema for uh updates or updates to the schema for automation.

Anyways, it basically alluding to yeah. Anyways, it basically alluding to that there might be missing uh missing that there might be missing uh missing that there might be missing uh missing properties or properties we need to properties or properties we need to properties or properties we need to better validate. So where what what better validate. So where what what better validate. So where what what would be your first pick of something to would be your first pick of something to would be your first pick of something to focus on for uh what would help with focus on for uh what would help with focus on for uh what would help with automation? Jerry, do you want the automation? Jerry, do you want the automation? Jerry, do you want the floor? Jerry talked about this earlier in the Jerry talked about this earlier in the Jerry talked about this earlier in the week. um you know like like the week. um you know like like the week. um you know like like the the I I would say go take a look at the the I I would say go take a look at the the I I would say go take a look at the OSV scheas JSON schema syntax uh spec I OSV scheas JSON schema syntax uh spec I OSV scheas JSON schema syntax uh spec I and and please PR is welcome if if and and please PR is welcome if if and and please PR is welcome if if there's something in there where I've there's something in there where I've there's something in there where I've missed something but I I went down the missed something but I I went down the missed something but I I went down the belly of the beast of JSON schema syntax belly of the beast of JSON schema syntax belly of the beast of JSON schema syntax uh they they're cool like the JSON uh they they're cool like the JSON uh they they're cool like the JSON schema project's awesome they have schema project's awesome they have schema project's awesome they have office hours like I I had a lovely chat office hours like I I had a lovely chat office hours like I I had a lovely chat with somebody in the UK with somebody in the UK with somebody in the UK in their morning in my afternoon one in their morning in my afternoon one in their morning in my afternoon one Monday one day and said back can you Monday one day and said back can you Monday one day and said back can you help me and um yeah uh so look to the o help me and um yeah uh so look to the o help me and um yeah uh so look to the o the OSV schema for inspiration but but the OSV schema for inspiration but but the OSV schema for inspiration but but you know there is plenty plenty plenty you know there is plenty plenty plenty you know there is plenty plenty plenty plenty of opportunity for adding some plenty of opportunity for adding some plenty of opportunity for adding some some validation like like Jerry it's some validation like like Jerry it's some validation like like Jerry it's it's 1 to 4,96 characters for a it's 1 to 4,96 characters for a it's 1 to 4,96 characters for a description for example right like like description for example right like like description for example right like like that's an easy one right like find the that's an easy one right like find the that's an easy one right like find the shortest existing shortest existing shortest existing description in existence and make that description in existence and make that description in existence and make that allowable at a minimum to start the allowable at a minimum to start the allowable at a minimum to start the conversation and and then figure out conversation and and then figure out conversation and and then figure out what is what is the most sensibly what is what is the most sensibly what is what is the most sensibly short description. Like obviously we short description. Like obviously we short description. Like obviously we don't want people putting um Lauram don't want people putting um Lauram don't want people putting um Lauram Ipsum in there just Ipsum in there just Ipsum in there just to validate successfully, but you can't do that in the JSON but you can't do that in the JSON but you can't do that in the JSON schema, right? Like this is what I'm schema, right? Like this is what I'm schema, right? Like this is what I'm saying like like there are limits to saying like like there are limits to saying like like there are limits to what you can validate with the JSON what you can validate with the JSON what you can validate with the JSON schema. can validate the presence of and schema. can validate the presence of and schema. can validate the presence of and a a a reax. Maybe you can have a reax with reax. Maybe you can have a reax with reax. Maybe you can have a reax with Simba. I don't know. But you then Simba. I don't know. But you then Simba. I don't know. But you then couldn't validate that the the affected couldn't validate that the the affected couldn't validate that the the affected version the the introduced version is version the the introduced version is version the the introduced version is earlier than the the fixed version. You earlier than the the fixed version. You earlier than the the fixed version. You can still have stupid things like that. can still have stupid things like that. can still have stupid things like that. So at that point you need something more So at that point you need something more So at that point you need something more more clever like a like a llinter that more clever like a like a llinter that more clever like a like a llinter that looks at it and says no that's not looks at it and says no that's not looks at it and says no that's not right. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. We've had some good chat. No, I have a I We've had some good chat. No, I have a I We've had some good chat. No, I have a I have a silly pedantic question. Nothing have a silly pedantic question. Nothing have a silly pedantic question. Nothing interesting. Oh, no. One of your slides interesting. Oh, no. One of your slides interesting. Oh, no. One of your slides said you had 22 feeds and another one said you had 22 feeds and another one said you had 22 feeds and another one said 21 and then I as of 2024, we've got said 21 and then I as of 2024, we've got said 21 and then I as of 2024, we've got an extra one that came on. What are an extra one that came on. What are an extra one that came on. What are those? But then I could validate it those? But then I could validate it those? But then I could validate it myself, but then so I went to OSB.dev myself, but then so I went to OSB.dev myself, but then so I went to OSB.dev and I only counted 18 feeds. Do you have and I only counted 18 feeds. Do you have and I only counted 18 feeds. Do you have like an extra slide where it like Okay. like an extra slide where it like Okay. like an extra slide where it like Okay. There's a difference between a home There's a difference between a home There's a difference between a home database and an ecosystem. Okay. Right. database and an ecosystem. Okay. Right. database and an ecosystem. Okay. Right. You would have gone to OSB.dev Dev and You would have gone to OSB.dev Dev and You would have gone to OSB.dev Dev and ecosystems. ecosystems. ecosystems. Um the Yeah. So, so the GitHub advisory Um the Yeah. So, so the GitHub advisory Um the Yeah. So, so the GitHub advisory database database database contributes help keep me honest friends contributes help keep me honest friends contributes help keep me honest friends in at GitHub quite a few like maybe I'll say GitHub quite a few like maybe I'll say GitHub quite a few like maybe I'll say upwards of half a dozen different upwards of half a dozen different upwards of half a dozen different ecosystems. So we for example we get go ecosystems. So we for example we get go ecosystems. So we for example we get go vulner we get go vulnerabilities with a vulner we get go vulnerabilities with a vulner we get go vulnerabilities with a ghsa and with a go prefix. So, so you ghsa and with a go prefix. So, so you ghsa and with a go prefix. So, so you know there's a a onetoone mapping know there's a a onetoone mapping know there's a a onetoone mapping between record identifier prefixes and u between record identifier prefixes and u between record identifier prefixes and u ecosystems. So that's yeah so so you you ecosystems. So that's yeah so so you you ecosystems. So that's yeah so so you you counted ecosystems I talked about home counted ecosystems I talked about home counted ecosystems I talked about home databases subtle difference. Appreciate databases subtle difference. Appreciate databases subtle difference. Appreciate the uh scrutiny. Uh you mentioned bug bounty earlier. Um Uh you mentioned bug bounty earlier. Um Uh you mentioned bug bounty earlier. Um and I'm personally not a fan of bug and I'm personally not a fan of bug and I'm personally not a fan of bug bounties handing out CVE. I think they bounties handing out CVE. I think they bounties handing out CVE. I think they should I think they should come from the should I think they should come from the should I think they should come from the vendors. Um but on top of that, Bug vendors. Um but on top of that, Bug vendors. Um but on top of that, Bug Bounty is a very powerful tool. Um I Bounty is a very powerful tool. Um I Bounty is a very powerful tool. Um I love Integrity, by the way. Yeah, love Integrity, by the way. Yeah, love Integrity, by the way. Yeah, I they they have never issued a CVE. I I I they they have never issued a CVE. I I I they they have never issued a CVE. I I don't believe I I I went and looked they don't believe I I I went and looked they don't believe I I I went and looked they are a CNA, but they've not issued one. are a CNA, but they've not issued one. are a CNA, but they've not issued one. Yeah, they're they're a powerful tool in Yeah, they're they're a powerful tool in Yeah, they're they're a powerful tool in the fact that you can encourage the fact that you can encourage the fact that you can encourage researchers to follow the best researchers to follow the best researchers to follow the best practices. Yep. And make sure you get practices. Yep. And make sure you get practices. Yep. And make sure you get the data out of them. Yes, that's my the data out of them. Yes, that's my the data out of them. Yes, that's my point. And then you can also uh use the point. And then you can also uh use the point. And then you can also uh use the bounty. All right. You didn't give me bounty. All right. You didn't give me bounty. All right. You didn't give me this, I'm cutting this much off. You this, I'm cutting this much off. You this, I'm cutting this much off. You didn't give me this, I'm cutting this didn't give me this, I'm cutting this didn't give me this, I'm cutting this much off. And money talks. The this is much off. And money talks. The this is much off. And money talks. The this is the I've I've I've quit my day job to go the I've I've I've quit my day job to go the I've I've I've quit my day job to go back to school to study psychological back to school to study psychological back to school to study psychological science and counseling. And I'm learning science and counseling. And I'm learning science and counseling. And I'm learning all about motivation this trimester. The all about motivation this trimester. The all about motivation this trimester. The there's a human factors component here, there's a human factors component here, there's a human factors component here, right? And and so I'm looking at ways right? And and so I'm looking at ways right? And and so I'm looking at ways that we can motivate carrot and stick, that we can motivate carrot and stick, that we can motivate carrot and stick, dollars and and dollars and and dollars and and praise change changes in behavior, praise change changes in behavior, praise change changes in behavior, right? Everything cyber security related right? Everything cyber security related right?
