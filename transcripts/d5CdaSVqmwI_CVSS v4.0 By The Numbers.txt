Kind: captions Language: en So I have two talks today. I'm going to So I have two talks today. I'm going to So I have two talks today. I'm going to start with CVSS by the numbers talking start with CVSS by the numbers talking start with CVSS by the numbers talking about some of the differences in the about some of the differences in the about some of the differences in the math between version three and version math between version three and version math between version three and version four and then the second part talk about four and then the second part talk about four and then the second part talk about some updates from the CVSSI what what some updates from the CVSSI what what some updates from the CVSSI what what we've been working on in the we've been working on in the we've been working on in the SIG. I had this a little bit out of SIG. I had this a little bit out of SIG. I had this a little bit out of order. So, I want to show this and if order. So, I want to show this and if order. So, I want to show this and if you don't know who I am and you should you don't know who I am and you should you don't know who I am and you should not know who I am, but I'm Nick Leali. I not know who I am, but I'm Nick Leali. I not know who I am, but I'm Nick Leali. I am one of the CVSSI am one of the CVSSI am one of the CVSSI co-chairs. I'm also a member of the co-chairs. I'm also a member of the co-chairs. I'm also a member of the Cisco PERT. I'm an incident manager on Cisco PERT. I'm an incident manager on Cisco PERT. I'm an incident manager on the PERT team. I've been a co-chair of the PERT team. I've been a co-chair of the PERT team. I've been a co-chair of the CVSS SIG for a couple years now the CVSS SIG for a couple years now the CVSS SIG for a couple years now since November since November since November 2023. I've been in the CVSs ecosystem 2023. I've been in the CVSs ecosystem 2023. I've been in the CVSs ecosystem and doing scoring for CVSS for a long and doing scoring for CVSS for a long and doing scoring for CVSS for a long long time. Who remembers version two. long time. Who remembers version two. long time. Who remembers version two. Yeah, doing that. Um, and please do not Yeah, doing that. Um, and please do not Yeah, doing that. Um, and please do not judge me too harshly. There is going to judge me too harshly. There is going to judge me too harshly. There is going to be some code as part of this, a tool be some code as part of this, a tool be some code as part of this, a tool that you are more than welcome to use. I that you are more than welcome to use. I that you are more than welcome to use. I am a terrible developer, but I wanted to am a terrible developer, but I wanted to am a terrible developer, but I wanted to kind of make this tool to answer a kind of make this tool to answer a kind of make this tool to answer a question. And so that question really is question. And so that question really is question. And so that question really is what's different about CBSS version what's different about CBSS version what's different about CBSS version 4? So I'm going to go over what makes 4? So I'm going to go over what makes 4? So I'm going to go over what makes CBSS version 4 CBSS version 4 CBSS version 4 different? Uh look at some of the data. different? Uh look at some of the data. different? Uh look at some of the data. uh what we can learn from that uh what we can learn from that uh what we can learn from that differences between version three and differences between version three and differences between version three and version four data and and some of the version four data and and some of the version four data and and some of the resources that that I've talked resources that that I've talked resources that that I've talked about. So really CVS version 4 is about. So really CVS version 4 is about. So really CVS version 4 is something new. It's not just 0.9 greater something new. It's not just 0.9 greater something new. It's not just 0.9 greater than version 3.1. It's it's brand new. than version 3.1. It's it's brand new. than version 3.1. It's it's brand new. And this talk is really about how you And this talk is really about how you And this talk is really about how you can adopt if you're looking to use can adopt if you're looking to use can adopt if you're looking to use version 4 in your environment as part of version 4 in your environment as part of version 4 in your environment as part of either your vulnerability management either your vulnerability management either your vulnerability management system or part of your incident respon system or part of your incident respon system or part of your incident respon response handling system or if you're a response handling system or if you're a response handling system or if you're a PERD and you're providing guidance to PERD and you're providing guidance to PERD and you're providing guidance to customers about your own customers about your own customers about your own advisories what you can do uh and how advisories what you can do uh and how advisories what you can do uh and how you can prepare to use version 4 in your you can prepare to use version 4 in your you can prepare to use version 4 in your own own own environment. So CVSS version 4 is not environment. So CVSS version 4 is not environment. So CVSS version 4 is not just a drop in replacement for version just a drop in replacement for version just a drop in replacement for version 3. It's different. It really is 3. It's different. It really is 3. It's different. It really is different. Uh the math and some of the different. Uh the math and some of the different. Uh the math and some of the assumptions in CVSS version 4 are assumptions in CVSS version 4 are assumptions in CVSS version 4 are different. There are going to be changes different. There are going to be changes different. There are going to be changes in the math that change how decisions in the math that change how decisions in the math that change how decisions are made. We've, you know, we all know are made. We've, you know, we all know are made. We've, you know, we all know what some of these bins are and how we what some of these bins are and how we what some of these bins are and how we call something low, medium, high, call something low, medium, high, call something low, medium, high, critical. We make decisions based on critical. We make decisions based on critical. We make decisions based on those things. And in version four, those those things. And in version four, those those things. And in version four, those are going to be different. they're going are going to be different. they're going are going to be different. they're going to be different from version three. So to be different from version three. So to be different from version three. So once you know once of those things how once you know once of those things how once you know once of those things how they differ, you can make a they differ, you can make a they differ, you can make a determination about how you can handle determination about how you can handle determination about how you can handle the changes from version 4 in your own environment. environment. environment. Oh, I needed to format this. It's not Oh, I needed to format this. It's not Oh, I needed to format this. It's not formatted correctly. Why care about the formatted correctly. Why care about the formatted correctly. Why care about the numbers? Well, really because customers numbers? Well, really because customers numbers? Well, really because customers ask us about it all the time and it gets ask us about it all the time and it gets ask us about it all the time and it gets annoying. So, you know, to to because of annoying. So, you know, to to because of annoying. So, you know, to to because of those changing demands in version four, those changing demands in version four, those changing demands in version four, we should care about it. But really, it we should care about it. But really, it we should care about it. But really, it it it influences our decisions. And if it it influences our decisions. And if it it influences our decisions. And if something in version three is a high and something in version three is a high and something in version three is a high and in version four, it's a medium, we need in version four, it's a medium, we need in version four, it's a medium, we need to understand why that is. And that to understand why that is. And that to understand why that is. And that happens, trust me. And so, you need to happens, trust me. And so, you need to happens, trust me. And so, you need to understand what that is. There's also understand what that is. There's also understand what that is. There's also regulation, there's SLAs, there's a CRA, regulation, there's SLAs, there's a CRA, regulation, there's SLAs, there's a CRA, there's all of your internal there's all of your internal there's all of your internal SLAs's, contractual obligations, SLAs's, contractual obligations, SLAs's, contractual obligations, compliance obligations. The math is compliance obligations. The math is compliance obligations. The math is important. Even though we've talked important. Even though we've talked important. Even though we've talked about getting rid of the math entirely about getting rid of the math entirely about getting rid of the math entirely and there have been lots of suggestions and there have been lots of suggestions and there have been lots of suggestions to that to to that uh you know kind of to that to to that uh you know kind of to that to to that uh you know kind of truth is getting rid of the math but the truth is getting rid of the math but the truth is getting rid of the math but the numbers matter and so we need to to to numbers matter and so we need to to to numbers matter and so we need to to to understand what's understand what's understand what's changing. So I started looking at some changing. So I started looking at some changing. So I started looking at some of these public sources of data to of these public sources of data to of these public sources of data to understand what changes in the data sets understand what changes in the data sets understand what changes in the data sets between version three and version four. between version three and version four. between version three and version four. So I started with a question and to you So I started with a question and to you So I started with a question and to you know to someone in this room who really know to someone in this room who really know to someone in this room who really started this talk is how was it going to started this talk is how was it going to started this talk is how was it going to change Cisco's own product security change Cisco's own product security change Cisco's own product security incident response process if we move incident response process if we move incident response process if we move from CVSS version 3.1 to version 4.0. from CVSS version 3.1 to version 4.0. from CVSS version 3.1 to version 4.0. How's that going to change how we write How's that going to change how we write How's that going to change how we write advisories? What we tell our customers advisories? What we tell our customers advisories? What we tell our customers about the impacts of vulnerabilities in about the impacts of vulnerabilities in about the impacts of vulnerabilities in our products in their environments. So our products in their environments. So our products in their environments. So that's really where I started. that's really where I started. that's really where I started. But I got curious because there are lots But I got curious because there are lots But I got curious because there are lots of organizations that are providing of organizations that are providing of organizations that are providing version 4 scores now, including GitHub, version 4 scores now, including GitHub, version 4 scores now, including GitHub, which is by and large the biggest which is by and large the biggest which is by and large the biggest producer of version 4 metrics so far, as producer of version 4 metrics so far, as producer of version 4 metrics so far, as well as data in the CVE JSON. So I well as data in the CVE JSON. So I well as data in the CVE JSON. So I looked at all of those data sources, and looked at all of those data sources, and looked at all of those data sources, and I'm going to look at those in more I'm going to look at those in more I'm going to look at those in more detail as we go through it. So how am I comparing these scores? it. So how am I comparing these scores? it. So how am I comparing these scores? So the script will check whatever data So the script will check whatever data So the script will check whatever data source you're interested in. Can be a source you're interested in. Can be a source you're interested in. Can be a local file. It can be JSON things in a local file. It can be JSON things in a local file. It can be JSON things in a directory. I'm looking at doing some directory. I'm looking at doing some directory. I'm looking at doing some statistical comparison between those statistical comparison between those statistical comparison between those things using uh Python and things using uh Python and things using uh Python and NumPy creating graphs of those things NumPy creating graphs of those things NumPy creating graphs of those things and then really I'm looking at more of and then really I'm looking at more of and then really I'm looking at more of those data sources. those data sources. those data sources. But this is generally how the script But this is generally how the script But this is generally how the script that's available. grab it. And please that's available. grab it. And please that's available. grab it. And please don't judge my code too harshly. harshly. harshly. Um, again, I'm an amateur, but if you Um, again, I'm an amateur, but if you Um, again, I'm an amateur, but if you know you want to use this for your own know you want to use this for your own know you want to use this for your own environment, I encourage you to do so. environment, I encourage you to do so. environment, I encourage you to do so. This method or someone else, it's kind This method or someone else, it's kind This method or someone else, it's kind of just to start the conversation about of just to start the conversation about of just to start the conversation about how the scores that you're generating how the scores that you're generating how the scores that you're generating will change into your own environment, will change into your own environment, will change into your own environment, and you can look at that for yourselves. and you can look at that for yourselves. and you can look at that for yourselves. So some of the terminology that I'm So some of the terminology that I'm So some of the terminology that I'm going to talk about briefly uh when I'm going to talk about briefly uh when I'm going to talk about briefly uh when I'm doing some of these statistical doing some of these statistical doing some of these statistical comparisons I'm really looking at a raw comparisons I'm really looking at a raw comparisons I'm really looking at a raw count of records how many records appear count of records how many records appear count of records how many records appear in the database in the data set and that in the database in the data set and that in the database in the data set and that is for each record. This is typically a is for each record. This is typically a is for each record. This is typically a CVE that has a CVE or CVSS version three CVE that has a CVE or CVSS version three CVE that has a CVE or CVSS version three score and a version four score so that I score and a version four score so that I score and a version four score so that I can compare them. I'm also looking at can compare them. I'm also looking at can compare them. I'm also looking at the average change. So that is you know the average change. So that is you know the average change. So that is you know on average across the whole data set on average across the whole data set on average across the whole data set what changed the numeric score from what changed the numeric score from what changed the numeric score from version three to version 4 and then the version three to version 4 and then the version three to version 4 and then the mode the most common mode the most common mode the most common change. There can be some sort of change. There can be some sort of change. There can be some sort of strange results and then the last piece strange results and then the last piece strange results and then the last piece is the qualitative boundary shift. So we is the qualitative boundary shift. So we is the qualitative boundary shift. So we look look look at this is our categorization there in at this is our categorization there in at this is our categorization there in Cisco there are lots of other Cisco there are lots of other Cisco there are lots of other organizations who have their own organizations who have their own organizations who have their own qualitative boundaries. This is fairly qualitative boundaries. This is fairly qualitative boundaries. This is fairly common in the industry. You can set it common in the industry. You can set it common in the industry. You can set it to something different if you like, but to something different if you like, but to something different if you like, but this seems to be pretty standard, right? this seems to be pretty standard, right? this seems to be pretty standard, right? So, looking at how qualitative So, looking at how qualitative So, looking at how qualitative boundaries changed from version three to boundaries changed from version three to boundaries changed from version three to version four, whether it's skipping version four, whether it's skipping version four, whether it's skipping around or staying the same. So, this is the the start the sort same. So, this is the the start the sort same. So, this is the the start the sort of genesis of it. And in our in our data of genesis of it. And in our in our data of genesis of it. And in our in our data set, these are the Cisco studied uh the set, these are the Cisco studied uh the set, these are the Cisco studied uh the the Cisco public CVEEs that I started to the Cisco public CVEEs that I started to the Cisco public CVEEs that I started to take a look at. So internally we are take a look at. So internally we are take a look at. So internally we are scoring for version 4. We don't yet scoring for version 4. We don't yet scoring for version 4. We don't yet expose those, but these are all of our expose those, but these are all of our expose those, but these are all of our public CVEEs that have both version public CVEEs that have both version public CVEEs that have both version three and version four three and version four three and version four scores. The 308 records on average our scores. The 308 records on average our scores. The 308 records on average our score increases by.36. score increases by.36. score increases by.36. So across the whole range now this this So across the whole range now this this So across the whole range now this this histogram and this is generated by the histogram and this is generated by the histogram and this is generated by the tool. You can try it on your own tool. You can try it on your own tool. You can try it on your own data. This shows the the the changes data. This shows the the the changes data. This shows the the the changes from version three to version four. You from version three to version four. You from version three to version four. You can sort of see on the right hand side can sort of see on the right hand side can sort of see on the right hand side most of the scores went most of the scores went most of the scores went up right in the middle that 111 those up right in the middle that 111 those up right in the middle that 111 those are the zero scores. So, so those scores are the zero scores. So, so those scores are the zero scores. So, so those scores did not change at all, but some went up did not change at all, but some went up did not change at all, but some went up by 0.5 by one by point one 1.5 by two. by 0.5 by one by point one 1.5 by two. by 0.5 by one by point one 1.5 by two. So, on average they increased by 36. The So, on average they increased by 36. The So, on average they increased by 36. The the most common change is that 111 on the most common change is that 111 on the most common change is that 111 on average there the the most common change average there the the most common change average there the the most common change was zero although there were many more was zero although there were many more was zero although there were many more to the to the to the right. The range the the biggest right. The range the the biggest right. The range the the biggest increase is 2.6. So one score increased increase is 2.6. So one score increased increase is 2.6. So one score increased by 2.6 and then one score decreased. But by 2.6 and then one score decreased. But by 2.6 and then one score decreased. But really what we care about the most is really what we care about the most is really what we care about the most is that qualitative boundary shift. On that qualitative boundary shift. On that qualitative boundary shift. On average or not on average but but over average or not on average but but over average or not on average but but over the entire range 15% of scores change the entire range 15% of scores change the entire range 15% of scores change qualitative boundaries from low to high, qualitative boundaries from low to high, qualitative boundaries from low to high, low to medium, something like that. So low to medium, something like that. So low to medium, something like that. So let's look at those in more detail. This let's look at those in more detail. This let's look at those in more detail. This graph also generated by the tool shows graph also generated by the tool shows graph also generated by the tool shows the the graph of the version three the the graph of the version three the the graph of the version three scores and the version four scores. So scores and the version four scores. So scores and the version four scores. So if you sort of uh you know unshift your if you sort of uh you know unshift your if you sort of uh you know unshift your eyes a little bit and look through it, eyes a little bit and look through it, eyes a little bit and look through it, it makes a cool picture of a sailboat or it makes a cool picture of a sailboat or it makes a cool picture of a sailboat or something. But it the qualitative something. But it the qualitative something. But it the qualitative boundary shifts are listed here. So we boundary shifts are listed here. So we boundary shifts are listed here. So we have 15% of those 49 out of 3 have 15% of those 49 out of 3 have 15% of those 49 out of 3 308 on uh 42 increased low to medium 308 on uh 42 increased low to medium 308 on uh 42 increased low to medium five medium to high 36 and then some five medium to high 36 and then some five medium to high 36 and then some decreased. I think one of the decreased. I think one of the decreased. I think one of the interesting things and we'll can look at interesting things and we'll can look at interesting things and we'll can look at these in bigger data sets later is that these in bigger data sets later is that these in bigger data sets later is that there are a few that change from there are a few that change from there are a few that change from critical to critical to critical to medium. That's a weird result and that's medium. That's a weird result and that's medium. That's a weird result and that's something that you all need and you know something that you all need and you know something that you all need and you know we need to be aware of when we're doing we need to be aware of when we're doing we need to be aware of when we're doing evaluations of vulnerabilities. What evaluations of vulnerabilities. What evaluations of vulnerabilities. What changed in that vulnerability between changed in that vulnerability between changed in that vulnerability between version three and version four? The version three and version four? The version three and version four? The nature of the vulnerability didn't nature of the vulnerability didn't nature of the vulnerability didn't change but the assessment is radically change but the assessment is radically change but the assessment is radically different. So why all of a sudden in different. So why all of a sudden in different. So why all of a sudden in version three is sort of critical and in version three is sort of critical and in version three is sort of critical and in version four it's immediate? I don't version four it's immediate? I don't version four it's immediate? I don't know. But you should be aware of that know. But you should be aware of that know. But you should be aware of that and you should plan for that in your own and you should plan for that in your own and you should plan for that in your own environment. So that's the Cisco data. environment. So that's the Cisco data. environment. So that's the Cisco data. That's a very small set of data and That's a very small set of data and That's a very small set of data and Cisco does a certain set of Cisco does a certain set of Cisco does a certain set of vulnerabilities, right? Our our products vulnerabilities, right? Our our products vulnerabilities, right? Our our products tend to be tend to be tend to be networkbased devices and other things. networkbased devices and other things. networkbased devices and other things. Not as many endpoints. So we have Not as many endpoints. So we have Not as many endpoints. So we have certain, you know, classifications of certain, you know, classifications of certain, you know, classifications of vulnerabilities that are more common. vulnerabilities that are more common. vulnerabilities that are more common. Now let's look at a bigger set of data. Now let's look at a bigger set of data. Now let's look at a bigger set of data. So the CVE program data 3500 records as So the CVE program data 3500 records as So the CVE program data 3500 records as of March 14th is when I pulled the data of March 14th is when I pulled the data of March 14th is when I pulled the data the last time to put this all together. the last time to put this all together. the last time to put this all together. March 14th they had 3516 records that March 14th they had 3516 records that March 14th they had 3516 records that were had both version three and version were had both version three and version were had both version three and version 4 vectors. on average quite a bit of a 4 vectors. on average quite a bit of a 4 vectors. on average quite a bit of a different change on average different change on average different change on average just.19 of change their average their just.19 of change their average their just.19 of change their average their the mode change actually the most common the mode change actually the most common the mode change actually the most common change was a decrease of 0.1 I don't change was a decrease of 0.1 I don't change was a decrease of 0.1 I don't know or 1.0 know rather I don't know why know or 1.0 know rather I don't know why know or 1.0 know rather I don't know why I want to dive into it a little bit more I want to dive into it a little bit more I want to dive into it a little bit more but they had a big shift some scores but they had a big shift some scores but they had a big shift some scores decreased but on average they they decreased but on average they they decreased but on average they they increased their qualitative boundary increased their qualitative boundary increased their qualitative boundary shifts are are radically shifts are are radically shifts are are radically different on on average a different on on average a different on on average a third third third 1,111 CVE change qualitative 1,111 CVE change qualitative 1,111 CVE change qualitative boundaries that's a big difference the boundaries that's a big difference the boundaries that's a big difference the range is also pretty big although range is also pretty big although range is also pretty big although there's some weird outliers. So, let's there's some weird outliers. So, let's there's some weird outliers. So, let's look at those qualitative boundary look at those qualitative boundary look at those qualitative boundary shifts. You can see that big there shifts. You can see that big there shifts. You can see that big there there's a lot of scores that are there's a lot of scores that are there's a lot of scores that are somewhere in the somewhere in the somewhere in the five four range. I think they're cross- five four range. I think they're cross- five four range. I think they're cross- sight sight sight scripting, but you can see scores move scripting, but you can see scores move scripting, but you can see scores move around a lot. So if you're doing around a lot. So if you're doing around a lot. So if you're doing vulnerability assessment and you are if vulnerability assessment and you are if vulnerability assessment and you are if you're a pie and you're publishing you're a pie and you're publishing you're a pie and you're publishing advisories and you do something advisories and you do something advisories and you do something different for a medium or a critical or different for a medium or a critical or different for a medium or a critical or a low or a a low or a a low or a high, you're going to have in the CVE's high, you're going to have in the CVE's high, you're going to have in the CVE's data 491 new medium advisories that you data 491 new medium advisories that you data 491 new medium advisories that you wouldn't otherwise have written an wouldn't otherwise have written an wouldn't otherwise have written an advisory for. If you're a incident advisory for. If you're a incident advisory for. If you're a incident response team or a vulnerability response team or a vulnerability response team or a vulnerability management team, all of a sudden there management team, all of a sudden there management team, all of a sudden there are 491 new CVES that you have to go are 491 new CVES that you have to go are 491 new CVES that you have to go track down that wouldn't otherwise have track down that wouldn't otherwise have track down that wouldn't otherwise have been part of your compliance for PCIDSS. been part of your compliance for PCIDSS. been part of your compliance for PCIDSS. So there's a lot of shifting here and So there's a lot of shifting here and So there's a lot of shifting here and the other side is true. the other side is true. the other side is true. 359 CVEes go from medium or go from high 359 CVEes go from medium or go from high 359 CVEes go from medium or go from high to medium. Why are they suddenly less to medium. Why are they suddenly less to medium. Why are they suddenly less important? They probably aren't, but important? They probably aren't, but important? They probably aren't, but they're evaluated they're evaluated they're evaluated different. So, this is a big shift, different. So, this is a big shift, different. So, this is a big shift, especially if your vulnerability especially if your vulnerability especially if your vulnerability scanner, if your vulnerability scanner, if your vulnerability scanner, if your vulnerability management program is making decisions management program is making decisions management program is making decisions based on version three data. It's going based on version three data. It's going based on version three data. It's going to be very different in version 4. GitHub is an even bigger source of 4. GitHub is an even bigger source of 4. GitHub is an even bigger source of data than the CVE program. I've split data than the CVE program. I've split data than the CVE program. I've split this into two uh into two this into two uh into two this into two uh into two um two groups. So there's GitHub um two groups. So there's GitHub um two groups. So there's GitHub advisories that are reviewed and GitHub advisories that are reviewed and GitHub advisories that are reviewed and GitHub advisories that are unreed. And thank advisories that are unreed. And thank advisories that are unreed. And thank you to folks from GitHub who answered my you to folks from GitHub who answered my you to folks from GitHub who answered my question yesterday. I did not know what question yesterday. I did not know what question yesterday. I did not know what the difference was, but reviewed the difference was, but reviewed the difference was, but reviewed advisories are those that have had human advisories are those that have had human advisories are those that have had human review that will trigger reports through review that will trigger reports through review that will trigger reports through dependabot and are making decisions dependabot and are making decisions dependabot and are making decisions based on this. So, we'll look at the based on this. So, we'll look at the based on this. So, we'll look at the reviewed and then we'll look at the reviewed and then we'll look at the reviewed and then we'll look at the unreed, which is a kind of a wild west unreed, which is a kind of a wild west unreed, which is a kind of a wild west of vulnerability data, which is pretty of vulnerability data, which is pretty of vulnerability data, which is pretty wild, but also really interesting to wild, but also really interesting to wild, but also really interesting to look at. So looking at the reviewed look at. So looking at the reviewed look at. So looking at the reviewed advisories we have 2720 records a bigger advisories we have 2720 records a bigger advisories we have 2720 records a bigger average change on average increasing average change on average increasing average change on average increasing by.34 a lot of scores increased by a big by.34 a lot of scores increased by a big by.34 a lot of scores increased by a big chunk that mode of 1.2 a big jump there chunk that mode of 1.2 a big jump there chunk that mode of 1.2 a big jump there and they have a smaller ratio but also and they have a smaller ratio but also and they have a smaller ratio but also still a big amount of qualitative still a big amount of qualitative still a big amount of qualitative boundary shifts at 23%. There's a weird boundary shifts at 23%. There's a weird boundary shifts at 23%. There's a weird range here not entirely certain. I think range here not entirely certain. I think range here not entirely certain. I think some of these may just be wrong because some of these may just be wrong because some of these may just be wrong because an increase of 8.7 looks like it just an increase of 8.7 looks like it just an increase of 8.7 looks like it just had a zero score for version three and had a zero score for version three and had a zero score for version three and then an 8.7 for version four. And I then an 8.7 for version four. And I then an 8.7 for version four. And I think it's the other way around for the think it's the other way around for the think it's the other way around for the decrease. So that range is a little bit decrease. So that range is a little bit decrease. So that range is a little bit a little bit a little bit a little bit deceptive. But here's what some of those deceptive. But here's what some of those deceptive. But here's what some of those qualitative boundary shifts look qualitative boundary shifts look qualitative boundary shifts look like. Big big increase from the the uh like. Big big increase from the the uh like. Big big increase from the the uh low to medium. And then interestingly low to medium. And then interestingly low to medium. And then interestingly different from the CVE program where it different from the CVE program where it different from the CVE program where it was more low to medium there are more in was more low to medium there are more in was more low to medium there are more in GitHub that are medium to high. So quite GitHub that are medium to high. So quite GitHub that are medium to high. So quite a bit more that that are increasing and a bit more that that are increasing and a bit more that that are increasing and then there are some decreases. Those are then there are some decreases. Those are then there are some decreases. Those are going from you know again high to medium going from you know again high to medium going from you know again high to medium of sort of changing. of sort of changing. of sort of changing. But I mean, we're talking about a lot of But I mean, we're talking about a lot of But I mean, we're talking about a lot of net net net new advisory type of things or new advisory type of things or new advisory type of things or compliance types of decisions that are compliance types of decisions that are compliance types of decisions that are being made that are more highs and being made that are more highs and being made that are more highs and criticals essentially in version 4 than criticals essentially in version 4 than criticals essentially in version 4 than version version version 3.1. Something really to be aware 3.1. Something really to be aware 3.1. Something really to be aware of. Now, this is the unreviewed data. of. Now, this is the unreviewed data. of. Now, this is the unreviewed data. There are hundreds of thousands of There are hundreds of thousands of There are hundreds of thousands of advisories, but there are 3,400 records advisories, but there are 3,400 records advisories, but there are 3,400 records as of the middle of as of the middle of as of the middle of March. Again, a smaller average change. March. Again, a smaller average change. March. Again, a smaller average change. A lot of boundary shifts. A lot of boundary shifts. A lot of boundary shifts. 33% of all of the records in the 33% of all of the records in the 33% of all of the records in the unreviewed set uh changed boundaries. unreviewed set uh changed boundaries. unreviewed set uh changed boundaries. and uh about a wash here and uh about a wash here and uh about a wash here because quite a few increases, quite a because quite a few increases, quite a because quite a few increases, quite a few decreases, but things are shifting few decreases, but things are shifting few decreases, but things are shifting all over the all over the all over the place. There were many more big shifts place. There were many more big shifts place. There were many more big shifts in the the unreviewed advisory data in the the unreviewed advisory data in the the unreviewed advisory data looking at 45 and again more critical to looking at 45 and again more critical to looking at 45 and again more critical to medium. I I really am curious to look a medium. I I really am curious to look a medium. I I really am curious to look a little bit more about why those things little bit more about why those things little bit more about why those things in decreased so much, but there were in decreased so much, but there were in decreased so much, but there were even some big increases that went from even some big increases that went from even some big increases that went from medium to critical or low to high. medium to critical or low to high. medium to critical or low to high. Um, again, not sure why, but to be Um, again, not sure why, but to be Um, again, not sure why, but to be forewarned is fore armed and you can forewarned is fore armed and you can forewarned is fore armed and you can have a way to look at this data in your have a way to look at this data in your have a way to look at this data in your own environment. So some of the the own environment. So some of the the own environment. So some of the the summarizations you know overall across summarizations you know overall across summarizations you know overall across the whole range the scores don't change the whole range the scores don't change the whole range the scores don't change that much from version 3.1 to version that much from version 3.1 to version that much from version 3.1 to version 4.0 4.0 4.0 on average uh Cisco's scores on average uh Cisco's scores on average uh Cisco's scores um you know increased by.3 the CVE um you know increased by.3 the CVE um you know increased by.3 the CVE program by point4 you so it's about a program by point4 you so it's about a program by point4 you so it's about a three across the whole three across the whole three across the whole range there are range there are range there are um some individually big um some individually big um some individually big shifts and these are the ratios of the shifts and these are the ratios of the shifts and these are the ratios of the entire set of data so green are the entire set of data so green are the entire set of data so green are the things that did not things that did not things that did not change these are again their qualitative change these are again their qualitative change these are again their qualitative ative boundaries. So green are the ative boundaries. So green are the ative boundaries. So green are the things that did not change. Blue are the things that did not change. Blue are the things that did not change. Blue are the increased qualitative boundary. So any increased qualitative boundary. So any increased qualitative boundary. So any increase from low to medium or medium to increase from low to medium or medium to increase from low to medium or medium to high and the orange are the decreases. high and the orange are the decreases. high and the orange are the decreases. So those are decreased from critical to So those are decreased from critical to So those are decreased from critical to low or something like that. low or something like that. low or something like that. That ratio may be different depending on That ratio may be different depending on That ratio may be different depending on what kind of a vendor you are, what kind what kind of a vendor you are, what kind what kind of a vendor you are, what kind of products you have, what products and of products you have, what products and of products you have, what products and services and things exist in your services and things exist in your services and things exist in your environment. So you need to determine environment. So you need to determine environment. So you need to determine for yourselves what the impacts of for yourselves what the impacts of for yourselves what the impacts of moving to version 4 would have on your moving to version 4 would have on your moving to version 4 would have on your own environment. You know, it varies on own environment. You know, it varies on own environment. You know, it varies on C.WE. It varies on a lot of things, but C.WE. It varies on a lot of things, but C.WE. It varies on a lot of things, but really again CBSS version 4 is really again CBSS version 4 is really again CBSS version 4 is different. uh and to understand what the different. uh and to understand what the different. uh and to understand what the impacts to your own environment is. Um impacts to your own environment is. Um impacts to your own environment is. Um you know you you should have an you know you you should have an you know you you should have an understanding of understanding of understanding of that. This again just showing that those that. This again just showing that those that. This again just showing that those boundary boundary boundary changes especially for if you're a pie changes especially for if you're a pie changes especially for if you're a pie and you're trying to make decisions and you're trying to make decisions and you're trying to make decisions based on am I going to write an advisory based on am I going to write an advisory based on am I going to write an advisory for this thing or not? Am I going to for this thing or not? Am I going to for this thing or not? Am I going to tell my customers is this severe? Is it tell my customers is this severe? Is it tell my customers is this severe? Is it critical? Is it low? critical? Is it low? critical? Is it low? There are going to be There are going to be There are going to be changes if you are a vendor like Cisco. changes if you are a vendor like Cisco. changes if you are a vendor like Cisco. There are going to be a small amount but There are going to be a small amount but There are going to be a small amount but a handful of new high-end critical a handful of new high-end critical a handful of new high-end critical advisories you're going to have to advisories you're going to have to advisories you're going to have to write. There will be a few tiny tiny write. There will be a few tiny tiny write. There will be a few tiny tiny blue bar a few new mediums but on blue bar a few new mediums but on blue bar a few new mediums but on average not a whole lot more. If you average not a whole lot more. If you average not a whole lot more. If you are looking at data in the CVE program, are looking at data in the CVE program, are looking at data in the CVE program, you're going to have a lot of new medium you're going to have a lot of new medium you're going to have a lot of new medium advisories, a lot of new vulnerabilities advisories, a lot of new vulnerabilities advisories, a lot of new vulnerabilities in your environment to track down that in your environment to track down that in your environment to track down that suddenly were not vulnerabilities or not suddenly were not vulnerabilities or not suddenly were not vulnerabilities or not above that 4.0 threshold in PCIDSS or above that 4.0 threshold in PCIDSS or above that 4.0 threshold in PCIDSS or whatever other regulatory framework you whatever other regulatory framework you whatever other regulatory framework you care about. Now there will be many more care about. Now there will be many more care about. Now there will be many more in your environment. But the nice thing in your environment. But the nice thing in your environment. But the nice thing is there are fewer high-end criticals if is there are fewer high-end criticals if is there are fewer high-end criticals if you're only looking at CVE you're only looking at CVE you're only looking at CVE data and GitHub kind of mirrors that data and GitHub kind of mirrors that data and GitHub kind of mirrors that that the GitHub unreviewed data mirrors that the GitHub unreviewed data mirrors that the GitHub unreviewed data mirrors that. But in the reviewed data, there that. But in the reviewed data, there that. But in the reviewed data, there are far more high-end criticals and just are far more high-end criticals and just are far more high-end criticals and just a few new mediums. So again, if we if we a few new mediums. So again, if we if we a few new mediums. So again, if we if we sort of look at this from a highlevel sort of look at this from a highlevel sort of look at this from a highlevel perspective, CVSS version 4 is perspective, CVSS version 4 is perspective, CVSS version 4 is different. These scores in the scores different. These scores in the scores different. These scores in the scores increase they increase not uniformly increase they increase not uniformly increase they increase not uniformly that over the whole range they do that over the whole range they do that over the whole range they do increase in general but there are some increase in general but there are some increase in general but there are some big shifts depending on classes of big shifts depending on classes of big shifts depending on classes of vulnerabilities and this change can be vulnerabilities and this change can be vulnerabilities and this change can be very disruptive depending on your very disruptive depending on your very disruptive depending on your organization the type of work that organization the type of work that organization the type of work that you're doing the decisions that you're you're doing the decisions that you're you're doing the decisions that you're basing you're using to to base on uh basing you're using to to base on uh basing you're using to to base on uh with CVSS they may change quite a uh and those score changes are are very uh and those score changes are are very uh and those score changes are are very dependent on the types of dependent on the types of dependent on the types of vulnerabilities in your environment. So what can you do about environment. So what can you do about environment. So what can you do about it? If you're a consumer, this is it? If you're a consumer, this is it? If you're a consumer, this is something that we're talking about in something that we're talking about in something that we're talking about in the CVSs a lot. You need to be very the CVSs a lot. You need to be very the CVSs a lot. You need to be very careful about basing your decisions only careful about basing your decisions only careful about basing your decisions only on the CVSS base score. All of what I've on the CVSS base score. All of what I've on the CVSS base score. All of what I've talked about is only the CVSS base score talked about is only the CVSS base score talked about is only the CVSS base score in version three and version in version three and version in version three and version four. I know it's difficult. We've had four. I know it's difficult. We've had four. I know it's difficult. We've had conversations about it, but because of conversations about it, but because of conversations about it, but because of the lack of context that exists in just the lack of context that exists in just the lack of context that exists in just the CVSS base score, it can be difficult the CVSS base score, it can be difficult the CVSS base score, it can be difficult to make riskbased decisions solely on to make riskbased decisions solely on to make riskbased decisions solely on that. to look at using the full vector that. to look at using the full vector that. to look at using the full vector string using base thread environmental string using base thread environmental string using base thread environmental to make better decisions in your own to make better decisions in your own to make better decisions in your own environment. But don't just rely on CVSS environment. But don't just rely on CVSS environment. But don't just rely on CVSS there are lots of other systems that can there are lots of other systems that can there are lots of other systems that can help to make decisions looking decisions help to make decisions looking decisions help to make decisions looking decisions especially risk based decisions on CVSS especially risk based decisions on CVSS especially risk based decisions on CVSS based scores based scores based scores um leaves a lot to be desired. There's um leaves a lot to be desired. There's um leaves a lot to be desired. There's also private systems such as Kenna, you also private systems such as Kenna, you also private systems such as Kenna, you know, other vendors that have their own know, other vendors that have their own know, other vendors that have their own uh ratings that help you decide in your uh ratings that help you decide in your uh ratings that help you decide in your own own own environment. If you're on the producer environment. If you're on the producer environment. If you're on the producer side, we should be careful of making side, we should be careful of making side, we should be careful of making promises based on CVSS. We've had lots promises based on CVSS. We've had lots promises based on CVSS. We've had lots of conversations about these scores of conversations about these scores of conversations about these scores being divorced from the reality in which being divorced from the reality in which being divorced from the reality in which they're or products are being deployed, they're or products are being deployed, they're or products are being deployed, mitigations, you know, things like that. mitigations, you know, things like that. mitigations, you know, things like that. you know, we can probably do better at you know, we can probably do better at you know, we can probably do better at describing how these systems uh really describing how these systems uh really describing how these systems uh really impact customer environments. Um, and we impact customer environments. Um, and we impact customer environments. Um, and we can hopefully as vendors, we can try to can hopefully as vendors, we can try to can hopefully as vendors, we can try to provide more context about what these provide more context about what these provide more context about what these mean so our customers can make better mean so our customers can make better mean so our customers can make better decisions. It's difficult for vendors to decisions. It's difficult for vendors to decisions. It's difficult for vendors to provide full base threaded environmental provide full base threaded environmental provide full base threaded environmental scores. We can at least help our scores. We can at least help our scores. We can at least help our consumers, our customers to understand consumers, our customers to understand consumers, our customers to understand how to do those things for themselves. how to do those things for themselves. how to do those things for themselves. give them as much information as they give them as much information as they give them as much information as they can. Qualitative ratings that we have can. Qualitative ratings that we have can. Qualitative ratings that we have are still very important. We need to are still very important. We need to are still very important. We need to start, you know, continue to rely on start, you know, continue to rely on start, you know, continue to rely on those. Our vendors, you know, we all those. Our vendors, you know, we all those. Our vendors, you know, we all have those things, right? We all have have those things, right? We all have have those things, right? We all have our own qualitative ratings. We should our own qualitative ratings. We should our own qualitative ratings. We should feel free to deviate from those policies feel free to deviate from those policies feel free to deviate from those policies when we say this is a 9.8, eight, but when we say this is a 9.8, eight, but when we say this is a 9.8, eight, but really it's more like a medium if we're really it's more like a medium if we're really it's more like a medium if we're looking at it um from a from a risk looking at it um from a from a risk looking at it um from a from a risk perspective. So, document that as part perspective. So, document that as part perspective. So, document that as part of your of your of your policy. Uh set criteria for how how you policy. Uh set criteria for how how you policy. Uh set criteria for how how you set qualitative ratings, but be prepared set qualitative ratings, but be prepared set qualitative ratings, but be prepared to document that and describe it when to document that and describe it when to document that and describe it when those things deviate from those ranges those things deviate from those ranges those things deviate from those ranges that are that are that are that are that are that are typical. And then really the the typical. And then really the the typical. And then really the the solution is using more of the vector solution is using more of the vector solution is using more of the vector string from both the consumer and the string from both the consumer and the string from both the consumer and the pro producer side being able to pro producer side being able to pro producer side being able to understand where those products sit in understand where those products sit in understand where those products sit in environments and be able to help our environments and be able to help our environments and be able to help our customers to make better riskbased customers to make better riskbased customers to make better riskbased decisions. So back to the end, the tool decisions. So back to the end, the tool decisions. So back to the end, the tool is out there. I encourage you if you're is out there. I encourage you if you're is out there. I encourage you if you're interested in V4 adoption, you want to interested in V4 adoption, you want to interested in V4 adoption, you want to look at how look at how look at how your vector strings you produce and use your vector strings you produce and use your vector strings you produce and use in your own in your own in your own environment are are impacting those environment are are impacting those environment are are impacting those things. It's on GitHub. The whole things. It's on GitHub. The whole things. It's on GitHub. The whole presentation's on presentation's on presentation's on GitHub. Um, you know, feel free to go GitHub. Um, you know, feel free to go GitHub. Um, you know, feel free to go try it. If you, you know, try it, you try it. If you, you know, try it, you try it.

Let me chat chat about it. Let me chat chat about it. Let me know if you want to go look at more know if you want to go look at more know if you want to go look at more CVSSI resources. first.orgcvss, come talk to me first at first.orgcvss, come talk to me first at first.orgcvss, come talk to me first at uh first at cvss.org. Questions about uh first at cvss.org. Questions about uh first at cvss.org. Questions about the standard, questions about the standard, questions about the standard, questions about this. You happy happy to talk about this. You happy happy to talk about this. You happy happy to talk about it. So, uh questions in the room, it. So, uh questions in the room, it. So, uh questions in the room, questions on Discord. I'm going to get a questions on Discord. I'm going to get a questions on Discord. I'm going to get a sip of water. sip of water. sip of water. Just to expand on Nick's last point, Just to expand on Nick's last point, Just to expand on Nick's last point, um it's been a mantra within the SIG for um it's been a mantra within the SIG for um it's been a mantra within the SIG for years. CVSS does not equal risk. Um you years. CVSS does not equal risk. Um you years. CVSS does not equal risk. Um you got to look at your environmental got to look at your environmental got to look at your environmental factors, your controls you got in place, factors, your controls you got in place, factors, your controls you got in place, uh the place those systems have in both uh the place those systems have in both uh the place those systems have in both the infrastructure or if you're talking the infrastructure or if you're talking the infrastructure or if you're talking products within the products. You know, products within the products. You know, products within the products. You know, we used to have a list of about a we used to have a list of about a we used to have a list of about a hundred checks we would go through on a hundred checks we would go through on a hundred checks we would go through on a CVSs, and this was back in V2 days, but CVSs, and this was back in V2 days, but CVSs, and this was back in V2 days, but back then we needed to do it more. Bruce is exactly right. Yeah. And and Bruce is exactly right. Yeah. And and Bruce is exactly right. Yeah. And and this is some of the guidance that we're this is some of the guidance that we're this is some of the guidance that we're trying to provide. And so, you know, to trying to provide. And so, you know, to trying to provide. And so, you know, to caveat all this caveat all this caveat all this is we we get a lot of questions in the is we we get a lot of questions in the is we we get a lot of questions in the SIG about CVSS base score, but what we, SIG about CVSS base score, but what we, SIG about CVSS base score, but what we, you know, it's we say to again not make you know, it's we say to again not make you know, it's we say to again not make riskbased decisions on CVSS base score. riskbased decisions on CVSS base score. riskbased decisions on CVSS base score. We're trying to move the ball down the We're trying to move the ball down the We're trying to move the ball down the field in that way a little bit. Yes. Yeah. Don't don't stat rank bit. Yes. Yeah. Don't don't stat rank bit. Yes. Yeah. Don't don't stat rank CVSS in your environment. The question was, do I environment. The question was, do I environment. The question was, do I understand the scoring understand the scoring understand the scoring inflation? Um, no. No, I don't. Um, I inflation? Um, no. No, I don't. Um, I inflation? Um, no. No, I don't. Um, I mean, part of the goal of the math under mean, part of the goal of the math under mean, part of the goal of the math under CVSs version 4 is to give more space for CVSs version 4 is to give more space for CVSs version 4 is to give more space for threat and threat and threat and environmental. And so really I think environmental. And so really I think environmental. And so really I think that is reflecting the the increase in that is reflecting the the increase in that is reflecting the the increase in score because what we wanted to do is score because what we wanted to do is score because what we wanted to do is shift base up and that leaves room more shift base up and that leaves room more shift base up and that leaves room more lower in the range for those markedup lower in the range for those markedup lower in the range for those markedup scores that scores that scores that have filled out thread and environmental have filled out thread and environmental have filled out thread and environmental because typically those will be moved because typically those will be moved because typically those will be moved down right so I think that's it's by down right so I think that's it's by down right so I think that's it's by design right so if you're talking about design right so if you're talking about design right so if you're talking about a worst case scenario where a base score a worst case scenario where a base score a worst case scenario where a base score doesn't change and it's been attacked doesn't change and it's been attacked doesn't change and it's been attacked and your confidentiality, integrity, and and your confidentiality, integrity, and and your confidentiality, integrity, and availability requirements are still very availability requirements are still very availability requirements are still very high and so you do all the threat and high and so you do all the threat and high and so you do all the threat and environmental markup and the score stays environmental markup and the score stays environmental markup and the score stays the same. It should stay very high, the same. It should stay very high, the same. It should stay very high, right? Because there's a serious impact right? Because there's a serious impact right? Because there's a serious impact and it's being exploited and that system and it's being exploited and that system and it's being exploited and that system really is important. So that's why some really is important. So that's why some really is important. So that's why some of those numbers are continue to be of those numbers are continue to be of those numbers are continue to be high. Yeah. high. Yeah. high. Yeah. Hey Nick, good morning. Uh I'm actually Hey Nick, good morning. Uh I'm actually Hey Nick, good morning. Uh I'm actually just interested in sort of a show of just interested in sort of a show of just interested in sort of a show of hands from the people in the room. How hands from the people in the room. How hands from the people in the room. How many people have adopted 4.0 or using it many people have adopted 4.0 or using it many people have adopted 4.0 or using it as part of their production operation? So there were only a very few hands. So there were only a very few hands. So there were only a very few hands. Any comments from any of you that raised Any comments from any of you that raised Any comments from any of you that raised your hands on challenges? Brian, you're preempting my next talk. Brian, you're preempting my next talk. Brian, you're preempting my next talk. Thank you for the I will slip you the $5 Thank you for the I will slip you the $5 Thank you for the I will slip you the $5 I owe you for that later. No, and we are trying to later. No, and we are trying to later. No, and we are trying to understand what some of those pain understand what some of those pain understand what some of those pain points for adoption are. And literally I points for adoption are. And literally I points for adoption are. And literally I have slides on that for that. Thank you. have slides on that for that. Thank you. have slides on that for that. Thank you. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. The the only thing that we have Yeah. The the only thing that we have Yeah. The the only thing that we have just to respond to his question is uh just to respond to his question is uh just to respond to his question is uh some of the things we did was converting some of the things we did was converting some of the things we did was converting old 3.1 to 4.0 and are going forward, old 3.1 to 4.0 and are going forward, old 3.1 to 4.0 and are going forward, but uh otherwise no, we've had no major but uh otherwise no, we've had no major but uh otherwise no, we've had no major concerns on using 4.0. Oh, it's been concerns on using 4.0. Oh, it's been concerns on using 4.0. Oh, it's been seamless. And for all my criticism about the And for all my criticism about the And for all my criticism about the numbers, I really do like the new numbers, I really do like the new numbers, I really do like the new standard. I think it adds a lot of standard. I think it adds a lot of standard. I think it adds a lot of context and and adds some nice features. context and and adds some nice features. context and and adds some nice features. So, you know, I think it's worth and I So, you know, I think it's worth and I So, you know, I think it's worth and I have a slide for the next part about is have a slide for the next part about is have a slide for the next part about is adoption worth it and I'll show you that shortly. Okay. Well, I'm going to hang shortly. Okay. Well, I'm going to hang shortly. Okay. Well, I'm going to hang out. I'm going to switch to, you know, out. I'm going to switch to, you know, out. I'm going to switch to, you know, talking about a little bit of updates talking about a little bit of updates talking about a little bit of updates from the CVSS SIG, what we've been from the CVSS SIG, what we've been from the CVSS SIG, what we've been working on, um, and, uh, you know, talk working on, um, and, uh, you know, talk working on, um, and, uh, you know, talk about V4 adoption and some of the about V4 adoption and some of the about V4 adoption and some of the challenges that we are that we are challenges that we are that we are challenges that we are that we are looking uh, to solve, uh, some of the looking uh, to solve, uh, some of the looking uh, to solve, uh, some of the things that we're working on to to help things that we're working on to to help things that we're working on to to help that. I'm just going to roll into the that. I'm just going to roll into the that. I'm just going to roll into the next part of it. next part of it. next part of it. So, I'm going to talk about what we've So, I'm going to talk about what we've So, I'm going to talk about what we've been doing in the last year since we been doing in the last year since we been doing in the last year since we were here last year at Volcon. were here last year at Volcon. were here last year at Volcon. um what we've been you know uh or or um what we've been you know uh or or um what we've been you know uh or or really some of the data some of some of really some of the data some of some of really some of the data some of some of um what CVS4 how CVSS4 has developed in um what CVS4 how CVSS4 has developed in um what CVS4 how CVSS4 has developed in the last year what the SIG has worked on the last year what the SIG has worked on the last year what the SIG has worked on and we're running a survey and I want to and we're running a survey and I want to and we're running a survey and I want to talk about some of the survey what some talk about some of the survey what some talk about some of the survey what some of those challenges to CVSS adoption of those challenges to CVSS adoption of those challenges to CVSS adoption CVSS version 4 adoption have been how CVSS version 4 adoption have been how CVSS version 4 adoption have been how people like it how people don't like it people like it how people don't like it people like it how people don't like it there are a lot of opinions and I think there are a lot of opinions and I think there are a lot of opinions and I think that's great and then what we're the SIG that's great and then what we're the SIG that's great and then what we're the SIG is looking forward and doing uh here in is looking forward and doing uh here in is looking forward and doing uh here in the near future. If you heard Rob Arnold the near future. If you heard Rob Arnold the near future. If you heard Rob Arnold talk this morning about his UC2 risk talk this morning about his UC2 risk talk this morning about his UC2 risk ruler for CVSS version 4 talking about ruler for CVSS version 4 talking about ruler for CVSS version 4 talking about um trying to have a a new CVSs guide. um trying to have a a new CVSs guide. um trying to have a a new CVSs guide. We're calling it enhanced user guide, We're calling it enhanced user guide, We're calling it enhanced user guide, but it's really like an implementation but it's really like an implementation but it's really like an implementation guide. It's about how vulnerability guide. It's about how vulnerability guide. It's about how vulnerability managers can use CVSS in their managers can use CVSS in their managers can use CVSS in their environment, enrich their their environment, enrich their their environment, enrich their their programs, mature their programs to use programs, mature their programs to use programs, mature their programs to use CVSS at a higher level and to get CVSS CVSS at a higher level and to get CVSS CVSS at a higher level and to get CVSS to that place to start making better to that place to start making better to that place to start making better risk based risk based risk based decisions. Already showed this. So, you decisions. Already showed this. So, you decisions. Already showed this. So, you know, this is some of the members of the know, this is some of the members of the know, this is some of the members of the CVSS SIG who've been, you know, very CVSS SIG who've been, you know, very CVSS SIG who've been, you know, very active participate. You know, there's a active participate. You know, there's a active participate. You know, there's a lot of people who are very passionate lot of people who are very passionate lot of people who are very passionate about CVSS, who help every week trying about CVSS, who help every week trying about CVSS, who help every week trying to develop the standard, trying to to develop the standard, trying to to develop the standard, trying to update our documentation, who want to update our documentation, who want to update our documentation, who want to try to answer questions, and it's really try to answer questions, and it's really try to answer questions, and it's really a group effort. There are a lot of a group effort. There are a lot of a group effort. There are a lot of passionate people who care about CVSS, passionate people who care about CVSS, passionate people who care about CVSS, who are trying to make it better, and who are trying to make it better, and who are trying to make it better, and all of the people who are using CVSS, all of the people who are using CVSS, all of the people who are using CVSS, who reach out to us, to ask questions, who reach out to us, to ask questions, who reach out to us, to ask questions, to provide feedback. Thank you. Thank to provide feedback. Thank you. Thank to provide feedback. Thank you. Thank you to everyone. You know, it really is you to everyone. You know, it really is you to everyone. You know, it really is a group effort. It's a great group of a group effort. It's a great group of a group effort. It's a great group of people who argue all the time like a people who argue all the time like a people who argue all the time like a family and kind of have heated family and kind of have heated family and kind of have heated arguments, but are all trying to work arguments, but are all trying to work arguments, but are all trying to work together to move this standard forward. together to move this standard forward. together to move this standard forward. So, thank you. Thank you to all of the So, thank you. Thank you to all of the So, thank you. Thank you to all of the SIG SIG SIG members. So, in the past year, again, members. So, in the past year, again, members. So, in the past year, again, CVSS was released 2023. CVSS was released 2023. CVSS was released 2023. In the past year, we've In the past year, we've In the past year, we've had thousands and thousands, like I had thousands and thousands, like I had thousands and thousands, like I talked before about some of the data talked before about some of the data talked before about some of the data that that I use as part of my talk, that that I use as part of my talk, that that I use as part of my talk, thousands of produced CVSS version 4 thousands of produced CVSS version 4 thousands of produced CVSS version 4 vectors. We have the CVE program and NVD vectors. We have the CVE program and NVD vectors. We have the CVE program and NVD supporting version 4 in their in their supporting version 4 in their in their supporting version 4 in their in their schema. Um, the CVE program themselves schema. Um, the CVE program themselves schema. Um, the CVE program themselves have almost 5,000 V4 vectors. I pulled have almost 5,000 V4 vectors. I pulled have almost 5,000 V4 vectors. I pulled this data a couple weeks ago. It's this data a couple weeks ago. It's this data a couple weeks ago. It's probably over 5,000 CVSS version 4 probably over 5,000 CVSS version 4 probably over 5,000 CVSS version 4 vectors at this vectors at this vectors at this point. GitHub has going on 10,000. point. GitHub has going on 10,000. point. GitHub has going on 10,000. Again, you know, they're big early Again, you know, they're big early Again, you know, they're big early adopter. They've had very good things to adopter. They've had very good things to adopter. They've had very good things to say about CVSS version 4. It works very say about CVSS version 4. It works very say about CVSS version 4. It works very well for their their use and well for their their use and well for their their use and they've really adopted it and and they've really adopted it and and they've really adopted it and and provide so many many provide so many many provide so many many scores in the CVE program. We see 56 scores in the CVE program. We see 56 scores in the CVE program. We see 56 unique advent 56 unique vendors who have unique advent 56 unique vendors who have unique advent 56 unique vendors who have provided CVSS version 4 scores in the provided CVSS version 4 scores in the provided CVSS version 4 scores in the CVE program database. CVE program database. CVE program database. The biggest by far is V DB followed by The biggest by far is V DB followed by The biggest by far is V DB followed by Juniper, Intel, Seammens and severalerts Juniper, Intel, Seammens and severalerts Juniper, Intel, Seammens and severalerts including CISA and ICSEert C all who including CISA and ICSEert C all who including CISA and ICSEert C all who provide version 4 provide version 4 provide version 4 metrics and again the biggest by far is metrics and again the biggest by far is metrics and again the biggest by far is GitHub with over 7,000 now probably GitHub with over 7,000 now probably GitHub with over 7,000 now probably 8,000 CVSS vectors. Um, and I talked 8,000 CVSS vectors. Um, and I talked 8,000 CVSS vectors. Um, and I talked about some of those those numbers about some of those those numbers about some of those those numbers earlier. So, in the last year, we've earlier. So, in the last year, we've earlier. So, in the last year, we've continued to work on all of our continued to work on all of our continued to work on all of our documentation updates. We've worked on documentation updates. We've worked on documentation updates. We've worked on our examples document. I'm personally our examples document. I'm personally our examples document. I'm personally passionate about that and this is a call passionate about that and this is a call passionate about that and this is a call to everyone uh in the room or seeing to everyone uh in the room or seeing to everyone uh in the room or seeing this. If you have examples, if you have this. If you have examples, if you have this. If you have examples, if you have examples that you think are interesting examples that you think are interesting examples that you think are interesting that you would like to see, if there are that you would like to see, if there are that you would like to see, if there are some that are wrong, I will fully admit some that are wrong, I will fully admit some that are wrong, I will fully admit that they are wrong. You know, nobody's that they are wrong. You know, nobody's that they are wrong. You know, nobody's perfect, but if you have suggestions, perfect, but if you have suggestions, perfect, but if you have suggestions, feedback on that examples document, send feedback on that examples document, send feedback on that examples document, send them my way. I'm happy to update it. I them my way. I'm happy to update it. I them my way. I'm happy to update it. I added a new um kind of a rotating added a new um kind of a rotating added a new um kind of a rotating section looking at vulnerabilities in section looking at vulnerabilities in section looking at vulnerabilities in the CISA Kev. So I'm providing um the CISA Kev. So I'm providing um the CISA Kev. So I'm providing um examples that a version four example for examples that a version four example for examples that a version four example for a vulnerability that appears in the at a vulnerability that appears in the at a vulnerability that appears in the at the top of the CICv when I when I do the top of the CICv when I when I do the top of the CICv when I when I do updates. So I've updated the examples updates. So I've updated the examples updates. So I've updated the examples docu uh three times this calendar year docu uh three times this calendar year docu uh three times this calendar year with a number of examples updates for with a number of examples updates for with a number of examples updates for server side request forgery cross-sight server side request forgery cross-sight server side request forgery cross-sight request forgery the regression uh request forgery the regression uh request forgery the regression uh vulnerability trying to clarify examples vulnerability trying to clarify examples vulnerability trying to clarify examples around subsequent system around subsequent system around subsequent system updates adding that CIS Kevv example updates adding that CIS Kevv example updates adding that CIS Kevv example examples to cross- site scripting and examples to cross- site scripting and examples to cross- site scripting and we're trying to add more threat and we're trying to add more threat and we're trying to add more threat and environmental examples in the environmental examples in the environmental examples in the documentation to show how consumers of documentation to show how consumers of documentation to show how consumers of CVSS can enrich their own CVSS vectors CVSS can enrich their own CVSS vectors CVSS can enrich their own CVSS vectors by providing those those threat and by providing those those threat and by providing those those threat and environmental vectors and more environmental vectors and more environmental vectors and more importantly through the examples importantly through the examples importantly through the examples understand the decision points that that understand the decision points that that understand the decision points that that are need to be made and then the the are need to be made and then the the are need to be made and then the the information that you need to gather from information that you need to gather from information that you need to gather from your own environment where that threat your own environment where that threat your own environment where that threat information can come from where that information can come from where that information can come from where that environmental the the makeup of the environmental the the makeup of the environmental the the makeup of the systems the value of the systems in your systems the value of the systems in your systems the value of the systems in your environment and how to make those environment and how to make those environment and how to make those decisions and how to generate those decisions and how to generate those decisions and how to generate those enriched vector strings for your own enriched vector strings for your own enriched vector strings for your own environment. We've updated the FAQ with environment. We've updated the FAQ with environment. We've updated the FAQ with a number of uh new resources. The the a number of uh new resources. The the a number of uh new resources. The the item I added about the why of the math item I added about the why of the math item I added about the why of the math uh earlier uh in in 2024 was really uh earlier uh in in 2024 was really uh earlier uh in in 2024 was really around some of these questions about how around some of these questions about how around some of these questions about how the math changes in version 4 and added the math changes in version 4 and added the math changes in version 4 and added some more information about that. We some more information about that. We some more information about that. We added some information about uh how to added some information about uh how to added some information about uh how to create your own CVS calculator, how to create your own CVS calculator, how to create your own CVS calculator, how to use existing libraries use existing libraries use existing libraries um to to make your own. There's lots of um to to make your own. There's lots of um to to make your own. There's lots of uh really cool exciting ports of those uh really cool exciting ports of those uh really cool exciting ports of those libraries that have been made for libraries that have been made for libraries that have been made for different languages. Uh that's available different languages. Uh that's available different languages. Uh that's available on our resources uh on our resources uh on our resources uh repo. And then most recently, we added repo. And then most recently, we added repo. And then most recently, we added FAQ about how vendors should be doing FAQ about how vendors should be doing FAQ about how vendors should be doing reassessment. So a vulnerability that is reassessment. So a vulnerability that is reassessment. So a vulnerability that is in a library or component that they in a library or component that they in a library or component that they consume, they provide a unique consume, they provide a unique consume, they provide a unique assessment for that the impact of that assessment for that the impact of that assessment for that the impact of that vulnerability on their own systems vulnerability on their own systems vulnerability on their own systems because there was a blog post by Curl because there was a blog post by Curl because there was a blog post by Curl reading CVSS is dead to us and that reading CVSS is dead to us and that reading CVSS is dead to us and that really set me off. So I'm like, you really set me off. So I'm like, you really set me off. So I'm like, you know, I I I know, I I I know, I I I identify and I I agree with Daniel. identify and I I agree with Daniel. identify and I I agree with Daniel. There are challenges in how some people There are challenges in how some people There are challenges in how some people implement CVSS and I'm sorry that CVSS implement CVSS and I'm sorry that CVSS implement CVSS and I'm sorry that CVSS is dead to them. I understand the is dead to them. I understand the is dead to them. I understand the concern but really there are lots of concern but really there are lots of concern but really there are lots of vendors who are understanding how vendors who are understanding how vendors who are understanding how vulnerabilities impact their own systems vulnerabilities impact their own systems vulnerabilities impact their own systems and then are providing unique and then are providing unique and then are providing unique assessments to their own assessments to their own assessments to their own products and we're trying to provide products and we're trying to provide products and we're trying to provide some guidance around that. What I'd like some guidance around that. What I'd like some guidance around that. What I'd like to do and I, you know, I'm trying to to do and I, you know, I'm trying to to do and I, you know, I'm trying to corner people this week from the CVE corner people this week from the CVE corner people this week from the CVE program and from NVD about how we can program and from NVD about how we can program and from NVD about how we can represent that in vulnerability represent that in vulnerability represent that in vulnerability databases. How we can say if this databases. How we can say if this databases. How we can say if this OpenSSL vulnerability OpenSSL vulnerability OpenSSL vulnerability impacts systems broadly, there's one CVS impacts systems broadly, there's one CVS impacts systems broadly, there's one CVS assessment, but it may be different on assessment, but it may be different on assessment, but it may be different on Red Hat Enterprise Linux. It may be Red Hat Enterprise Linux. It may be Red Hat Enterprise Linux. It may be different on Microsoft Windows. It may different on Microsoft Windows. It may different on Microsoft Windows. It may be different on Cisco IOS XE. So, it's be different on Cisco IOS XE. So, it's be different on Cisco IOS XE. So, it's dependent on the platform. And I'd like dependent on the platform. And I'd like dependent on the platform. And I'd like to see where we can get to a world where to see where we can get to a world where to see where we can get to a world where we have per platform assessments for CVE we have per platform assessments for CVE we have per platform assessments for CVE that can change that CVSS score to be that can change that CVSS score to be that can change that CVSS score to be unique to a platform. So we can get unique to a platform. So we can get unique to a platform. So we can get closer to having, you know, even if we closer to having, you know, even if we closer to having, you know, even if we can't make threat and environmental can't make threat and environmental can't make threat and environmental metrics for all of our customers, we can metrics for all of our customers, we can metrics for all of our customers, we can at least get a more appropriate base CVS at least get a more appropriate base CVS at least get a more appropriate base CVS score for those products that we produce score for those products that we produce score for those products that we produce and consume. So that's the latest update and consume. So that's the latest update and consume. So that's the latest update that we did to the FAQ. that we did to the FAQ. that we did to the FAQ. Lots of tooling support has come out in Lots of tooling support has come out in Lots of tooling support has come out in the last year. Again, CVE program in NVD the last year. Again, CVE program in NVD the last year. Again, CVE program in NVD have have added support for that. Uh the have have added support for that. Uh the have have added support for that. Uh the Red Hat library that underlies the Red Hat library that underlies the Red Hat library that underlies the calculator on CVSS uh the CVSS site at calculator on CVSS uh the CVSS site at calculator on CVSS uh the CVSS site at first.org. It's been updated, improved. first.org. It's been updated, improved. first.org. It's been updated, improved. If you are interested in incorporating If you are interested in incorporating If you are interested in incorporating CVSS version 4 functionality in your own CVSS version 4 functionality in your own CVSS version 4 functionality in your own software, it's free to use. Go grab it. software, it's free to use. Go grab it. software, it's free to use. Go grab it. There are many more thirdparty tools to There are many more thirdparty tools to There are many more thirdparty tools to support CVSS version 4. Stephen Schaefer support CVSS version 4. Stephen Schaefer support CVSS version 4. Stephen Schaefer talked about his CVSSBT. He added talked about his CVSSBT. He added talked about his CVSSBT. He added support for for version 4. We link that support for for version 4. We link that support for for version 4. We link that on our resources guide. We have other uh on our resources guide. We have other uh on our resources guide. We have other uh resources on the CVSS uh sources repo resources on the CVSS uh sources repo resources on the CVSS uh sources repo for testing and creating your own tools. for testing and creating your own tools. for testing and creating your own tools. So all of this is really about how we So all of this is really about how we So all of this is really about how we can help to support and and improve can help to support and and improve can help to support and and improve adoption of version adoption of version adoption of version 4. And so we started to get some 4. And so we started to get some 4. And so we started to get some concerns about version 4 adoption. And concerns about version 4 adoption. And concerns about version 4 adoption. And anecdotally, you know, we don't know and anecdotally, you know, we don't know and anecdotally, you know, we don't know and I haven't gone back and compared at what I haven't gone back and compared at what I haven't gone back and compared at what point in time how many version three point in time how many version three point in time how many version three scores existed to now and version four. scores existed to now and version four. scores existed to now and version four. you know, we, you know, have concerns of you know, we, you know, have concerns of you know, we, you know, have concerns of course when you have put your little course when you have put your little course when you have put your little baby out in the world and you're hoping baby out in the world and you're hoping baby out in the world and you're hoping it grows up big and strong, but I, you it grows up big and strong, but I, you it grows up big and strong, but I, you know, I don't know if it's maturing at know, I don't know if it's maturing at know, I don't know if it's maturing at the same rate as version three did, the same rate as version three did, the same rate as version three did, right? So, we started the CVSS survey right? So, we started the CVSS survey right? So, we started the CVSS survey and we are really concerned about what and we are really concerned about what and we are really concerned about what are some of the pain points, what are are some of the pain points, what are are some of the pain points, what are the adoption rates, and really how can the adoption rates, and really how can the adoption rates, and really how can we improve what we're doing to help we improve what we're doing to help we improve what we're doing to help consumers and producers use version 4 in consumers and producers use version 4 in consumers and producers use version 4 in their environments. So I'll talk about their environments. So I'll talk about their environments. So I'll talk about some of those some of those some of those results might give you some confidence results might give you some confidence results might give you some confidence if you're not using version 4 and you if you're not using version 4 and you if you're not using version 4 and you want to move to it or maybe you're like want to move to it or maybe you're like want to move to it or maybe you're like ah never mind I'll wait for version ah never mind I'll wait for version ah never mind I'll wait for version five. Let's talk about some of those five. Let's talk about some of those five. Let's talk about some of those those results. So we've had um over 500 those results. So we've had um over 500 those results. So we've had um over 500 responses since uh September 2024. If responses since uh September 2024. If responses since uh September 2024. If you haven't taken the survey or if you haven't taken the survey or if you haven't taken the survey or if you're curious it's in the Discord. I you're curious it's in the Discord. I you're curious it's in the Discord. I put a link in there. It's also available put a link in there. It's also available put a link in there. It's also available on CVSS uh the CVS sitefirst.org/cvss. on CVSS uh the CVS sitefirst.org/cvss. on CVSS uh the CVS sitefirst.org/cvss. /cvss. So over 500 responses at the last /cvss. So over 500 responses at the last /cvss. So over 500 responses at the last time I I looked at this. So among and we time I I looked at this. So among and we time I I looked at this. So among and we asked a number of questions, but the the asked a number of questions, but the the asked a number of questions, but the the main question we we asked was is CVSS main question we we asked was is CVSS main question we we asked was is CVSS version 4 worth it? Do you think the version 4 worth it? Do you think the version 4 worth it? Do you think the transition from version three to version transition from version three to version transition from version three to version 4 or at least some form of adoption of 4 or at least some form of adoption of 4 or at least some form of adoption of version 4 in your environment is worth version 4 in your environment is worth version 4 in your environment is worth it? it? it? 24 26% said, "Nah, I'm good. I'm good 24 26% said, "Nah, I'm good. I'm good 24 26% said, "Nah, I'm good. I'm good with 2.0 or with 2.0 or with 2.0 or whatever." But 74% of all respondents whatever." But 74% of all respondents whatever." But 74% of all respondents said, "Yeah, yeah, we think version 4 is said, "Yeah, yeah, we think version 4 is said, "Yeah, yeah, we think version 4 is worth worth worth it." Now, it." Now, it." Now, curiously, among those who reported no curiously, among those who reported no curiously, among those who reported no usage of version 4, half said, "No, usage of version 4, half said, "No, usage of version 4, half said, "No, thank you. Not worth it." And half said, thank you. Not worth it." And half said, thank you. Not worth it." And half said, "Yeah, we think it's worth it." So "Yeah, we think it's worth it." So "Yeah, we think it's worth it." So that's if they have no self-reported that's if they have no self-reported that's if they have no self-reported uses of of version 4. uses of of version 4. uses of of version 4. However, if you're a consumer on the However, if you're a consumer on the However, if you're a consumer on the left or a producer of version 4, as you left or a producer of version 4, as you left or a producer of version 4, as you reported in the tool, overwhelmingly reported in the tool, overwhelmingly reported in the tool, overwhelmingly organizations who've adopted version 4 organizations who've adopted version 4 organizations who've adopted version 4 like it, especially if you're a like it, especially if you're a like it, especially if you're a producer. 85% of producers who use and producer. 85% of producers who use and producer. 85% of producers who use and produce version 4 say it was worth the produce version 4 say it was worth the produce version 4 say it was worth the effort. a little smaller on the consumer effort. a little smaller on the consumer effort. a little smaller on the consumer side, but 77% say they were it was worth side, but 77% say they were it was worth side, but 77% say they were it was worth it. Now, this is a survey about CVSS it. Now, this is a survey about CVSS it. Now, this is a survey about CVSS version 4. And there may be some bias version 4. And there may be some bias version 4. And there may be some bias here. If you move to version 4, you want here. If you move to version 4, you want here. If you move to version 4, you want to be like, "Yeah, it was great even to be like, "Yeah, it was great even to be like, "Yeah, it was great even though it was terrible." Um, so, you though it was terrible." Um, so, you though it was terrible." Um, so, you know, kind of take that uh with a grain know, kind of take that uh with a grain know, kind of take that uh with a grain of salt. But you know it seems like of salt. But you know it seems like of salt. But you know it seems like people who have moved to version 4 like people who have moved to version 4 like people who have moved to version 4 like version 4. But there are some challenges version 4. But there are some challenges version 4. But there are some challenges to it and we understand that. So we to it and we understand that. So we to it and we understand that. So we asked some asked some asked some questions and this is questions and this is questions and this is um the blue here is if it's a a um the blue here is if it's a a um the blue here is if it's a a publisher, orange is a publisher, the publisher, orange is a publisher, the publisher, orange is a publisher, the middle column is a publisher of version middle column is a publisher of version middle column is a publisher of version 4 and then the right hand column the 4 and then the right hand column the 4 and then the right hand column the green is consumer. So these are all the green is consumer. So these are all the green is consumer. So these are all the challenges to version 4 and challenges to version 4 and challenges to version 4 and really it's not important to look at really it's not important to look at really it's not important to look at every specific one but there's no one every specific one but there's no one every specific one but there's no one that is the reason that is the that is that is the reason that is the that is that is the reason that is the that is blocking adoption of version 4. There blocking adoption of version 4. There blocking adoption of version 4. There are lots of reasons. It's hard. It takes are lots of reasons. It's hard. It takes are lots of reasons. It's hard. It takes time. The tools aren't there. The time. The tools aren't there. The time. The tools aren't there. The standards aren't there. Uh other things standards aren't there. Uh other things standards aren't there. Uh other things that rely on it. Lack of demand. It's that rely on it. Lack of demand. It's that rely on it. Lack of demand. It's sort of a chicken and egg thing. If sort of a chicken and egg thing. If sort of a chicken and egg thing. If nobody asks for it, you're not going to nobody asks for it, you're not going to nobody asks for it, you're not going to do it. but you're not going to do it if do it. but you're not going to do it if do it. but you're not going to do it if nobody asks for it. Uh it's hard. So nobody asks for it. Uh it's hard. So nobody asks for it. Uh it's hard. So there are lots of reasons why CVSS there are lots of reasons why CVSS there are lots of reasons why CVSS version 4 adoption may seem to be version 4 adoption may seem to be version 4 adoption may seem to be lagging. lagging. lagging. So we're trying to improve some of these So we're trying to improve some of these So we're trying to improve some of these things and and helping to produce things and and helping to produce things and and helping to produce tooling to produce guidance examples tooling to produce guidance examples tooling to produce guidance examples uh this implementation guide that we're uh this implementation guide that we're uh this implementation guide that we're talking about to help talking about to help talking about to help organiz 4 or just use CVSS in a more organiz 4 or just use CVSS in a more organiz 4 or just use CVSS in a more mature way in their own environments. mature way in their own environments. mature way in their own environments. But is CVS version 4 adoption slow? But is CVS version 4 adoption slow? But is CVS version 4 adoption slow? This shows among respondents what This shows among respondents what This shows among respondents what version of ver CVSS they're using. Now version of ver CVSS they're using. Now version of ver CVSS they're using. Now this poll was about CVSS version 4. So this poll was about CVSS version 4. So this poll was about CVSS version 4. So maybe it's not surprising but there are maybe it's not surprising but there are maybe it's not surprising but there are still a lot of respondents who reported still a lot of respondents who reported still a lot of respondents who reported use of version 4. Almost half of use of version 4. Almost half of use of version 4. Almost half of respondents to the poll said they are respondents to the poll said they are respondents to the poll said they are using version 4 and that's more than any using version 4 and that's more than any using version 4 and that's more than any other version of the standard. There's other version of the standard. There's other version of the standard. There's still a long tale on version two. still a long tale on version two. still a long tale on version two. Actually, you know, quite a few users of Actually, you know, quite a few users of Actually, you know, quite a few users of version two, but also version three, version two, but also version three, version two, but also version three, version four. So, lots of versions of version four. So, lots of versions of version four. So, lots of versions of the standard are being used in lots of the standard are being used in lots of the standard are being used in lots of environments. So, I'm just curious, you environments. So, I'm just curious, you environments. So, I'm just curious, you know, by show of know, by show of know, by show of hands, anybody willing to admit they're hands, anybody willing to admit they're hands, anybody willing to admit they're still using version still using version still using version two? I don't see any hand. Okay. Lot two? I don't see any hand. Okay. Lot two? I don't see any hand. Okay. Lot some people reported it. How about are some people reported it. How about are some people reported it. How about are you still on version three? Okay. Yeah. And are you a version Okay. Yeah. And are you a version Okay. Yeah. And are you a version four? All right. So, a bit of a mix. four? All right. So, a bit of a mix. four? All right. So, a bit of a mix. Yeah. And and really that's that's the Yeah. And and really that's that's the Yeah. And and really that's that's the message here from the survey is message here from the survey is message here from the survey is that there's a lot of different versions that there's a lot of different versions that there's a lot of different versions of CVSS that are being used of CVSS that are being used of CVSS that are being used concurrently. But it's not just concurrently. But it's not just concurrently. But it's not just CVSS. CVS does not work in a vacuum. CVSS. CVS does not work in a vacuum. CVSS. CVS does not work in a vacuum. Most respondents are using CVSS in Most respondents are using CVSS in Most respondents are using CVSS in concert with other scoring and valuation concert with other scoring and valuation concert with other scoring and valuation systems in their own systems in their own systems in their own environment. Out of our 500 respondents, environment. Out of our 500 respondents, environment. Out of our 500 respondents, 37% use two or more systems. And this is 37% use two or more systems. And this is 37% use two or more systems. And this is a little bit hard to see, but you can a little bit hard to see, but you can a little bit hard to see, but you can look at it in detail if you download the look at it in detail if you download the look at it in detail if you download the slides. But really, the takeaway here is slides. But really, the takeaway here is slides. But really, the takeaway here is that everybody uses CVSS and other that everybody uses CVSS and other that everybody uses CVSS and other systems in combination. So, I know we systems in combination. So, I know we systems in combination. So, I know we sort of talked about nobody should stack sort of talked about nobody should stack sort of talked about nobody should stack rank CVSS vectors and just use that, but rank CVSS vectors and just use that, but rank CVSS vectors and just use that, but that's not what most organizations are that's not what most organizations are that's not what most organizations are doing, at least among the respondents of doing, at least among the respondents of doing, at least among the respondents of the the the survey. They're using SSVC, survey. They're using SSVC, survey. They're using SSVC, EPSS, the vendor and assessments that EPSS, the vendor and assessments that EPSS, the vendor and assessments that are provide the assessments that are are provide the assessments that are are provide the assessments that are provided by their vendor, those provided by their vendor, those provided by their vendor, those qualitative boundaries and even their qualitative boundaries and even their qualitative boundaries and even their own internal systems. So there's a lot own internal systems. So there's a lot own internal systems. So there's a lot who are using internally developed who are using internally developed who are using internally developed systems along with these other systems along with these other systems along with these other standards. So there's a big group of standards. So there's a big group of standards. So there's a big group of organizations who are using multiple organizations who are using multiple organizations who are using multiple data points and that's great. Yeah. See data points and that's great. Yeah. See data points and that's great. Yeah. See they these are all very complimentary they these are all very complimentary they these are all very complimentary and they should be used al and they should be used al and they should be used al together. So what we're trying to use is together. So what we're trying to use is together. So what we're trying to use is the results of that survey to guide some the results of that survey to guide some the results of that survey to guide some of our efforts in the SIG moving of our efforts in the SIG moving of our efforts in the SIG moving forward. I talked about this enhanced forward. I talked about this enhanced forward. I talked about this enhanced user guide. It's a guide for those who user guide. It's a guide for those who user guide. It's a guide for those who are implementing vulnerability are implementing vulnerability are implementing vulnerability management systems and they're using management systems and they're using management systems and they're using CVSS in their environment to level up CVSS in their environment to level up CVSS in their environment to level up their use of CVSS. How to take that base their use of CVSS. How to take that base their use of CVSS. How to take that base score add threat environmental score add threat environmental score add threat environmental supplemental and get closer to making supplemental and get closer to making supplemental and get closer to making riskbased decisions in their riskbased decisions in their riskbased decisions in their environment. But we're trying to provide environment. But we're trying to provide environment. But we're trying to provide some concrete guidance around that. And some concrete guidance around that. And some concrete guidance around that. And we're also looking at examples and we're also looking at examples and we're also looking at examples and further further further documentation providing more examples documentation providing more examples documentation providing more examples about CVSS enrichment. I talked about about CVSS enrichment. I talked about about CVSS enrichment. I talked about that per pl product assessment. I would that per pl product assessment. I would that per pl product assessment. I would like to get to where we are seeing like to get to where we are seeing like to get to where we are seeing CVSSam CVSSam CVSSam uh CVSS assessments on a per platform uh CVSS assessments on a per platform uh CVSS assessments on a per platform basis. We're starting down that road. basis. We're starting down that road. basis. We're starting down that road. And you know I joked about version five. And you know I joked about version five. And you know I joked about version five. I don't we're not going to see version I don't we're not going to see version I don't we're not going to see version 4.1 anytime soon. You know, we 4.1 anytime soon. You know, we 4.1 anytime soon. You know, we understand it takes time to transition understand it takes time to transition understand it takes time to transition things. We don't want to rock the boat. things. We don't want to rock the boat. things. We don't want to rock the boat. We won't see version 4 this calendar We won't see version 4 this calendar We won't see version 4 this calendar year. If version 4 comes out sometime in year. If version 4 comes out sometime in year. If version 4 comes out sometime in 2026, it'll be a documentation update. 2026, it'll be a documentation update. 2026, it'll be a documentation update. It'll be just like version 3.1. It'll be It'll be just like version 3.1. It'll be It'll be just like version 3.1. It'll be interchangeable. Uh and it will really interchangeable. Uh and it will really interchangeable. Uh and it will really just to be about clarifying those just to be about clarifying those just to be about clarifying those documentation pieces to to make it documentation pieces to to make it documentation pieces to to make it clearer, make better decisions about how clearer, make better decisions about how clearer, make better decisions about how to produce and consume CVSS.
