It's just me talking about my experience in the past talking about my experience in the past talking about my experience in the past year dealing with these circumstances year dealing with these circumstances year dealing with these circumstances and what hopefully will be a seed for and what hopefully will be a seed for and what hopefully will be a seed for something that will come perhaps Vcon something that will come perhaps Vcon something that will come perhaps Vcon 2026. I generally said that my slides 2026. I generally said that my slides 2026. I generally said that my slides were ugly but made with love. Now were ugly but made with love. Now were ugly but made with love. Now they're a bit less ugly. Only a bit they're a bit less ugly. Only a bit they're a bit less ugly. Only a bit because I use some AI magic and even because I use some AI magic and even because I use some AI magic and even more love just to make it a bit more more love just to make it a bit more more love just to make it a bit more palatable. And of course as obvious palatable. And of course as obvious palatable. And of course as obvious anecdotes are not data. you have anecdotes are not data. you have anecdotes are not data. you have surprisingly little data about the surprisingly little data about the surprisingly little data about the things that I'm going to talk about but things that I'm going to talk about but things that I'm going to talk about but they reflect my perspective and from the they reflect my perspective and from the they reflect my perspective and from the position where I sit in the ecosystem of position where I sit in the ecosystem of position where I sit in the ecosystem of the things that I observed everything the things that I observed everything the things that I observed everything else the data should be accurate except else the data should be accurate except else the data should be accurate except when I'm using hyperbole for the purpose when I'm using hyperbole for the purpose when I'm using hyperbole for the purpose of flare that should be very obvious so of flare that should be very obvious so of flare that should be very obvious so let's get started first off where do we let's get started first off where do we let's get started first off where do we sit in the ecosystem the open source sit in the ecosystem the open source sit in the ecosystem the open source ecosystem is ever growing and the ecosystem is ever growing and the ecosystem is ever growing and the seconds that I've started since the seconds that I've started since the seconds that I've started since the beginning of this sentence more and more beginning of this sentence more and more beginning of this sentence more and more packages have appeared more and more packages have appeared more and more packages have appeared more and more packages have began to be used and all packages have began to be used and all packages have began to be used and all the studies even the study from the open the studies even the study from the open the studies even the study from the open SSF is shows that like a overwhelming SSF is shows that like a overwhelming SSF is shows that like a overwhelming almost complete percentage of software almost complete percentage of software almost complete percentage of software that is being used right now even the that is being used right now even the that is being used right now even the same software that is on this device same software that is on this device same software that is on this device that is showing my slides uses some part that is showing my slides uses some part that is showing my slides uses some part of open source components. It is Windows of open source components. It is Windows of open source components. It is Windows but it still has some open source in it. but it still has some open source in it. but it still has some open source in it. Open source is pretty much everywhere. Open source is pretty much everywhere. Open source is pretty much everywhere. As we look towards the ecosystems, you As we look towards the ecosystems, you As we look towards the ecosystems, you can see that continues to be an can see that continues to be an can see that continues to be an exponential or overexponential growth exponential or overexponential growth exponential or overexponential growth like the number of packages that are like the number of packages that are like the number of packages that are being added every day make determining being added every day make determining being added every day make determining how many packages we have a veritable how many packages we have a veritable how many packages we have a veritable moving target. In this in the instant moving target. In this in the instant moving target. In this in the instant that you calculate how many packages that you calculate how many packages that you calculate how many packages exist in npm or in Maven Central or any exist in npm or in Maven Central or any exist in npm or in Maven Central or any other of the other um spaces, you've other of the other um spaces, you've other of the other um spaces, you've already that number is already outdated already that number is already outdated already that number is already outdated and does milliseconds. a bunch of other and does milliseconds. a bunch of other and does milliseconds. a bunch of other packages have been added. So package packages have been added. So package packages have been added. So package growth keeps growing growing growing growth keeps growing growing growing growth keeps growing growing growing growing as well. This is for example um growing as well. This is for example um growing as well. This is for example um the number of source packages that we the number of source packages that we the number of source packages that we have included in yubuntu in this case. have included in yubuntu in this case. have included in yubuntu in this case. So starting with trusty which is the So starting with trusty which is the So starting with trusty which is the oldest one that we still maintain we had oldest one that we still maintain we had oldest one that we still maintain we had 22,000 source packages and we are in the 22,000 source packages and we are in the 22,000 source packages and we are in the most recent LTS release up to 37,000. So most recent LTS release up to 37,000. So most recent LTS release up to 37,000. So in the course of these 10 years we have in the course of these 10 years we have in the course of these 10 years we have grown by 15,000 source packages which is grown by 15,000 source packages which is grown by 15,000 source packages which is a far significant rate. This is of a far significant rate. This is of a far significant rate. This is of course only represents a small selection course only represents a small selection course only represents a small selection of the number of packages existing in of the number of packages existing in of the number of packages existing in the ecosystem but pulling them bundling the ecosystem but pulling them bundling the ecosystem but pulling them bundling bundling them and distributing them is a bundling them and distributing them is a bundling them and distributing them is a significant effort that has been significant effort that has been significant effort that has been undertaken and continues to grow. So I undertaken and continues to grow. So I undertaken and continues to grow. So I believe plucky which is 254 which is our believe plucky which is 254 which is our believe plucky which is 254 which is our next release is already at 39,000 source next release is already at 39,000 source next release is already at 39,000 source packages and counting. And so again all packages and counting. And so again all packages and counting. And so again all of these numbers you're going to see a of these numbers you're going to see a of these numbers you're going to see a pattern. All the numbers in this pattern. All the numbers in this pattern. All the numbers in this presentation always go in the upward presentation always go in the upward presentation always go in the upward direction except for one which is a very direction except for one which is a very direction except for one which is a very important one. So again population world important one. So again population world important one. So again population world population again number keeps going population again number keeps going population again number keeps going up. GitHub users as well keeps going up up. GitHub users as well keeps going up up. GitHub users as well keeps going up and up and up. So this is from the a and up and up. So this is from the a and up and up. So this is from the a GitHub GitHub blog recently where they GitHub GitHub blog recently where they GitHub GitHub blog recently where they marked that they had reached a 100 marked that they had reached a 100 marked that they had reached a 100 million users and they had reached 100 million users and they had reached 100 million users and they had reached 100 million users I believe two years million users I believe two years million users I believe two years earlier than what they expected. This earlier than what they expected. This earlier than what they expected. This again shows that there are more people again shows that there are more people again shows that there are more people pouring into the Yoko open source pouring into the Yoko open source pouring into the Yoko open source ecosystem like you create your GitHub ecosystem like you create your GitHub ecosystem like you create your GitHub account you create your package all of account you create your package all of account you create your package all of this refeeds into the numbers that we this refeeds into the numbers that we this refeeds into the numbers that we have seen where the ecosystem keeps have seen where the ecosystem keeps have seen where the ecosystem keeps growing and growing. Still, I did say growing and growing. Still, I did say growing and growing. Still, I did say that there was one number that wasn't that there was one number that wasn't that there was one number that wasn't possibly as growing as fast as we possibly as growing as fast as we possibly as growing as fast as we wanted, right? And that number is wanted, right? And that number is wanted, right? And that number is maintainers. Maintainers of packages are maintainers. Maintainers of packages are maintainers. Maintainers of packages are like Daka. And you always need more like Daka. And you always need more like Daka. And you always need more DACA. You always need more maintainers DACA. You always need more maintainers DACA. You always need more maintainers for packages. Like packages end up being for packages. Like packages end up being for packages. Like packages end up being created but then abandoned at a pretty created but then abandoned at a pretty created but then abandoned at a pretty much almost the same rate. A long-term much almost the same rate. A long-term much almost the same rate. A long-term maintainer, somebody that is maintaining maintainer, somebody that is maintaining maintainer, somebody that is maintaining an open source package for a an extended an open source package for a an extended an open source package for a an extended period of year is something that is period of year is something that is period of year is something that is rarer. Creators plenty maintainers for rarer. Creators plenty maintainers for rarer. Creators plenty maintainers for long term, it's a different quite a long term, it's a different quite a long term, it's a different quite a different scenario. But the lack of different scenario. But the lack of different scenario. But the lack of maintainers is not a new issue. like maintainers is not a new issue. like maintainers is not a new issue. like since the be since the dawn of open since the be since the dawn of open since the be since the dawn of open source it has always been a case where source it has always been a case where source it has always been a case where um there's a there's a number of um there's a there's a number of um there's a there's a number of individuals for example that maintain a individuals for example that maintain a individuals for example that maintain a very large number of packages and allow very large number of packages and allow very large number of packages and allow them to continue existing and continue them to continue existing and continue them to continue existing and continue being updated. We don't have like for being updated. We don't have like for being updated. We don't have like for example the possibility of having one example the possibility of having one example the possibility of having one maintainer per package. You do need to maintainer per package. You do need to maintainer per package. You do need to have concentrations where one maintainer have concentrations where one maintainer have concentrations where one maintainer or small group of maintainers have to or small group of maintainers have to or small group of maintainers have to maintain a lot of them. The lack of maintain a lot of them. The lack of maintain a lot of them. The lack of maintainers is not a new issue. There's maintainers is not a new issue. There's maintainers is not a new issue. There's economic pressure, lack of incentive, economic pressure, lack of incentive, economic pressure, lack of incentive, support structure, and sometimes just support structure, and sometimes just support structure, and sometimes just regular life. I believe that the talk regular life. I believe that the talk regular life. I believe that the talk that took place in this room just before that took place in this room just before that took place in this room just before this was trying to emlate some of those this was trying to emlate some of those this was trying to emlate some of those conditions. So the Alpha Omega Fund conditions. So the Alpha Omega Fund conditions. So the Alpha Omega Fund trying to support economically trying to support economically trying to support economically maintainers and incentivize them to maintainers and incentivize them to maintainers and incentivize them to continue on their work. And another continue on their work. And another continue on their work. And another factor that we see is that package factor that we see is that package factor that we see is that package growth in itself leads to package decay. growth in itself leads to package decay. growth in itself leads to package decay. So it's a case where we keep pouring on So it's a case where we keep pouring on So it's a case where we keep pouring on more things into the ecosystem. You uh more things into the ecosystem. You uh more things into the ecosystem. You uh you all know the well-known XKCD comic you all know the well-known XKCD comic you all know the well-known XKCD comic standards like there are 14 standards. standards like there are 14 standards. standards like there are 14 standards. We're going to add one more. There are We're going to add one more. There are We're going to add one more. There are 15 packages that can parse a very 15 packages that can parse a very 15 packages that can parse a very peculiar format of JSON and we should peculiar format of JSON and we should peculiar format of JSON and we should add one more. But this package growth add one more. But this package growth add one more. But this package growth which we see also leads to package which we see also leads to package which we see also leads to package decay. What happens to the oldest one of decay. What happens to the oldest one of decay. What happens to the oldest one of those JSON packages when the 16th one those JSON packages when the 16th one those JSON packages when the 16th one comes around? Is there anybody still comes around? Is there anybody still comes around? Is there anybody still with the interest or the animous to keep with the interest or the animous to keep with the interest or the animous to keep maintaining it over time? So what ends maintaining it over time? So what ends maintaining it over time? So what ends up happening is that packages fall out up happening is that packages fall out up happening is that packages fall out of their favor. They are forked. They of their favor. They are forked. They of their favor. They are forked. They are wholly replaced. They are abandoned are wholly replaced. They are abandoned are wholly replaced. They are abandoned or simply implemented the new. How many or simply implemented the new. How many or simply implemented the new. How many times have you looked at a repo and you times have you looked at a repo and you times have you looked at a repo and you see oh this seems very familiar and it's see oh this seems very familiar and it's see oh this seems very familiar and it's basically a reimplementation in a new basically a reimplementation in a new basically a reimplementation in a new language of something that you have language of something that you have language of something that you have already seen and already existed. already seen and already existed. already seen and already existed. Main maintaining things in open source Main maintaining things in open source Main maintaining things in open source packages requires a very particular mix packages requires a very particular mix packages requires a very particular mix of dedication, knowledge, availability of dedication, knowledge, availability of dedication, knowledge, availability and selflessness which put us in in the and selflessness which put us in in the and selflessness which put us in in the perilous positions where for example we perilous positions where for example we perilous positions where for example we have packages that are very wellnown have packages that are very wellnown have packages that are very wellnown like ours is a silent example. It had a like ours is a silent example. It had a like ours is a silent example. It had a very visible uh RC this January I very visible uh RC this January I very visible uh RC this January I believe. You can read our blog about it. believe. You can read our blog about it. believe. You can read our blog about it. Uh and it's used widely and it has a Uh and it's used widely and it has a Uh and it's used widely and it has a single maintainer which is Andrew. single maintainer which is Andrew. single maintainer which is Andrew. Right? As you can imagine this is not an Right? As you can imagine this is not an Right? As you can imagine this is not an ideal situation. This would be what we ideal situation. This would be what we ideal situation. This would be what we would describe as an undermaintained would describe as an undermaintained would describe as an undermaintained package. There's a single person there package. There's a single person there package. There's a single person there holding up the the forts and making sure holding up the the forts and making sure holding up the the forts and making sure that fixes and all the things go where that fixes and all the things go where that fixes and all the things go where they need to be. Okay. So now that we they need to be. Okay. So now that we they need to be. Okay. So now that we talked a bit about packages, let's draw talked a bit about packages, let's draw talked a bit about packages, let's draw a bit of parallels. Like same thing. a bit of parallels. Like same thing. a bit of parallels. Like same thing. There are only two kinds of languages. There are only two kinds of languages. There are only two kinds of languages. The ones that people complain about and The ones that people complain about and The ones that people complain about and the ones nobody uses. And while I was the ones nobody uses. And while I was the ones nobody uses. And while I was doing this presentation, I was trying doing this presentation, I was trying doing this presentation, I was trying pars. There are only two kinds of pars. There are only two kinds of pars. There are only two kinds of packages. The ones that people complain packages. The ones that people complain packages. The ones that people complain about. And oh, there's a new alert for about. And oh, there's a new alert for about. And oh, there's a new alert for xzutils. Those of you familiar with open xzutils. Those of you familiar with open xzutils. Those of you familiar with open source security know what this is. Uh it source security know what this is. Uh it source security know what this is. Uh it turned out to be rather benign CV, but turned out to be rather benign CV, but turned out to be rather benign CV, but when these things start buzzing, it's when these things start buzzing, it's when these things start buzzing, it's something to to pay attention to. But something to to pay attention to. But something to to pay attention to. But what are indeed the problems that show what are indeed the problems that show what are indeed the problems that show up in the packages that are used? You up in the packages that are used? You up in the packages that are used? You know this that that's why we're at know this that that's why we're at know this that that's why we're at Voncon, right? CVEes like fleas on a Voncon, right? CVEes like fleas on a Voncon, right? CVEes like fleas on a dog. The numbers of the number of dog. The numbers of the number of dog. The numbers of the number of CVs. The number of CVEes keeps growing CVs. The number of CVEes keeps growing CVs. The number of CVEes keeps growing year-over-year. This data is from CV.org year-over-year. This data is from CV.org year-over-year. This data is from CV.org in the metrics page. I've seen some in the metrics page. I've seen some in the metrics page. I've seen some different numbers being thrown around. different numbers being thrown around. different numbers being thrown around. Voncon, please do not harm me. It's just Voncon, please do not harm me. It's just Voncon, please do not harm me. It's just uh ways in which we measure things but uh ways in which we measure things but uh ways in which we measure things but it's it's very clear if you look at that it's it's very clear if you look at that it's it's very clear if you look at that there's a huge jump from 2023 to 2024 uh there's a huge jump from 2023 to 2024 uh there's a huge jump from 2023 to 2024 uh where things simply grow and these these where things simply grow and these these where things simply grow and these these things seem to be comparable right we're things seem to be comparable right we're things seem to be comparable right we're growing in number of packages we're growing in number of packages we're growing in number of packages we're growing in number of CVS but are they growing in number of CVS but are they growing in number of CVS but are they really parallel lines going in the same really parallel lines going in the same really parallel lines going in the same direction let's not make any mistakes direction let's not make any mistakes direction let's not make any mistakes here having more CV ids assigned is a here having more CV ids assigned is a here having more CV ids assigned is a good thing despite the fact there are good thing despite the fact there are good thing despite the fact there are still some issues to iron out. For those still some issues to iron out. For those still some issues to iron out. For those of you that don't know what DVWA, that's of you that don't know what DVWA, that's of you that don't know what DVWA, that's damn vulnerable web app and that's a CVE damn vulnerable web app and that's a CVE damn vulnerable web app and that's a CVE that somebody got assigned to it. It's a that somebody got assigned to it. It's a that somebody got assigned to it. It's a training application that is well training application that is well training application that is well vulnerable. The clue is in the name. You vulnerable. The clue is in the name. You vulnerable. The clue is in the name. You should not uh be able to get a CV should not uh be able to get a CV should not uh be able to get a CV assigned to it. I believe that this one assigned to it. I believe that this one assigned to it. I believe that this one was withdrawn but everybody laughed hard was withdrawn but everybody laughed hard was withdrawn but everybody laughed hard heartily when they saw what do you mean heartily when they saw what do you mean heartily when they saw what do you mean DVWA as a as a CV? what that thing is DVWA as a as a CV? what that thing is DVWA as a as a CV? what that thing is like is a seieve by on purpose. Um so like is a seieve by on purpose. Um so like is a seieve by on purpose. Um so assignments as a whole are growing fast assignments as a whole are growing fast assignments as a whole are growing fast and there's obvious uh that certain CNAs and there's obvious uh that certain CNAs and there's obvious uh that certain CNAs lead the pack. So we have patch tag lead the pack. So we have patch tag lead the pack. So we have patch tag kernel.org and word fence are the top kernel.org and word fence are the top kernel.org and word fence are the top three C uh CNAs that are like just three C uh CNAs that are like just three C uh CNAs that are like just pumping things out. Um but let's look a pumping things out. Um but let's look a pumping things out. Um but let's look a bit closer. So package growth does seem bit closer. So package growth does seem bit closer. So package growth does seem to line up with CV growth. So, we get to line up with CV growth. So, we get to line up with CV growth. So, we get more packages, we get more CV for those more packages, we get more CV for those more packages, we get more CV for those packages, and everything should be okay, packages, and everything should be okay, packages, and everything should be okay, right? We're we're keeping pace. But are right? We're we're keeping pace. But are right? We're we're keeping pace. But are we What about the ocean that sits behind we What about the ocean that sits behind we What about the ocean that sits behind that wave? What about all the things that wave? What about all the things that wave? What about all the things that are left behind? What about the that are left behind? What about the that are left behind? What about the first package that implemented that JSON first package that implemented that JSON first package that implemented that JSON format rather than the 16th package that format rather than the 16th package that format rather than the 16th package that implemented that JSON format? Are we implemented that JSON format? Are we implemented that JSON format? Are we keeping pace with that? keeping pace with that? keeping pace with that? Let's talk about abandonment issues and Let's talk about abandonment issues and Let's talk about abandonment issues and undermaintained and unmaintained undermaintained and unmaintained undermaintained and unmaintained packages. I picked this graph for one packages. I picked this graph for one packages. I picked this graph for one very particular reason. Please show of very particular reason. Please show of very particular reason. Please show of hands. Who has used source forge in the hands. Who has used source forge in the hands. Who has used source forge in the past past past year? I guess that makes part of my year? I guess that makes part of my year? I guess that makes part of my point. Um this this graph here was about point. Um this this graph here was about point. Um this this graph here was about a study about clusters of what a study about clusters of what a study about clusters of what constitutes active, inactive and dormant constitutes active, inactive and dormant constitutes active, inactive and dormant projects in source forge using different projects in source forge using different projects in source forge using different thresholds. And this was from 2012, so thresholds. And this was from 2012, so thresholds. And this was from 2012, so about 13 years ago. And already at the about 13 years ago. And already at the about 13 years ago. And already at the point it was quite obvious that we had a point it was quite obvious that we had a point it was quite obvious that we had a lot of projects that were already laying lot of projects that were already laying lot of projects that were already laying dormant. This is a tendency that was not dormant. This is a tendency that was not dormant. This is a tendency that was not as far as I understand it improved. as far as I understand it improved. as far as I understand it improved. Search for as a whole is now dormant. If Search for as a whole is now dormant. If Search for as a whole is now dormant. If you imagine, can you think about how you imagine, can you think about how you imagine, can you think about how many packages you've used in 20 2012 many packages you've used in 20 2012 many packages you've used in 20 2012 2010 that are probably still in use in 2010 that are probably still in use in 2010 that are probably still in use in some very old production system that you some very old production system that you some very old production system that you created where the source force repo is created where the source force repo is created where the source force repo is like like like completely well just exists there. completely well just exists there. completely well just exists there. There's no interaction in the past 13 There's no interaction in the past 13 There's no interaction in the past 13 years. Dormant packages suffer from years. Dormant packages suffer from years. Dormant packages suffer from consistent abandonment over time and consistent abandonment over time and consistent abandonment over time and that's not a new phenomena. As I said, that's not a new phenomena. As I said, that's not a new phenomena. As I said, GitHub hit a 100 million users, but a GitHub hit a 100 million users, but a GitHub hit a 100 million users, but a lot of those users like do one commit or lot of those users like do one commit or lot of those users like do one commit or they are following a trend that says, they are following a trend that says, they are following a trend that says, "Oh, contribute to open source so that "Oh, contribute to open source so that "Oh, contribute to open source so that you can get a job." They do one or two you can get a job." They do one or two you can get a job." They do one or two things and then they walk away and things and then they walk away and things and then they walk away and whatever code exists there has like a whatever code exists there has like a whatever code exists there has like a commit pushed and just nothing commit pushed and just nothing commit pushed and just nothing else. So, let's now role play a bit then else. So, let's now role play a bit then else. So, let's now role play a bit then through one of the scenarios. I use through one of the scenarios. I use through one of the scenarios. I use GitHub here because it's the de facto GitHub here because it's the de facto GitHub here because it's the de facto thing where most packages are living and thing where most packages are living and thing where most packages are living and let's imagine what happens when a a let's imagine what happens when a a let's imagine what happens when a a submission a report a message comes in submission a report a message comes in submission a report a message comes in uh to one of these repos where a package uh to one of these repos where a package uh to one of these repos where a package exists and let's imagine it in the exists and let's imagine it in the exists and let's imagine it in the various scenarios that we are facing. various scenarios that we are facing. various scenarios that we are facing. So, we're looking for example to compare So, we're looking for example to compare So, we're looking for example to compare between a well-maintained package, an between a well-maintained package, an between a well-maintained package, an undermaintained package, and spoiler undermaintained package, and spoiler undermaintained package, and spoiler alerts. Uh, no, sorry, I said an alerts. Uh, no, sorry, I said an alerts. Uh, no, sorry, I said an undermaintained package and spoiler undermaintained package and spoiler undermaintained package and spoiler alert, an unmaintained package. In the alert, an unmaintained package. In the alert, an unmaintained package. In the case of an unmaintained package, this case of an unmaintained package, this case of an unmaintained package, this goes nowhere. You send a message, it goes nowhere. You send a message, it goes nowhere. You send a message, it hits straight to the void, that thing at hits straight to the void, that thing at hits straight to the void, that thing at the top of the box. But we'll visit the the top of the box. But we'll visit the the top of the box. But we'll visit the void in a bit. As you stare into the void in a bit. As you stare into the void in a bit. As you stare into the void, the void also stares back. So, a void, the void also stares back. So, a void, the void also stares back. So, a message drops in. You have found this message drops in. You have found this message drops in. You have found this thing in your package when I was doing thing in your package when I was doing thing in your package when I was doing some testing. I don't know what to make some testing. I don't know what to make some testing. I don't know what to make of it. And this is important. Sometimes of it. And this is important. Sometimes of it. And this is important. Sometimes people that are like sending in an issue people that are like sending in an issue people that are like sending in an issue there, they don't know what it is. Like there, they don't know what it is. Like there, they don't know what it is. Like there are a lot of security research is there are a lot of security research is there are a lot of security research is running a piece of code and going, "Ah, running a piece of code and going, "Ah, running a piece of code and going, "Ah, that's odd." And then checking if that's odd." And then checking if that's odd." And then checking if somebody has reported on it before. So somebody has reported on it before. So somebody has reported on it before. So let's say we get this message here and let's say we get this message here and let's say we get this message here and let's try to look at the the possible let's try to look at the the possible let's try to look at the the possible outcomes of what this thing that is outcomes of what this thing that is outcomes of what this thing that is reported is. So true positive and true reported is. So true positive and true reported is. So true positive and true negative in a sense this is a negative in a sense this is a negative in a sense this is a vulnerability this is not a vulnerability this is not a vulnerability this is not a vulnerability are fairly straightforward vulnerability are fairly straightforward vulnerability are fairly straightforward even for undermaintained packages things even for undermaintained packages things even for undermaintained packages things generally run its course in um a generally run its course in um a generally run its course in um a reasonable amount of time because the reasonable amount of time because the reasonable amount of time because the outcomes are pretty clear like if you outcomes are pretty clear like if you outcomes are pretty clear like if you come up with something and you say oh um come up with something and you say oh um come up with something and you say oh um I if I run this and I pass this payload I if I run this and I pass this payload I if I run this and I pass this payload this this deletes your whole system yeah this this deletes your whole system yeah this this deletes your whole system yeah that's pretty straightforward that that's pretty straightforward that that's pretty straightforward that you're not moving the French language you're not moving the French language you're not moving the French language pack and it's indeed an issue for the pack and it's indeed an issue for the pack and it's indeed an issue for the system processes. The process runs system processes. The process runs system processes. The process runs fully. The key differences here are in fully. The key differences here are in fully. The key differences here are in how complete the process is in a how complete the process is in a how complete the process is in a well-maintained package versus an well-maintained package versus an well-maintained package versus an undermaintained package. Like for undermaintained package. Like for undermaintained package. Like for example, in an undermaintained package, example, in an undermaintained package, example, in an undermaintained package, the person that is handling it might not the person that is handling it might not the person that is handling it might not know how to do a CVE, how to get a CV know how to do a CVE, how to get a CV know how to do a CVE, how to get a CV assigned. GitHub now really helps with assigned. GitHub now really helps with assigned. GitHub now really helps with that. they I believe that a blog came that. they I believe that a blog came that. they I believe that a blog came out just the other day explaining how out just the other day explaining how out just the other day explaining how they make the tools available for people they make the tools available for people they make the tools available for people to do it or use the the GitHub to do it or use the the GitHub to do it or use the the GitHub advisories. Uh the usage of private advisories. Uh the usage of private advisories. Uh the usage of private reporting is also something common. So reporting is also something common. So reporting is also something common. So again, GitHub feature that you can use again, GitHub feature that you can use again, GitHub feature that you can use to send in a report in a discrete manner to send in a report in a discrete manner to send in a report in a discrete manner rather than open a public issue like the rather than open a public issue like the rather than open a public issue like the one that we saw that basically says hey one that we saw that basically says hey one that we saw that basically says hey I found a thing. The fact that the I found a thing. The fact that the I found a thing. The fact that the issues are public are something that is issues are public are something that is issues are public are something that is going to play an important role here. going to play an important role here. going to play an important role here. and the patching methodology which is and the patching methodology which is and the patching methodology which is ideally we should not be patching things ideally we should not be patching things ideally we should not be patching things in the open. We should then just release in the open. We should then just release in the open. We should then just release it when we are ready to release the it when we are ready to release the it when we are ready to release the vulnerability vulnerability vulnerability outside for the negative case. So in the outside for the negative case. So in the outside for the negative case. So in the case where it's not a vulnerability, case where it's not a vulnerability, case where it's not a vulnerability, it's just something that was reported, it's just something that was reported, it's just something that was reported, the time to verdict is generally the key the time to verdict is generally the key the time to verdict is generally the key metric. Like in a well-maintained metric. Like in a well-maintained metric. Like in a well-maintained project with a lot of people looking at project with a lot of people looking at project with a lot of people looking at it that are well trained and know the it that are well trained and know the it that are well trained and know the triage procedure, making the triage procedure, making the triage procedure, making the determination that this is not this is determination that this is not this is determination that this is not this is not a security issue. It's a feature or not a security issue. It's a feature or not a security issue. It's a feature or it's a bug, but it's not a security bug it's a bug, but it's not a security bug it's a bug, but it's not a security bug is rather fast. In an undermine package, is rather fast. In an undermine package, is rather fast. In an undermine package, you might need to be chasing the you might need to be chasing the you might need to be chasing the maintainer for two weeks sending out a maintainer for two weeks sending out a maintainer for two weeks sending out a few emails. Unsurprisingly, um, more few emails. Unsurprisingly, um, more few emails. Unsurprisingly, um, more resources tend to lead to quicker and resources tend to lead to quicker and resources tend to lead to quicker and better outcomes. False positives again better outcomes. False positives again better outcomes. False positives again come in various shape and sizes. They come in various shape and sizes. They come in various shape and sizes. They can be issues just just not security can be issues just just not security can be issues just just not security issues. For example, they might not fit issues. For example, they might not fit issues. For example, they might not fit in what the maintainer considers to be a in what the maintainer considers to be a in what the maintainer considers to be a security issue or something that is security issue or something that is security issue or something that is simply nothing at all. Hello to the curl simply nothing at all. Hello to the curl simply nothing at all. Hello to the curl hallucinations. Those were very fun to hallucinations. Those were very fun to hallucinations. Those were very fun to read. And in the case where um a CV for read. And in the case where um a CV for read. And in the case where um a CV for example is assigned that ends up being a example is assigned that ends up being a example is assigned that ends up being a false positive in an understaffed false positive in an understaffed false positive in an understaffed project there might not be uh the project there might not be uh the project there might not be uh the willingness or the motivation to go and willingness or the motivation to go and willingness or the motivation to go and contest it and you could simply just let contest it and you could simply just let contest it and you could simply just let it roll. The issue with keeping a false it roll. The issue with keeping a false it roll. The issue with keeping a false positive around is this is a salient positive around is this is a salient positive around is this is a salient example that I dealt a lot in my example that I dealt a lot in my example that I dealt a lot in my previous role which is this uh CV for O previous role which is this uh CV for O previous role which is this uh CV for O open SSH where basically they the open SSH where basically they the open SSH where basically they the maintainers do not believe it to be a maintainers do not believe it to be a maintainers do not believe it to be a security issue but it keeps popping up security issue but it keeps popping up security issue but it keeps popping up in vulnerability scanners. Keeping false in vulnerability scanners. Keeping false in vulnerability scanners. Keeping false positives around creates compliance positives around creates compliance positives around creates compliance problems down the line for whatever problems down the line for whatever problems down the line for whatever package they might be. And then this is package they might be. And then this is package they might be. And then this is probably the worst case which is the probably the worst case which is the probably the worst case which is the false negative in a well-maintained false negative in a well-maintained false negative in a well-maintained project. Uh this is hard to read but on project. Uh this is hard to read but on project. Uh this is hard to read but on top is basically there's a false top is basically there's a false top is basically there's a false negative you say this is not a security negative you say this is not a security negative you say this is not a security issue but it's a well-maintained project issue but it's a well-maintained project issue but it's a well-maintained project is the popular one. So people come is the popular one. So people come is the popular one. So people come around and say uh this doesn't sound around and say uh this doesn't sound around and say uh this doesn't sound right please revisit there's clearly right please revisit there's clearly right please revisit there's clearly something here and it generally circles something here and it generally circles something here and it generally circles back to the queue false general back to the queue false general back to the queue false general operating procedures for operating procedures for operating procedures for vulnerabilities. If you get a false vulnerabilities. If you get a false vulnerabilities. If you get a false negative in an undermaintained project, negative in an undermaintained project, negative in an undermaintained project, well, the same sentences may show up, well, the same sentences may show up, well, the same sentences may show up, but there's a possibility that it just but there's a possibility that it just but there's a possibility that it just disappears into the void and nobody disappears into the void and nobody disappears into the void and nobody revisits the ticket again. And you end revisits the ticket again. And you end revisits the ticket again. And you end up with a situation where there's a a up with a situation where there's a a up with a situation where there's a a public issue on GitHub that fully public issue on GitHub that fully public issue on GitHub that fully describes an describes an describes an attack that didn't get a CV assigned attack that didn't get a CV assigned attack that didn't get a CV assigned that got considered as security and all that got considered as security and all that got considered as security and all the information is there for whatever the information is there for whatever the information is there for whatever person with whatever intentions might person with whatever intentions might person with whatever intentions might decide to use. Right? This is the worst decide to use. Right? This is the worst decide to use. Right? This is the worst outcome. What is it? Let's look back at outcome. What is it? Let's look back at outcome. What is it? Let's look back at the box. Remember the void? What's in the box. Remember the void? What's in the box. Remember the void? What's in the box? What ends up being inside that the box? What ends up being inside that the box? What ends up being inside that four square box where we fit it to the four square box where we fit it to the four square box where we fit it to the top slot? Well, dragons. Uh, this is a top slot? Well, dragons. Uh, this is a top slot? Well, dragons. Uh, this is a message from OSS security just a few message from OSS security just a few message from OSS security just a few days ago where basically there's a days ago where basically there's a days ago where basically there's a library lib SPF2 that appears to be the library lib SPF2 that appears to be the library lib SPF2 that appears to be the standard way of parsing SPF records in standard way of parsing SPF records in standard way of parsing SPF records in C, email thingies. uh who wonder who C, email thingies. uh who wonder who C, email thingies. uh who wonder who need has need of that but development is need has need of that but development is need has need of that but development is mostly stalled. The package has for all mostly stalled. The package has for all mostly stalled. The package has for all intents and purposes been abandoned. In intents and purposes been abandoned. In intents and purposes been abandoned. In the project's GitHub repo, there's an the project's GitHub repo, there's an the project's GitHub repo, there's an unmmerged pull request claiming to fix a unmmerged pull request claiming to fix a unmmerged pull request claiming to fix a use after free use after free use after free bug. So this puts us in a position where bug. So this puts us in a position where bug. So this puts us in a position where use after free is something that use after free is something that use after free is something that you well ill-intentioned attacker could you well ill-intentioned attacker could you well ill-intentioned attacker could pick this up and go do something with pick this up and go do something with pick this up and go do something with it. But we are in a point where what's it. But we are in a point where what's it. But we are in a point where what's going to happen to here? I didn't I going to happen to here? I didn't I going to happen to here? I didn't I didn't have the foresight to link to the didn't have the foresight to link to the didn't have the foresight to link to the poll request, but it's something that poll request, but it's something that poll request, but it's something that was submitted in was submitted in was submitted in 2016. So, it's already almost 10 years 2016. So, it's already almost 10 years 2016. So, it's already almost 10 years old and somebody just now noticed it. I old and somebody just now noticed it. I old and somebody just now noticed it. I wonder how long it has been there at wonder how long it has been there at wonder how long it has been there at least 2016 or previous discovery and least 2016 or previous discovery and least 2016 or previous discovery and what has might have been done with it. what has might have been done with it. what has might have been done with it. Okay, here's an even refresher example Okay, here's an even refresher example Okay, here's an even refresher example that I picked up when I was doing this that I picked up when I was doing this that I picked up when I was doing this preparing for this. I was already at preparing for this. I was already at preparing for this. I was already at voncon like this is um a thing in the voncon like this is um a thing in the voncon like this is um a thing in the function to to uh its giflib and it in function to to uh its giflib and it in function to to uh its giflib and it in essence was oh this is an issue that is essence was oh this is an issue that is essence was oh this is an issue that is being reported now it's a 2025 assigned being reported now it's a 2025 assigned being reported now it's a 2025 assigned CVE that was apparently reported in 2016 CVE that was apparently reported in 2016 CVE that was apparently reported in 2016 and apparently it said oh yeah this and apparently it said oh yeah this and apparently it said oh yeah this thing is all fixed but it wasn't right thing is all fixed but it wasn't right thing is all fixed but it wasn't right there's a lot of things lurking and of there's a lot of things lurking and of there's a lot of things lurking and of course for bonus points this is source course for bonus points this is source course for bonus points this is source forge for those that have never seen forge for those that have never seen forge for those that have never seen that wonderful interface. These things that wonderful interface. These things that wonderful interface. These things exist and are out there, right? And then exist and are out there, right? And then exist and are out there, right? And then we get the usual, oh, I'm sure it's we get the usual, oh, I'm sure it's we get the usual, oh, I'm sure it's fine. These packages are international fine. These packages are international fine. These packages are international data, which is in part true, but that's data, which is in part true, but that's data, which is in part true, but that's the beauty of compiling from source. the beauty of compiling from source. the beauty of compiling from source. They don't have to be. You can go there, They don't have to be. You can go there, They don't have to be. You can go there, you can pull the source, you can compile you can pull the source, you can compile you can pull the source, you can compile it yourself, and you can use it. That's it yourself, and you can use it. That's it yourself, and you can use it. That's the beauty of open source. Oh, but the beauty of open source. Oh, but the beauty of open source. Oh, but nobody is using these packages. Well, I nobody is using these packages. Well, I nobody is using these packages. Well, I digress. I disagree. lib SPF2 is the digress. I disagree. lib SPF2 is the digress. I disagree. lib SPF2 is the first result when you search C library first result when you search C library first result when you search C library to process SPF records. I don't know why to process SPF records. I don't know why to process SPF records. I don't know why somebody's running a web server on C, somebody's running a web server on C, somebody's running a web server on C, but power to them. People know better but power to them. People know better but power to them. People know better than to use abandoned than to use abandoned than to use abandoned packages. Uh but sometimes no packages. Uh but sometimes no packages. Uh but sometimes no alternatives exist. Like for example, I alternatives exist. Like for example, I alternatives exist. Like for example, I cannot name any other C package that cannot name any other C package that cannot name any other C package that does the same same thing. So uh we does the same same thing. So uh we does the same same thing. So uh we should assign a CV for it then. Well, we should assign a CV for it then. Well, we should assign a CV for it then. Well, we don't even know if this is really an don't even know if this is really an don't even know if this is really an issue. The PR is from 10 years ago. The issue. The PR is from 10 years ago. The issue. The PR is from 10 years ago. The maintainer is gone. What do we do here? maintainer is gone. What do we do here? maintainer is gone. What do we do here? Okay, we should assign a CV anyway. Okay, we should assign a CV anyway. Okay, we should assign a CV anyway. Okay, but what is the path forward to Okay, but what is the path forward to Okay, but what is the path forward to ensure that we assign a CV, this starts ensure that we assign a CV, this starts ensure that we assign a CV, this starts showing up on scanners, but then what? showing up on scanners, but then what? showing up on scanners, but then what? How how do we address this? Like we have How how do we address this? Like we have How how do we address this? Like we have no path forward here. Okay, so this is no path forward here. Okay, so this is no path forward here. Okay, so this is to show that you can hop now on GitHub to show that you can hop now on GitHub to show that you can hop now on GitHub and you could you're search queries away and you could you're search queries away and you could you're search queries away from finding orphan issues and orphan from finding orphan issues and orphan from finding orphan issues and orphan projects that just might be security projects that just might be security projects that just might be security related. Now with these new fangled related. Now with these new fangled related. Now with these new fangled lamps, maybe you can whip up a crawler lamps, maybe you can whip up a crawler lamps, maybe you can whip up a crawler that reads through those PRs and flags that reads through those PRs and flags that reads through those PRs and flags what might be juicy things. Who knows what might be juicy things. Who knows what might be juicy things. Who knows what zero days or 10year days, wait, what zero days or 10year days, wait, what zero days or 10year days, wait, does that count? Uh maybe buried in does that count? Uh maybe buried in does that count? Uh maybe buried in those very old messages. So and beyond those very old messages. So and beyond those very old messages. So and beyond repos, you have emails to domains at repos, you have emails to domains at repos, you have emails to domains at laps, messages to forums and IoT laps, messages to forums and IoT laps, messages to forums and IoT channels that have gone unanswered. Just channels that have gone unanswered. Just channels that have gone unanswered. Just a lot of things lost into the dev null a lot of things lost into the dev null a lot of things lost into the dev null analoges, right? In essence, when we are analoges, right? In essence, when we are analoges, right? In essence, when we are looking at abandoned packages and looking at abandoned packages and looking at abandoned packages and vulnerabilities in them, it's what vulnerabilities in them, it's what vulnerabilities in them, it's what happens to the hole when the cheese is happens to the hole when the cheese is happens to the hole when the cheese is gone. I'll get let you understand what gone. I'll get let you understand what gone. I'll get let you understand what the the cheese is obviously the package the the cheese is obviously the package the the cheese is obviously the package here, right? So, what what happens to here, right? So, what what happens to here, right? So, what what happens to these vulnerabilities? Are they these vulnerabilities? Are they these vulnerabilities? Are they vulnerabilities? Yes, I believe so. But vulnerabilities? Yes, I believe so. But vulnerabilities? Yes, I believe so. But what can we do about them? Right? what can we do about them? Right? what can we do about them? Right? Indeed, it's what it says. Like, how Indeed, it's what it says. Like, how Indeed, it's what it says. Like, how many things might be out there in the many things might be out there in the many things might be out there in the ecosystem and abandoned packages that ecosystem and abandoned packages that ecosystem and abandoned packages that need redressing? So all right let's go need redressing? So all right let's go need redressing? So all right let's go uh what we can do about this but before uh what we can do about this but before uh what we can do about this but before a small detour for those of you not in a small detour for those of you not in a small detour for those of you not in the know this is Hungarian mathematician the know this is Hungarian mathematician the know this is Hungarian mathematician called Paul Erdish of the Erdish number called Paul Erdish of the Erdish number called Paul Erdish of the Erdish number you perhaps have heard of it and Erdish you perhaps have heard of it and Erdish you perhaps have heard of it and Erdish has a thing that I really love it's a has a thing that I really love it's a has a thing that I really love it's a mathematical result I love which is mathematical result I love which is mathematical result I love which is called the friendship theorem I'm not called the friendship theorem I'm not called the friendship theorem I'm not going to read this this is the Wikipedia going to read this this is the Wikipedia going to read this this is the Wikipedia definition I ask um ask AI to help me definition I ask um ask AI to help me definition I ask um ask AI to help me this like this is a very dull thing this like this is a very dull thing this like this is a very dull thing should you help me make the theorem a should you help me make the theorem a should you help me make the theorem a bit bit bit nicer and this is what it shows up no my nicer and this is what it shows up no my nicer and this is what it shows up no my sides are not so ugly. But in essence, sides are not so ugly. But in essence, sides are not so ugly. But in essence, the friendship theorem states that if the friendship theorem states that if the friendship theorem states that if every pair of people in the room, like every pair of people in the room, like every pair of people in the room, like for example, us have exactly one friend for example, us have exactly one friend for example, us have exactly one friend in common, then there is someone who is in common, then there is someone who is in common, then there is someone who is friends with everyone, right? Uh and why friends with everyone, right? Uh and why friends with everyone, right? Uh and why do I want to point to the friendship do I want to point to the friendship do I want to point to the friendship theorem to draw a parallel here? In theorem to draw a parallel here? In theorem to draw a parallel here? In essence, um, this is the one of the essence, um, this is the one of the essence, um, this is the one of the things that I want to talk about my things that I want to talk about my things that I want to talk about my talk, which is all right, we don't have talk, which is all right, we don't have talk, which is all right, we don't have exactly one friend in common between exactly one friend in common between exactly one friend in common between each of us, but we do have like uh each of us, but we do have like uh each of us, but we do have like uh something that we all know and know to something that we all know and know to something that we all know and know to be common between us that we can point be common between us that we can point be common between us that we can point to which is in essence open source to which is in essence open source to which is in essence open source districts for example like the one in districts for example like the one in districts for example like the one in our work at right. So the proposal here our work at right. So the proposal here our work at right. So the proposal here for the vulnerability responder of last for the vulnerability responder of last for the vulnerability responder of last resort is that armed with this aggre resort is that armed with this aggre resort is that armed with this aggre aggregate knowledge of the ecosystem aggregate knowledge of the ecosystem aggregate knowledge of the ecosystem distros which are well known by everyone distros which are well known by everyone distros which are well known by everyone that is pretty much participating in the that is pretty much participating in the that is pretty much participating in the system like the devices that they are system like the devices that they are system like the devices that they are running when they are finding these running when they are finding these running when they are finding these vulnerabilities and reporting and are vulnerabilities and reporting and are vulnerabilities and reporting and are running adro of some sort can be well running adro of some sort can be well running adro of some sort can be well positioned to connect reporters to positioned to connect reporters to positioned to connect reporters to maintainers. Help reporters structure maintainers. Help reporters structure maintainers. Help reporters structure their communication to ensure that they their communication to ensure that they their communication to ensure that they are actionable. help maintainers as well are actionable. help maintainers as well are actionable. help maintainers as well with triaging issues and patches and with triaging issues and patches and with triaging issues and patches and assisting with disclosure coordination assisting with disclosure coordination assisting with disclosure coordination process. This applies for example for process. This applies for example for process. This applies for example for the undermaintained side of things. It's the undermaintained side of things. It's the undermaintained side of things. It's what I said at the start like for what I said at the start like for what I said at the start like for example if you're a maintainer that has example if you're a maintainer that has example if you're a maintainer that has no clue of how to assign a CVE and you no clue of how to assign a CVE and you no clue of how to assign a CVE and you would like somebody to handhold you would like somebody to handhold you would like somebody to handhold you through the process and if it's a through the process and if it's a through the process and if it's a package that is somewhat carried by package that is somewhat carried by package that is somewhat carried by additional hey perhaps additional can additional hey perhaps additional can additional hey perhaps additional can like lend a hand. It's in its own like lend a hand. It's in its own like lend a hand. It's in its own there's obviously an element of there's obviously an element of there's obviously an element of self-interest here. I'm not going to say self-interest here. I'm not going to say self-interest here. I'm not going to say that this is fully selfless, but there that this is fully selfless, but there that this is fully selfless, but there has to be something here that this put has to be something here that this put has to be something here that this put themselves in a position to get access themselves in a position to get access themselves in a position to get access to potential issues to stay at the to potential issues to stay at the to potential issues to stay at the forefront of security which I believe forefront of security which I believe forefront of security which I believe benefits ends up benefiting benefits ends up benefiting benefits ends up benefiting all. So the idea here the the models all. So the idea here the the models all. So the idea here the the models proposal so this is like the inception proposal so this is like the inception proposal so this is like the inception the seed for a thing that I have hope to the seed for a thing that I have hope to the seed for a thing that I have hope to keep developing over the course of this keep developing over the course of this keep developing over the course of this year and more is to be like a beacon year and more is to be like a beacon year and more is to be like a beacon like a candle in the dark. So gather like a candle in the dark. So gather like a candle in the dark. So gather first it's to gather bit gather a bit of first it's to gather bit gather a bit of first it's to gather bit gather a bit of our data know how much might be lurking our data know how much might be lurking our data know how much might be lurking below the surface. So for example these below the surface. So for example these below the surface. So for example these PRs to well abandoned repos on packages PRs to well abandoned repos on packages PRs to well abandoned repos on packages that are distributed and in use how many that are distributed and in use how many that are distributed and in use how many of those are out there I don't think of those are out there I don't think of those are out there I don't think didn't really look too hard but I don't didn't really look too hard but I don't didn't really look too hard but I don't think we have really strong numbers on think we have really strong numbers on think we have really strong numbers on what might be out there. That's the what might be out there. That's the what might be out there. That's the whole point of like these unknown whole point of like these unknown whole point of like these unknown vulnerabilities. We could also assist vulnerabilities. We could also assist vulnerabilities. We could also assist reporters in getting where they need to reporters in getting where they need to reporters in getting where they need to be. For example, if you are a reporter be. For example, if you are a reporter be. For example, if you are a reporter and you're trying to report something to and you're trying to report something to and you're trying to report something to a package that is dead and gone, hey, a package that is dead and gone, hey, a package that is dead and gone, hey, perhaps we know someone that knows perhaps we know someone that knows perhaps we know someone that knows someone that owns one of the forks of it someone that owns one of the forks of it someone that owns one of the forks of it and maybe the code is the same or maybe and maybe the code is the same or maybe and maybe the code is the same or maybe we know someone that implemented a we know someone that implemented a we know someone that implemented a different version of it and we can different version of it and we can different version of it and we can redirect that report and we can check redirect that report and we can check redirect that report and we can check other things. It does not have to be, other things. It does not have to be, other things. It does not have to be, oh, I tried to report this thing, the oh, I tried to report this thing, the oh, I tried to report this thing, the package is gone, it goes straight to dev package is gone, it goes straight to dev package is gone, it goes straight to dev null and we never think about it again. null and we never think about it again. null and we never think about it again. On the other side for undermaintained On the other side for undermaintained On the other side for undermaintained packages so packages with poor resources packages so packages with poor resources packages so packages with poor resources we can also assist maintainers with we can also assist maintainers with we can also assist maintainers with coordinating disclosures. If this is in coordinating disclosures. If this is in coordinating disclosures. If this is in the interest of everybody involved we the interest of everybody involved we the interest of everybody involved we can help out with this like in the case can help out with this like in the case can help out with this like in the case I said for our sync there was a great I said for our sync there was a great I said for our sync there was a great deal of collaboration considering this deal of collaboration considering this deal of collaboration considering this only has a single maintainer for the only has a single maintainer for the only has a single maintainer for the findings that uh I believe it was qualis findings that uh I believe it was qualis findings that uh I believe it was qualis actually kudos to qualis if they were actually kudos to qualis if they were actually kudos to qualis if they were here uh brought up. Another thing is here uh brought up. Another thing is here uh brought up. Another thing is together with this thing for hard data together with this thing for hard data together with this thing for hard data is to identify packages that have fallen is to identify packages that have fallen is to identify packages that have fallen off the grid. The difficulty in this is off the grid. The difficulty in this is off the grid. The difficulty in this is basically setting the criteria uh basically setting the criteria uh basically setting the criteria uh because oh we look at activity on issues because oh we look at activity on issues because oh we look at activity on issues or things or features that are proposed or things or features that are proposed or things or features that are proposed but you can look for example at packages but you can look for example at packages but you can look for example at packages that are very crystallized and those that are very crystallized and those that are very crystallized and those packages don't have any activity but packages don't have any activity but packages don't have any activity but that's on purpose because there's that's on purpose because there's that's on purpose because there's nothing to do there. There are no new nothing to do there. There are no new nothing to do there. There are no new reports there are no new features to reports there are no new features to reports there are no new features to implement. So there is no easy simple implement. So there is no easy simple implement. So there is no easy simple metric to by which you can determine metric to by which you can determine metric to by which you can determine that this package is gone. There's also that this package is gone. There's also that this package is gone. There's also the thing about the moment where you the thing about the moment where you the thing about the moment where you check because oh if you're checking no check because oh if you're checking no check because oh if you're checking no activity in the past three years and you activity in the past three years and you activity in the past three years and you check and you only check two months from check and you only check two months from check and you only check two months from there or three months from there maybe there or three months from there maybe there or three months from there maybe it has gone abandoned in the t plus one it has gone abandoned in the t plus one it has gone abandoned in the t plus one second and what happens in that 3 months second and what happens in that 3 months second and what happens in that 3 months window right the other is again have window right the other is again have window right the other is again have alternatives ready when crystallized alternatives ready when crystallized alternatives ready when crystallized packages get shattered like that SPF packages get shattered like that SPF packages get shattered like that SPF package there it was pretty much the package there it was pretty much the package there it was pretty much the only option that exists for doing that only option that exists for doing that only option that exists for doing that thing for C do we have any options if thing for C do we have any options if thing for C do we have any options if that thing comes out with a a that thing comes out with a a that thing comes out with a a vulnerability that simply cannot be vulnerability that simply cannot be vulnerability that simply cannot be fixed because it's part and parcel of fixed because it's part and parcel of fixed because it's part and parcel of the design or it has a cryptographic the design or it has a cryptographic the design or it has a cryptographic flow of some sort that is non-fixable, flow of some sort that is non-fixable, flow of some sort that is non-fixable, right? And most of all to do all of the right? And most of all to do all of the right? And most of all to do all of the above earnestly and for the collective above earnestly and for the collective above earnestly and for the collective good of the open source ecosystem. So in good of the open source ecosystem. So in good of the open source ecosystem. So in sense the beacons are lit, we will we sense the beacons are lit, we will we sense the beacons are lit, we will we will render aid. So thank you all for will render aid. So thank you all for will render aid. So thank you all for your time and I'm open for questions.
