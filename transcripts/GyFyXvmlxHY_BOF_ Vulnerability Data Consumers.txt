Kind: captions Language: en All right, this is my one slide. Um, I All right, this is my one slide. Um, I All right, this is my one slide. Um, I really did want this to be a birds of a really did want this to be a birds of a really did want this to be a birds of a feather session. So, I'm really glad we feather session. So, I'm really glad we feather session. So, I'm really glad we got a nice cozy room to talk. Uh, I got a nice cozy room to talk. Uh, I got a nice cozy room to talk. Uh, I think this will be interesting. Uh, think this will be interesting. Uh, think this will be interesting. Uh, hopefully people with microphones have hopefully people with microphones have hopefully people with microphones have some good running shoes on. some good running shoes on. some good running shoes on. Um, so I, uh, have spent many years Um, so I, uh, have spent many years Um, so I, uh, have spent many years working with vulnerability data just to working with vulnerability data just to working with vulnerability data just to set the stage here. Uh, and so not only set the stage here. Uh, and so not only set the stage here. Uh, and so not only just direct CVE data, but you know, like just direct CVE data, but you know, like just direct CVE data, but you know, like from CV.org, but from NVD and all of the from CV.org, but from NVD and all of the from CV.org, but from NVD and all of the enrichment sources, all of the enrichment sources, all of the enrichment sources, all of the supplemental sources, so on and so supplemental sources, so on and so supplemental sources, so on and so forth. And there are forth. And there are forth. And there are some, let's use the word challenges with some, let's use the word challenges with some, let's use the word challenges with consuming vulnerability data. And uh, consuming vulnerability data. And uh, consuming vulnerability data. And uh, I've started to get involved with like I've started to get involved with like I've started to get involved with like the CVE working groups to try and help the CVE working groups to try and help the CVE working groups to try and help communicate some of those challenges and communicate some of those challenges and communicate some of those challenges and hopefully to alleviate and improve. But hopefully to alleviate and improve. But hopefully to alleviate and improve. But one of the things that we generally one of the things that we generally one of the things that we generally struggle with as we're trying to help struggle with as we're trying to help struggle with as we're trying to help people through the CVE program to people through the CVE program to people through the CVE program to consume this data is actually connecting consume this data is actually connecting consume this data is actually connecting with consumers to actually talk with with consumers to actually talk with with consumers to actually talk with other people. I've got my opinions uh other people. I've got my opinions uh other people. I've got my opinions uh and I will try to inject those when and I will try to inject those when and I will try to inject those when necessary but largely to connect with necessary but largely to connect with necessary but largely to connect with other people and to talk about the pain other people and to talk about the pain other people and to talk about the pain points that people are points that people are points that people are experiencing. And so just as a show of experiencing. And so just as a show of experiencing. And so just as a show of hands just real quick, how many people hands just real quick, how many people hands just real quick, how many people are are are ingesting CVE.org ingesting CVE.org ingesting CVE.org data? Awesome. This might be a really data? Awesome. This might be a really data? Awesome. This might be a really good discussion. NVD. Okay, great. That's a great start. NVD. Okay, great. That's a great start. NVD. Okay, great. That's a great start. I mean, this is vulnerability data, but I mean, this is vulnerability data, but I mean, this is vulnerability data, but of course there's a ton of other of course there's a ton of other of course there's a ton of other sources. There's OSV, the GitHub sources. There's OSV, the GitHub sources. There's OSV, the GitHub advisories, um, JPER, CNNVD, so on and advisories, um, JPER, CNNVD, so on and advisories, um, JPER, CNNVD, so on and so forth. there's all these other so forth. there's all these other so forth. there's all these other sources and there's all these different sources and there's all these different sources and there's all these different enrichment sources. And so these I put enrichment sources. And so these I put enrichment sources. And so these I put on the slides basically questions off on the slides basically questions off on the slides basically questions off the top of my head. Uh I put a as you the top of my head. Uh I put a as you the top of my head. Uh I put a as you can tell an enormous quantity of time can tell an enormous quantity of time can tell an enormous quantity of time into my slide work. And so I just want into my slide work. And so I just want into my slide work. And so I just want to kick things off and just like we can to kick things off and just like we can to kick things off and just like we can go in any direction here. Uh we could go in any direction here. Uh we could go in any direction here. Uh we could start at the top and work down. Does start at the top and work down. Does start at the top and work down. Does anybody have a preference? No. All right. Let's start preference? No. All right. Let's start preference? No. All right. Let's start with with with um like where where is where are your um like where where is where are your um like where where is where are your pain points? Where do people mainly pain points? Where do people mainly pain points? Where do people mainly struggle? Like where's the biggest struggle? Like where's the biggest struggle? Like where's the biggest problem? Is it with the data format? You problem? Is it with the data format? You problem? Is it with the data format? You know like st parsing XML versus JSON? A know like st parsing XML versus JSON? A know like st parsing XML versus JSON? A lot of the CVE data used to be in XML lot of the CVE data used to be in XML lot of the CVE data used to be in XML and now it's in JSON which was in my and now it's in JSON which was in my and now it's in JSON which was in my opinion a wonderful change. Um but do opinion a wonderful change. Um but do opinion a wonderful change. Um but do people struggle with that type of people struggle with that type of people struggle with that type of thing? Is that a challenge for anyone? thing? Is that a challenge for anyone? thing? Is that a challenge for anyone? Anyone a head nod? Anything? Having a Anyone a head nod? Anything? Having a Anyone a head nod? Anything? Having a good time parsing CV good time parsing CV good time parsing CV data? data? data? No. And why is that? Having a bad time. I'm putting someone on the spot time. I'm putting someone on the spot time. I'm putting someone on the spot for those for those for those remote. I'm trying to think of my remote. I'm trying to think of my remote. I'm trying to think of my experiences. Um but you know so I I my experiences. Um but you know so I I my experiences. Um but you know so I I my technology is bash and jq which I technology is bash and jq which I technology is bash and jq which I realize does not meet the that this realize does not meet the that this realize does not meet the that this shouldn't allow me in the room probably. shouldn't allow me in the room probably. shouldn't allow me in the room probably. That's great Stack Overflow. Um but uh I That's great Stack Overflow. Um but uh I That's great Stack Overflow. Um but uh I have a lot of error checking like is the have a lot of error checking like is the have a lot of error checking like is the field filled out or not or is the is the field filled out or not or is the is the field filled out or not or is the is the CWE character I expected are those CWE character I expected are those CWE character I expected are those characters here or the other field characters here or the other field characters here or the other field nearby? Um is the date missing that's nearby? Um is the date missing that's nearby? Um is the date missing that's supposed to be there? um there's an supposed to be there? um there's an supposed to be there? um there's an array inside of an array of a thing. So array inside of an array of a thing. So array inside of an array of a thing. So those are my very rough rough struggles those are my very rough rough struggles those are my very rough rough struggles and it's you know you learn but they're and it's you know you learn but they're and it's you know you learn but they're more like if ifs and loops and arrays more like if ifs and loops and arrays more like if ifs and loops and arrays than I would expect in parsing data and than I would expect in parsing data and than I would expect in parsing data and do you have that um for lack of a better do you have that um for lack of a better do you have that um for lack of a better term a lot of those are just one-offs. term a lot of those are just one-offs. term a lot of those are just one-offs. Um they might be but they're they're Um they might be but they're they're Um they might be but they're they're they're one-offs that I leave in my they're one-offs that I leave in my they're one-offs that I leave in my leave my checking in place right because leave my checking in place right because leave my checking in place right because I don't know when they're going to come I don't know when they're going to come I don't know when they're going to come back. Some got fixed, some didn't. back. Some got fixed, some didn't. back. Some got fixed, some didn't. Right. Uh like I know in the in the CVE Right. Uh like I know in the in the CVE Right. Uh like I know in the in the CVE records when you go in the effect records when you go in the effect records when you go in the effect affected section and you go for vendors affected section and you go for vendors affected section and you go for vendors and what is it? Version or something and what is it? Version or something and what is it? Version or something like it's NA. There's like I don't know like it's NA. There's like I don't know like it's NA. There's like I don't know a few tous thousands of records with a few tous thousands of records with a few tous thousands of records with NA. So, and so like I know for me like I NA. So, and so like I know for me like I NA. So, and so like I know for me like I write a one-off saying, "Hey, if the write a one-off saying, "Hey, if the write a one-off saying, "Hey, if the product says NA, just remove that and product says NA, just remove that and product says NA, just remove that and actually make it a missing field, not actually make it a missing field, not actually make it a missing field, not text N/ text N/ text N/ A." So, yeah. And so, that you were saying that yeah. And so, that you were saying that yeah. And so, that you were saying that other people do parse data. Does anybody other people do parse data. Does anybody other people do parse data. Does anybody else um have a favorite tool or like Art else um have a favorite tool or like Art else um have a favorite tool or like Art was saying how he uses JQ and Bash to was saying how he uses JQ and Bash to was saying how he uses JQ and Bash to get at this data? Yes sir. So my company get at this data? Yes sir. So my company get at this data? Yes sir. So my company uses we have an entire analytics team. uses we have an entire analytics team. uses we have an entire analytics team. They use a lot of Splunk stuff for a lot They use a lot of Splunk stuff for a lot They use a lot of Splunk stuff for a lot of our reporting. So we'll take a lot of of our reporting. So we'll take a lot of of our reporting. So we'll take a lot of these the data in from I guess CVE and these the data in from I guess CVE and these the data in from I guess CVE and it's it's good. Um do we store it it's it's good. Um do we store it it's it's good. Um do we store it locally? Yeah. Yeah, but we also locally? Yeah. Yeah, but we also locally? Yeah. Yeah, but we also override it because we do want to get override it because we do want to get override it because we do want to get those updates because again sometimes those updates because again sometimes those updates because again sometimes your score changes, your EPSS score can your score changes, your EPSS score can your score changes, your EPSS score can change and a lot of it just boils down change and a lot of it just boils down change and a lot of it just boils down to how do we use it? Um how do we use it to how do we use it? Um how do we use it to how do we use it? Um how do we use it to prioritize? There's 11 billion CVEes to prioritize? There's 11 billion CVEes to prioritize? There's 11 billion CVEes around there and some of them are old around there and some of them are old around there and some of them are old and we find new stuff too. So taking and we find new stuff too. So taking and we find new stuff too. So taking that uh and pairing with our lot of our that uh and pairing with our lot of our that uh and pairing with our lot of our vulnerability scanners, we're very often vulnerability scanners, we're very often vulnerability scanners, we're very often a secondary u consumer of the CVE data a secondary u consumer of the CVE data a secondary u consumer of the CVE data also because they do their waiting and also because they do their waiting and also because they do their waiting and because we have so many different because we have so many different because we have so many different scanning scanning scanning tools, we need to have some way to tools, we need to have some way to tools, we need to have some way to normalize everything and that's why my normalize everything and that's why my normalize everything and that's why my analytics team gets paid a whole lot of analytics team gets paid a whole lot of analytics team gets paid a whole lot of money. So yeah. Yeah, that's really money. So yeah. Yeah, that's really money. So yeah. Yeah, that's really interesting actually to talk about interesting actually to talk about interesting actually to talk about normalizing normalizing normalizing across all of the data sources. you know across all of the data sources. you know across all of the data sources. you know like if we take something like CVSS to like if we take something like CVSS to like if we take something like CVSS to normalize and I don't want to get away normalize and I don't want to get away normalize and I don't want to get away from the tool discussion real quick cuz from the tool discussion real quick cuz from the tool discussion real quick cuz you mentioned Splunk and I want to come you mentioned Splunk and I want to come you mentioned Splunk and I want to come back to that but you know something like back to that but you know something like back to that but you know something like CVSS where you may get like the primary CVSS where you may get like the primary CVSS where you may get like the primary CVE record the CNA will put CVSS in CVE record the CNA will put CVSS in CVE record the CNA will put CVSS in there and then you get NVD adding their there and then you get NVD adding their there and then you get NVD adding their version and then you go find that your version and then you go find that your version and then you go find that your vendor your tool vendor the scanner has vendor your tool vendor the scanner has vendor your tool vendor the scanner has its own CVS version in there or its own CVS version in there or its own CVS version in there or something like that and or none of the something like that and or none of the something like that and or none of the match you know and you've got that match you know and you've got that match you know and you've got that challenge right how do you how do you challenge right how do you how do you challenge right how do you how do you does anybody has anybody solved does anybody has anybody solved does anybody has anybody solved that and it was like I figured it out. So, uh there are just out. So, uh there are just out. So, uh there are just some good Yeah, there are some pain some good Yeah, there are some pain some good Yeah, there are some pain points mentioned in the discord. Um my points mentioned in the discord. Um my points mentioned in the discord. Um my trade does not enforce any CNA rules trade does not enforce any CNA rules trade does not enforce any CNA rules does no QA on the submissions and CVE does no QA on the submissions and CVE does no QA on the submissions and CVE descriptions are often pathetic. It's if descriptions are often pathetic. It's if descriptions are often pathetic. It's if not coming from the big vendors. not coming from the big vendors. not coming from the big vendors. Yep. Yep. Yep. there there. So, just to talk to that there there. So, just to talk to that there there. So, just to talk to that there there are some checks and um there there are some checks and um there there are some checks and um clearly there's a challenge with um data clearly there's a challenge with um data clearly there's a challenge with um data quality. Uh so yeah, I mean that person quality. Uh so yeah, I mean that person quality. Uh so yeah, I mean that person is true. I mean like there's a lot of is true. I mean like there's a lot of is true. I mean like there's a lot of the stuff is completely free text. Um, the stuff is completely free text. Um, the stuff is completely free text. Um, and that's something, you know, it's and that's something, you know, it's and that's something, you know, it's sort of a double-sided coin, though, sort of a double-sided coin, though, sort of a double-sided coin, though, because like if the the intake process because like if the the intake process because like if the the intake process became more difficult and more onious, became more difficult and more onious, became more difficult and more onious, then maybe CNAs would be less likely to then maybe CNAs would be less likely to then maybe CNAs would be less likely to participate. Um, but I agree. I mean, participate. Um, but I agree. I mean, participate. Um, but I agree. I mean, like we need some at least a higher like we need some at least a higher like we need some at least a higher level of minimum quality in here. And I level of minimum quality in here. And I level of minimum quality in here. And I think so for people working with data think so for people working with data think so for people working with data and there's a question here in the and there's a question here in the and there's a question here in the middle um but um one of the rules for middle um but um one of the rules for middle um but um one of the rules for like data scientists is that the the like data scientists is that the the like data scientists is that the the 8020 rule applies where you spend 80% of 8020 rule applies where you spend 80% of 8020 rule applies where you spend 80% of your time cleaning data and the other your time cleaning data and the other your time cleaning data and the other 20% complaining about the data. So 20% complaining about the data. So 20% complaining about the data. So that's the 8020 rule. But was there a that's the 8020 rule. But was there a that's the 8020 rule. But was there a follow maybe before on that same note follow maybe before on that same note follow maybe before on that same note Jay? Um so uh I think that talk earlier Jay? Um so uh I think that talk earlier Jay? Um so uh I think that talk earlier by Chris and Alec also mentioned that by Chris and Alec also mentioned that by Chris and Alec also mentioned that when you have imperfect data one of the when you have imperfect data one of the when you have imperfect data one of the ways that they circumvented it is by ways that they circumvented it is by ways that they circumvented it is by enriching it after the fact. But um um enriching it after the fact. But um um enriching it after the fact. But um um the the root cause maybe is again in the the the root cause maybe is again in the the the root cause maybe is again in the input. So, and there are the CNA rules input. So, and there are the CNA rules input. So, and there are the CNA rules and I think maybe art can talk to that, and I think maybe art can talk to that, and I think maybe art can talk to that, but um there as the discord guy but um there as the discord guy but um there as the discord guy mentioned or girl that they're not mentioned or girl that they're not mentioned or girl that they're not enforced. So, the question is and I enforced. So, the question is and I enforced. So, the question is and I understand there's probably a balance understand there's probably a balance understand there's probably a balance between you don't want to make the um between you don't want to make the um between you don't want to make the um too strict the pro the process too too strict the pro the process too too strict the pro the process too strict so that people won't submit strict so that people won't submit strict so that people won't submit vulnerabilities. Um but maybe there is a vulnerabilities. Um but maybe there is a vulnerabilities. Um but maybe there is a fine line that that can be met and and fine line that that can be met and and fine line that that can be met and and uh rejecting a submission that that has uh rejecting a submission that that has uh rejecting a submission that that has missing data to improve the the input. missing data to improve the the input. missing data to improve the the input. Right. Yeah. So so first saying that the Right. Yeah. So so first saying that the Right. Yeah. So so first saying that the um there are checks in place and those um there are checks in place and those um there are checks in place and those checks do run. I do think that they're checks do run. I do think that they're checks do run. I do think that they're uh that they can be raised up in uh that they can be raised up in uh that they can be raised up in quality. quality. quality. Yeah. Hi. Um to me I think my biggest Yeah. Hi. Um to me I think my biggest Yeah. Hi. Um to me I think my biggest problem has been keeping up with problem has been keeping up with problem has been keeping up with updates. Uh because most of the time we updates. Uh because most of the time we updates. Uh because most of the time we see vulnerabilities that maybe are see vulnerabilities that maybe are see vulnerabilities that maybe are medium severity and we say okay we'll medium severity and we say okay we'll medium severity and we say okay we'll deal with them later and then two weeks deal with them later and then two weeks deal with them later and then two weeks later they are now actively exploited. later they are now actively exploited. later they are now actively exploited. They've escalated to a critical and it's They've escalated to a critical and it's They've escalated to a critical and it's very hard to keep up with those to get very hard to keep up with those to get very hard to keep up with those to get get a notification get a get a notification get a get a notification get a a updated feed of updates if that makes a updated feed of updates if that makes a updated feed of updates if that makes sense. Um because the only way we found sense. Um because the only way we found sense. Um because the only way we found out is query it again and see if it out is query it again and see if it out is query it again and see if it changed and compare it manually. But if changed and compare it manually. But if changed and compare it manually. But if it's if there's 10,000 vulnerabilities, it's if there's 10,000 vulnerabilities, it's if there's 10,000 vulnerabilities, well, you got to query 10,000 times, well, you got to query 10,000 times, well, you got to query 10,000 times, right? Not Yeah. Do you do you have any right? Not Yeah. Do you do you have any right? Not Yeah. Do you do you have any solution to that? You know, so like solution to that? You know, so like solution to that? You know, so like things do update and the world does things do update and the world does things do update and the world does change. We do have to prepare for that. change. We do have to prepare for that. change. We do have to prepare for that. Do you have any solutions in place or Do you have any solutions in place or Do you have any solutions in place or you just check the data? Our solution you just check the data? Our solution you just check the data? Our solution has been relying on vendors that have has been relying on vendors that have has been relying on vendors that have this uh like thread threat feeds and try this uh like thread threat feeds and try this uh like thread threat feeds and try to aggregate data from uh other sources to aggregate data from uh other sources to aggregate data from uh other sources that track uh active active exploits. that track uh active active exploits. that track uh active active exploits. Yeah. Um and periodically checking back Yeah. Um and periodically checking back Yeah. Um and periodically checking back specifically I'm going to call out like specifically I'm going to call out like specifically I'm going to call out like Cisco, Microsoft, like those big vendors Cisco, Microsoft, like those big vendors Cisco, Microsoft, like those big vendors like checking if they have updated their like checking if they have updated their like checking if they have updated their previous month releases and see if previous month releases and see if previous month releases and see if there's anything that concerns us, there's anything that concerns us, there's anything that concerns us, right? But right we haven't found a a right? But right we haven't found a a right? But right we haven't found a a solution that is able to let's say solution that is able to let's say solution that is able to let's say notify us or have an easy way to just notify us or have an easy way to just notify us or have an easy way to just check what changed in the last month. check what changed in the last month. check what changed in the last month. Yeah. Yeah. And unfortunately it's it's Yeah. Yeah. And unfortunately it's it's Yeah. Yeah. And unfortunately it's it's I wouldn't quite call it a failing of I wouldn't quite call it a failing of I wouldn't quite call it a failing of like the data. I think that this is a like the data. I think that this is a like the data. I think that this is a state of the world that things update state of the world that things update state of the world that things update and we have to change our priorities and we have to change our priorities and we have to change our priorities daily. Um and I think I think we have daily. Um and I think I think we have daily. Um and I think I think we have some opportunity to improve how we're some opportunity to improve how we're some opportunity to improve how we're doing doing doing that. would be the correct way to say that. would be the correct way to say that. would be the correct way to say that. There's some questions up front that. There's some questions up front that. There's some questions up front here too. Yeah, back here. Um, so I here too. Yeah, back here. Um, so I here too. Yeah, back here. Um, so I think our biggest problem uh has has not think our biggest problem uh has has not think our biggest problem uh has has not been so much with the the data been so much with the the data been so much with the the data formatting so much as the data accuracy formatting so much as the data accuracy formatting so much as the data accuracy and the shift of the format over time and the shift of the format over time and the shift of the format over time leads to questions in the accuracy. So leads to questions in the accuracy. So leads to questions in the accuracy. So for example, um, say you have a CVE that for example, um, say you have a CVE that for example, um, say you have a CVE that applies to multiple configurations. The applies to multiple configurations. The applies to multiple configurations. The meaning of that seems to have changed meaning of that seems to have changed meaning of that seems to have changed over time. So you almost have to have a over time. So you almost have to have a over time. So you almost have to have a physical, you know, an expert read the physical, you know, an expert read the physical, you know, an expert read the description of the CVE to understand description of the CVE to understand description of the CVE to understand what those multiple configurations even what those multiple configurations even what those multiple configurations even mean. You know that if they they should mean. You know that if they they should mean. You know that if they they should be running on with but they just happen be running on with but they just happen be running on with but they just happen to list two configurations instead. Um to list two configurations instead. Um to list two configurations instead. Um things like that. And additionally the things like that. And additionally the things like that. And additionally the switch from version ranges to you know switch from version ranges to you know switch from version ranges to you know specified versions that change over has specified versions that change over has specified versions that change over has not been entirely accurate as well. And not been entirely accurate as well. And not been entirely accurate as well. And I don't I don't know of an additional I don't I don't know of an additional I don't I don't know of an additional source of information if there's um we source of information if there's um we source of information if there's um we we primarily go to NVD straight for our we primarily go to NVD straight for our we primarily go to NVD straight for our data. So I don't know if MITER has an data. So I don't know if MITER has an data. So I don't know if MITER has an additional source of information that additional source of information that additional source of information that corrects for any of that kind of corrects for any of that kind of corrects for any of that kind of accuracy issue. Yeah. So, real quick, I accuracy issue. Yeah. So, real quick, I accuracy issue. Yeah. So, real quick, I know that MITER has the pro or cve.org know that MITER has the pro or cve.org know that MITER has the pro or cve.org has the process. Uh, they're they've has the process. Uh, they're they've has the process. Uh, they're they've updated the schema already for the NVD updated the schema already for the NVD updated the schema already for the NVD CPE format. CPE format. CPE format. Yeah, that was 5.1.1 version, which was Yeah, that was 5.1.1 version, which was Yeah, that was 5.1.1 version, which was just a month or two ago. Um, and so part just a month or two ago. Um, and so part just a month or two ago. Um, and so part of the channel is like, yeah, we updated of the channel is like, yeah, we updated of the channel is like, yeah, we updated and so when in the NVD schema when CPE and so when in the NVD schema when CPE and so when in the NVD schema when CPE is defined, it's kind of a nice way that is defined, it's kind of a nice way that is defined, it's kind of a nice way that it's defined in there. And now the it's defined in there. And now the it's defined in there. And now the CV.org org data also does that for CPE CV.org org data also does that for CPE CV.org org data also does that for CPE data although it's a little bit less uh data although it's a little bit less uh data although it's a little bit less uh complete in there. Um but yes, I think complete in there. Um but yes, I think complete in there. Um but yes, I think data quality like that is a huge data quality like that is a huge data quality like that is a huge challenge. And I think one of the ways challenge. And I think one of the ways challenge. And I think one of the ways that I could see improving this moving that I could see improving this moving that I could see improving this moving forward is that if forward is that if forward is that if consumers like this we had more of a consumers like this we had more of a consumers like this we had more of a voice uh and we you know we if we had voice uh and we you know we if we had voice uh and we you know we if we had like a consumer union that we could you like a consumer union that we could you like a consumer union that we could you know help out and and provide feedback know help out and and provide feedback know help out and and provide feedback and say this is this is a really and say this is this is a really and say this is this is a really important thing to us. And actually, one important thing to us. And actually, one important thing to us. And actually, one of the things that I hope to get out of of the things that I hope to get out of of the things that I hope to get out of here, the last bullet point on my slide here, the last bullet point on my slide here, the last bullet point on my slide is how could a group like cv.org reach is how could a group like cv.org reach is how could a group like cv.org reach out. Um, for those who don't know, the out. Um, for those who don't know, the out. Um, for those who don't know, the quality working group has a GitHub repo quality working group has a GitHub repo quality working group has a GitHub repo where we've got issues open there. Um, where we've got issues open there. Um, where we've got issues open there. Um, open. Anybody can open an issue. Um, and open. Anybody can open an issue. Um, and open. Anybody can open an issue. Um, and there are 70 open right now. Uh, and there are 70 open right now. Uh, and there are 70 open right now. Uh, and we're considering a lot of upcoming we're considering a lot of upcoming we're considering a lot of upcoming changes. And one of the things that changes. And one of the things that changes. And one of the things that would be really cool is if people could would be really cool is if people could would be really cool is if people could could either get notified and or could could either get notified and or could could either get notified and or could respond to I don't know a survey or respond to I don't know a survey or respond to I don't know a survey or somehow provide input of like why are somehow provide input of like why are somehow provide input of like why are you guys considering that change that's you guys considering that change that's you guys considering that change that's stupid do this instead you know have stupid do this instead you know have stupid do this instead you know have that consumer feel to say like hey we've that consumer feel to say like hey we've that consumer feel to say like hey we've worked with this data and what you're worked with this data and what you're worked with this data and what you're saying is a terrible idea do this saying is a terrible idea do this saying is a terrible idea do this instead or what a great idea I would instead or what a great idea I would instead or what a great idea I would support that 100%. because that's one of support that 100%. because that's one of support that 100%. because that's one of the things I think that's been lacking the things I think that's been lacking the things I think that's been lacking in the past that there there's changes in the past that there there's changes in the past that there there's changes made because they seemed good to a made because they seemed good to a made because they seemed good to a select group of people with their own select group of people with their own select group of people with their own motivations and jobs and things like motivations and jobs and things like motivations and jobs and things like that and that that consumer spec that and that that consumer spec that and that that consumer spec perspective was somewhat lacking and so perspective was somewhat lacking and so perspective was somewhat lacking and so I think as consumers hopefully we can I think as consumers hopefully we can I think as consumers hopefully we can make our voices heard and I don't know make our voices heard and I don't know make our voices heard and I don't know what that looks like I don't know if what that looks like I don't know if what that looks like I don't know if anybody else has any ideas on how anybody else has any ideas on how anybody else has any ideas on how consumers can get their voices heard consumers can get their voices heard consumers can get their voices heard Yes, Ben, you got a quick question. So, Yes, Ben, you got a quick question. So, Yes, Ben, you got a quick question. So, I I just wanted to say the on the change I I just wanted to say the on the change I I just wanted to say the on the change thing, NVD does have a change log. It is thing, NVD does have a change log. It is thing, NVD does have a change log. It is incredibly hard to resolve. So, like incredibly hard to resolve. So, like incredibly hard to resolve. So, like even though it's there, it's even it's even though it's there, it's even it's even though it's there, it's even it's hard to kind of integrate that into your hard to kind of integrate that into your hard to kind of integrate that into your library. The cve.org also I mean the CVE library. The cve.org also I mean the CVE library. The cve.org also I mean the CVE list is also in GitHub, but resolving list is also in GitHub, but resolving list is also in GitHub, but resolving GitHub diffs into a JSON file is also GitHub diffs into a JSON file is also GitHub diffs into a JSON file is also not the easiest thing in the world. So a not the easiest thing in the world. So a not the easiest thing in the world. So a simpler way for a feed of changes I simpler way for a feed of changes I simpler way for a feed of changes I think would be a really positive. Yeah. think would be a really positive. Yeah. think would be a really positive. Yeah. The other thing that I struggle with is The other thing that I struggle with is The other thing that I struggle with is I spend most of my time taking nested uh I spend most of my time taking nested uh I spend most of my time taking nested uh arrayed data and making it flat. Uh arrayed data and making it flat. Uh arrayed data and making it flat. Uh because that's how I do analysis. That's because that's how I do analysis. That's because that's how I do analysis. That's how folks do visualization. And so how folks do visualization. And so how folks do visualization. And so rather than running JQ after JQs after rather than running JQ after JQs after rather than running JQ after JQs after JQ, I'd rather just have a flat file JQ, I'd rather just have a flat file JQ, I'd rather just have a flat file that I can work with, right? Um I don't that I can work with, right? Um I don't that I can work with, right? Um I don't know if a pipeline to output flat files know if a pipeline to output flat files know if a pipeline to output flat files would be uh use. I Okay, but that would would be uh use. I Okay, but that would would be uh use. I Okay, but that would be my suggestion. That would be what I be my suggestion. That would be what I be my suggestion. That would be what I would hope for is some some flat file would hope for is some some flat file would hope for is some some flat file pipeline. All right. So, uh Ben is going pipeline. All right. So, uh Ben is going pipeline. All right. So, uh Ben is going to open a new issue on our repo, Chris, to open a new issue on our repo, Chris, to open a new issue on our repo, Chris, for flat files. Um and I mean, I've got for flat files. Um and I mean, I've got for flat files. Um and I mean, I've got code to do that, Ben. Um yeah, me too. code to do that, Ben. Um yeah, me too. code to do that, Ben. Um yeah, me too. Um right. Yeah. So, that's it's a Um right. Yeah. So, that's it's a Um right. Yeah. So, that's it's a challenge. Um did you have a question challenge. Um did you have a question challenge. Um did you have a question that you wanted to or that you wanted to or that you wanted to or addition someone back there? Yeah, I addition someone back there? Yeah, I addition someone back there? Yeah, I want to go ahead and answer part of your want to go ahead and answer part of your want to go ahead and answer part of your question about uh how do we get question about uh how do we get question about uh how do we get consumers in here? Uh, one of the consumers in here? Uh, one of the consumers in here? Uh, one of the considerations I have for next year is considerations I have for next year is considerations I have for next year is to bring in some very large customer to bring in some very large customer to bring in some very large customer types for a day or two to actually help types for a day or two to actually help types for a day or two to actually help elicit what they want, what they need, elicit what they want, what they need, elicit what they want, what they need, right? And how we we do that. So, if you right? And how we we do that. So, if you right? And how we we do that. So, if you have thoughts along those lines, I'd have thoughts along those lines, I'd have thoughts along those lines, I'd like to hear more about that and put like to hear more about that and put like to hear more about that and put that in there. Great. What's that? that in there. Great. What's that? that in there. Great. What's that? Yeah. Uh there's a few more that are very big, Uh there's a few more that are very big, Uh there's a few more that are very big, but I'll talk with you on that one. but I'll talk with you on that one. but I'll talk with you on that one. Okay, we have a question back here Okay, we have a question back here Okay, we have a question back here still. still. still. Okay. Uh in order for me to get the Okay. Uh in order for me to get the Okay. Uh in order for me to get the actual MVD data, and it's not alone on actual MVD data, and it's not alone on actual MVD data, and it's not alone on some of these data feeds, uh to backfill some of these data feeds, uh to backfill some of these data feeds, uh to backfill this, like I've got to iterate through this, like I've got to iterate through this, like I've got to iterate through the APIs, and there used to be a legacy the APIs, and there used to be a legacy the APIs, and there used to be a legacy 1.1 data feed where I could just pop it 1.1 data feed where I could just pop it 1.1 data feed where I could just pop it down in one file. Yep. 2.0 and above and down in one file. Yep. 2.0 and above and down in one file. Yep. 2.0 and above and some of these data feeds like I don't some of these data feeds like I don't some of these data feeds like I don't have a way to just dump all the data and have a way to just dump all the data and have a way to just dump all the data and then start my deltas. Yep. It would be then start my deltas. Yep. It would be then start my deltas. Yep. It would be nice if that was, you know, there nice if that was, you know, there nice if that was, you know, there because I've got a lot of systems that I because I've got a lot of systems that I because I've got a lot of systems that I need to backfill and I keep doing the need to backfill and I keep doing the need to backfill and I keep doing the same work over and over again. same work over and over again. same work over and over again. Yeah. I Yeah. Yeah. I Yeah. Yeah. I Yeah. Um I don't have anything to add to that. Um I don't have anything to add to that. Um I don't have anything to add to that. That would be cool. I would I would also That would be cool. I would I would also That would be cool. I would I would also That would be fantastic. And then the That would be fantastic. And then the That would be fantastic. And then the the the question I wanted to ask you is the the question I wanted to ask you is the the question I wanted to ask you is is mapping between the is mapping between the is mapping between the vulnerabilities and threat intelligence vulnerabilities and threat intelligence vulnerabilities and threat intelligence in that threat landscape. I'm curious, in that threat landscape. I'm curious, in that threat landscape. I'm curious, you know, if you've approached it, your you know, if you've approached it, your you know, if you've approached it, your thoughts on that topic. Um it kind of thoughts on that topic. Um it kind of thoughts on that topic. Um it kind of seems to be the next evolution of of seems to be the next evolution of of seems to be the next evolution of of vulnerability management. Yeah. When you vulnerability management. Yeah. When you vulnerability management. Yeah. When you say what are the bad guys doing? What is say what are the bad guys doing? What is say what are the bad guys doing? What is what is the like what is the bad guy what is the like what is the bad guy what is the like what is the bad guy doing? Was that the last part you said? doing? Was that the last part you said? doing? Was that the last part you said? Okay. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. So, so I I don't know if everybody knows So, so I I don't know if everybody knows So, so I I don't know if everybody knows this. I help run EPSS and we score this. I help run EPSS and we score this. I help run EPSS and we score things daily like that and to track what things daily like that and to track what things daily like that and to track what the bad guys are doing that we made a the bad guys are doing that we made a the bad guys are doing that we made a concession that we're only going to look concession that we're only going to look concession that we're only going to look for CV IDs for that reason because if we for CV IDs for that reason because if we for CV IDs for that reason because if we go look at thread intel and you get you go look at thread intel and you get you go look at thread intel and you get you know depending on the vendor depending know depending on the vendor depending know depending on the vendor depending on the source you get 15 different names on the source you get 15 different names on the source you get 15 different names from 14 vendors you know um it's really from 14 vendors you know um it's really from 14 vendors you know um it's really challenging so I think one of the things challenging so I think one of the things challenging so I think one of the things that I wanted to do with EPSS and I that I wanted to do with EPSS and I that I wanted to do with EPSS and I think in general is we have to support think in general is we have to support think in general is we have to support the process Even if we think CVEes are the process Even if we think CVEes are the process Even if we think CVEes are broken or nasty or ugly, whatever it is, broken or nasty or ugly, whatever it is, broken or nasty or ugly, whatever it is, let's support that and make it better. let's support that and make it better. let's support that and make it better. And therefore, a year from now, And therefore, a year from now, And therefore, a year from now, hopefully or two or five years from now, hopefully or two or five years from now, hopefully or two or five years from now, we're going to be in a better place we're going to be in a better place we're going to be in a better place where we're going to be able to find where we're going to be able to find where we're going to be able to find more about what the bad guys is doing more about what the bad guys is doing more about what the bad guys is doing because we're tracking those IDs. Um, because we're tracking those IDs. Um, because we're tracking those IDs. Um, and so that's that was my quick rant. and so that's that was my quick rant. and so that's that was my quick rant. So, yeah, up here. Hey, sorry. Um, yeah. So, yeah, up here. Hey, sorry. Um, yeah. So, yeah, up here. Hey, sorry. Um, yeah. So, it's funny all the talks about this So, it's funny all the talks about this So, it's funny all the talks about this because I've been meaning actually to because I've been meaning actually to because I've been meaning actually to bring it up in the QWG as a potential bring it up in the QWG as a potential bring it up in the QWG as a potential solution for some of this and I wasn't solution for some of this and I wasn't solution for some of this and I wasn't sure how many people also are all doing sure how many people also are all doing sure how many people also are all doing the same thing, but it sounds like the same thing, but it sounds like the same thing, but it sounds like everybody who's consuming this data has everybody who's consuming this data has everybody who's consuming this data has their own bespoke processes for their own bespoke processes for their own bespoke processes for normalizing and flattening, pulling out normalizing and flattening, pulling out normalizing and flattening, pulling out the same stuff and it's all probably the same stuff and it's all probably the same stuff and it's all probably pretty similar until at least, you know, pretty similar until at least, you know, pretty similar until at least, you know, a few forks in the road. Um, and like a few forks in the road. Um, and like a few forks in the road. Um, and like for me, the biggest data problems is, for me, the biggest data problems is, for me, the biggest data problems is, you know, kind of the the signal versus you know, kind of the the signal versus you know, kind of the the signal versus noise. You kind of have to consume noise. You kind of have to consume noise. You kind of have to consume everything and then pair down. And then everything and then pair down. And then everything and then pair down. And then there's also just the frequency, the there's also just the frequency, the there's also just the frequency, the updates, and even just the model of updates, and even just the model of updates, and even just the model of polling, right? Yeah. Like reading polling, right? Yeah. Like reading polling, right? Yeah. Like reading GitHub diffs or, you know, manually GitHub diffs or, you know, manually GitHub diffs or, you know, manually managing your own. Um, and so I like managing your own. Um, and so I like managing your own. Um, and so I like that you invited someone to open an that you invited someone to open an that you invited someone to open an issue. I am going to open an issue today issue. I am going to open an issue today issue. I am going to open an issue today on it. Yeah. Um, but I do think I when I on it. Yeah. Um, but I do think I when I on it. Yeah. Um, but I do think I when I think of this and when I first joined think of this and when I first joined think of this and when I first joined the quality group like the the most the quality group like the the most the quality group like the the most simplistic solution seems to be simplistic solution seems to be simplistic solution seems to be something that flips the model instead something that flips the model instead something that flips the model instead of having to necessarily like overtly of having to necessarily like overtly of having to necessarily like overtly pull especially from like a repo or pull especially from like a repo or pull especially from like a repo or scanning all of it is to doing some sort scanning all of it is to doing some sort scanning all of it is to doing some sort of event stream, right? Something that of event stream, right? Something that of event stream, right? Something that people can consume, you know, as people can consume, you know, as people can consume, you know, as information comes along and kick off information comes along and kick off information comes along and kick off whatever process they specifically need. whatever process they specifically need. whatever process they specifically need. Yeah. And so, you know, and I I might Yeah. And so, you know, and I I might Yeah. And so, you know, and I I might even push for an and of that, like even push for an and of that, like even push for an and of that, like you've got this and that and Yeah. Yeah. you've got this and that and Yeah. Yeah. you've got this and that and Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. One of many options, right? But, Yeah. One of many options, right? But, Yeah. One of many options, right? But, but, you know, if you could if we can but, you know, if you could if we can but, you know, if you could if we can start to funnel things down so that start to funnel things down so that start to funnel things down so that specific events, you know, come along specific events, you know, come along specific events, you know, come along and they kick off our process and we can and they kick off our process and we can and they kick off our process and we can enrich it, I think that'll make a lot enrich it, I think that'll make a lot enrich it, I think that'll make a lot less duplication and a lot more open less duplication and a lot more open less duplication and a lot more open Yeah. sharing of this information. in Yeah. sharing of this information. in Yeah. sharing of this information. in the beginning part of your statement too the beginning part of your statement too the beginning part of your statement too talking about the the challenges in the talking about the the challenges in the talking about the the challenges in the volume and the signal to noise ratio and volume and the signal to noise ratio and volume and the signal to noise ratio and in my mind like I sort of want all of in my mind like I sort of want all of in my mind like I sort of want all of that noise initially like I want that that noise initially like I want that that noise initially like I want that floodgate opened and then through floodgate opened and then through floodgate opened and then through different techniques I'm going to different techniques I'm going to different techniques I'm going to whittle down to the signal um but like I whittle down to the signal um but like I whittle down to the signal um but like I don't want anybody to decide for me what don't want anybody to decide for me what don't want anybody to decide for me what is signal versus noise which is always a is signal versus noise which is always a is signal versus noise which is always a challenge in data you get people like challenge in data you get people like challenge in data you get people like I'm going to be helpful and clean this I'm going to be helpful and clean this I'm going to be helpful and clean this up for them you know and they drop like up for them you know and they drop like up for them you know and they drop like half the important fields um so yeah I I half the important fields um so yeah I I half the important fields um so yeah I I like sort of that fire hose coming in like sort of that fire hose coming in like sort of that fire hose coming in and as in my data collection I accept and as in my data collection I accept and as in my data collection I accept that and I'm like yes these are that and I'm like yes these are that and I'm like yes these are floodgates they're coming in I need to floodgates they're coming in I need to floodgates they're coming in I need to deal with it disk is cheap throw it in deal with it disk is cheap throw it in deal with it disk is cheap throw it in there. So hi yes Lord uh from CISA first there. So hi yes Lord uh from CISA first there. So hi yes Lord uh from CISA first of all thank you for organizing this I of all thank you for organizing this I of all thank you for organizing this I think this is uh these bots can be think this is uh these bots can be think this is uh these bots can be incredibly productive so thank you for incredibly productive so thank you for incredibly productive so thank you for that. Um and then you know I want to go that. Um and then you know I want to go that. Um and then you know I want to go back and echo and amplify and plus one back and echo and amplify and plus one back and echo and amplify and plus one some of the things that you were saying some of the things that you were saying some of the things that you were saying and some of the other folks were saying. and some of the other folks were saying. and some of the other folks were saying. So I think of the CVE program as a So I think of the CVE program as a So I think of the CVE program as a product and so the product needs to have product and so the product needs to have product and so the product needs to have some customers. When I start looking at some customers. When I start looking at some customers. When I start looking at this I see first order customers which this I see first order customers which this I see first order customers which are usually tools and they're also are usually tools and they're also are usually tools and they're also researchers like yourselves and Ben and researchers like yourselves and Ben and researchers like yourselves and Ben and many others. And so that's one customer many others. And so that's one customer many others. And so that's one customer and I think we need to get much more and I think we need to get much more and I think we need to get much more rigorous about how we talk and think rigorous about how we talk and think rigorous about how we talk and think about that. And then I also think about about that. And then I also think about about that. And then I also think about the downstream customers and putting my the downstream customers and putting my the downstream customers and putting my old CISO hat back on. I was one of those old CISO hat back on. I was one of those old CISO hat back on. I was one of those customers there. Millions literally customers there. Millions literally customers there. Millions literally millions Yeah. of organizations and millions Yeah. of organizations and millions Yeah. of organizations and individuals who want to reduce their individuals who want to reduce their individuals who want to reduce their risk. And today, by the way, spoiler risk. And today, by the way, spoiler risk. And today, by the way, spoiler alert, so I help run the secure by alert, so I help run the secure by alert, so I help run the secure by design program at Cisco, so this will be design program at Cisco, so this will be design program at Cisco, so this will be my mytick. There are too many my mytick. There are too many my mytick. There are too many vulnerabilities for us to patch. And so vulnerabilities for us to patch. And so vulnerabilities for us to patch. And so we have to come up with with some sort we have to come up with with some sort we have to come up with with some sort of way of coping with all this uns of way of coping with all this uns of way of coping with all this uns unsafe software. When you go back and unsafe software. When you go back and unsafe software. When you go back and take a look at what product managers do, take a look at what product managers do, take a look at what product managers do, really good product managers, they really good product managers, they really good product managers, they become obsessive. like they'll say the become obsessive. like they'll say the become obsessive. like they'll say the word obsessive with the customer word obsessive with the customer word obsessive with the customer understanding what the customer's understanding what the customer's understanding what the customer's problems are and they can be a weird problems are and they can be a weird problems are and they can be a weird bunch to be honest and I guess we're bunch to be honest and I guess we're bunch to be honest and I guess we're we're a weird bunch in our own way but we're a weird bunch in our own way but we're a weird bunch in our own way but the but really good product managers are the but really good product managers are the but really good product managers are obsessive about talking to the obsessive about talking to the obsessive about talking to the customers. So guess my question uh more customers. So guess my question uh more customers. So guess my question uh more of a seed to plant with you but maybe of a seed to plant with you but maybe of a seed to plant with you but maybe you have an idea. How do we not just get you have an idea. How do we not just get you have an idea. How do we not just get a couple of customers once a year? How a couple of customers once a year? How a couple of customers once a year? How do we get five customer interviews per do we get five customer interviews per do we get five customer interviews per week every week and try to figure out week every week and try to figure out week every week and try to figure out what are the common problems? Because I what are the common problems? Because I what are the common problems? Because I think the problems that we we predict think the problems that we we predict think the problems that we we predict that they'll have are often going to be that they'll have are often going to be that they'll have are often going to be very different. I did this twice with very different. I did this twice with very different. I did this twice with CISOs from major companies last week. CISOs from major companies last week. CISOs from major companies last week. The things they told me they didn't like The things they told me they didn't like The things they told me they didn't like about the CV program are not the things about the CV program are not the things about the CV program are not the things we've been arguing about. And so I think we've been arguing about. And so I think we've been arguing about. And so I think we just have a great opportunity to we just have a great opportunity to we just have a great opportunity to become good product managers and to become good product managers and to become good product managers and to think much more about what those think much more about what those think much more about what those downstream customers and their customers downstream customers and their customers downstream customers and their customers are running into. So I don't know if you are running into. So I don't know if you are running into. So I don't know if you have any particular thoughts on that, have any particular thoughts on that, have any particular thoughts on that, but but I'd love to continue the but but I'd love to continue the but but I'd love to continue the dialogue. I I couldn't agree with more dialogue. I I couldn't agree with more dialogue. I I couldn't agree with more with everything you just said. Um but we with everything you just said. Um but we with everything you just said. Um but we do have like two three minutes left, two do have like two three minutes left, two do have like two three minutes left, two or three minutes and solve it. Um I or three minutes and solve it. Um I or three minutes and solve it. Um I think an important thing in the last two think an important thing in the last two think an important thing in the last two minutes, how do we continue this? How minutes, how do we continue this? How minutes, how do we continue this? How how how can we all keep talking? How do how how can we all keep talking? How do how how can we all keep talking? How do we reach the people that aren't here we reach the people that aren't here we reach the people that aren't here that like Bob was talking about that that like Bob was talking about that that like Bob was talking about that that have stuff to contribute? Does that have stuff to contribute? Does that have stuff to contribute? Does anybody have any ideas like a mailing anybody have any ideas like a mailing anybody have any ideas like a mailing list, Slack, um a LinkedIn group, what list, Slack, um a LinkedIn group, what list, Slack, um a LinkedIn group, what GitHub issues? Um there is the quality GitHub issues? Um there is the quality GitHub issues? Um there is the quality working group which would be the primary working group which would be the primary working group which would be the primary target to take some of this consumer target to take some of this consumer target to take some of this consumer feedback. Um definitely I think you know feedback. Um definitely I think you know feedback. Um definitely I think you know if people are interested I don't want to if people are interested I don't want to if people are interested I don't want to say join because I don't know what the say join because I don't know what the say join because I don't know what the official process is for joining but um official process is for joining but um official process is for joining but um but there's definitely the GitHub repos but there's definitely the GitHub repos but there's definitely the GitHub repos there's discussions there um anything there's discussions there um anything there's discussions there um anything that you have there also just reach out that you have there also just reach out that you have there also just reach out to me I'm on LinkedIn you know like I'd to me I'm on LinkedIn you know like I'd to me I'm on LinkedIn you know like I'd be happy to connect and talk more about be happy to connect and talk more about be happy to connect and talk more about this but I I think it'd be really cool this but I I think it'd be really cool this but I I think it'd be really cool if we did have some way to continue this if we did have some way to continue this if we did have some way to continue this discussion to talk about what you all discussion to talk about what you all discussion to talk about what you all would want and what what I see too. And would want and what what I see too. And would want and what what I see too. And how does how do these line how does how do these line how does how do these line up? So, anyone have any other last up? So, anyone have any other last up? So, anyone have any other last closing thoughts? I think we're at time. closing thoughts? I think we're at time. closing thoughts? I think we're at time. There was a lot of good discussion in There was a lot of good discussion in There was a lot of good discussion in the Discord channel. Oh, good, good. the Discord channel. Oh, good, good. the Discord channel. Oh, good, good. I'll have to go look at that. And I I'll have to go look at that. And I I'll have to go look at that. And I think we have lunch on the other side of think we have lunch on the other side of think we have lunch on the other side of this. All right. So, maybe if anybody this. All right. So, maybe if anybody this. All right. So, maybe if anybody has questions, they can talk to you has questions, they can talk to you has questions, they can talk to you then. All right. Thanks, everyone.
