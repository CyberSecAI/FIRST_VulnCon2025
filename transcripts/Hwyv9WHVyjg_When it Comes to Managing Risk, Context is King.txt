Uh, Lucas Maidar. Uh, I'm a everyone. Uh, Lucas Maidar. Uh, I'm a quick introduction. Uh, so I've been in quick introduction. Uh, so I've been in quick introduction. Uh, so I've been in vulnerability management for over 16 vulnerability management for over 16 vulnerability management for over 16 years uh, with Tenable. Um, I'm in the years uh, with Tenable. Um, I'm in the years uh, with Tenable. Um, I'm in the research organization. Uh, our number research organization. Uh, our number research organization. Uh, our number one focus is writing plugins that, uh, one focus is writing plugins that, uh, one focus is writing plugins that, uh, are used for scanning for are used for scanning for are used for scanning for vulnerabilities. Um, well, I've never vulnerabilities. Um, well, I've never vulnerabilities. Um, well, I've never been a practitioner patching things, been a practitioner patching things, been a practitioner patching things, scanning for, you know, in my scanning for, you know, in my scanning for, you know, in my environment. We have a lot of similar environment. We have a lot of similar environment. We have a lot of similar challenges to what our customers deal challenges to what our customers deal challenges to what our customers deal with. Uh, um, too many vulnerabilities, with. Uh, um, too many vulnerabilities, with. Uh, um, too many vulnerabilities, not knowing what to cover, how to cover not knowing what to cover, how to cover not knowing what to cover, how to cover the right ones, getting the coverage the right ones, getting the coverage the right ones, getting the coverage out. Uh, I've been responsible for out. Uh, I've been responsible for out. Uh, I've been responsible for helping shape both our tactical response helping shape both our tactical response helping shape both our tactical response to emerging vulnerabilities, emerging to emerging vulnerabilities, emerging to emerging vulnerabilities, emerging risks, that things that everyone's risks, that things that everyone's risks, that things that everyone's screaming about, and a long-term screaming about, and a long-term screaming about, and a long-term strategy for our content. How do we get strategy for our content. How do we get strategy for our content. How do we get as much out as we can? Making sure it's as much out as we can? Making sure it's as much out as we can? Making sure it's accurate, making sure it's good. Um, accurate, making sure it's good. Um, accurate, making sure it's good. Um, help develop our internal vulnerability help develop our internal vulnerability help develop our internal vulnerability database that gives us the context that database that gives us the context that database that gives us the context that helps us make the right decisions. Uh, helps us make the right decisions. Uh, helps us make the right decisions. Uh, making sure we cover what's making sure we cover what's making sure we cover what's important. Um, I had a professor in important. Um, I had a professor in important. Um, I had a professor in college. I said, "The only way to college. I said, "The only way to college. I said, "The only way to guarantee security of a system in the guarantee security of a system in the guarantee security of a system in the face of a truly motivated attacker, bury face of a truly motivated attacker, bury face of a truly motivated attacker, bury it in a bunker, cut it off from the it in a bunker, cut it off from the it in a bunker, cut it off from the internet, and you're in good shape." internet, and you're in good shape." internet, and you're in good shape." Unfortunately, it's not very useful at Unfortunately, it's not very useful at Unfortunately, it's not very useful at that point. Uh so the reality is uh and that point. Uh so the reality is uh and that point. Uh so the reality is uh and there's some degree of truth to this. Uh there's some degree of truth to this. Uh there's some degree of truth to this. Uh this year we saw an attack where uh uh this year we saw an attack where uh uh this year we saw an attack where uh uh nearest neighbor attack a the APD28 nearest neighbor attack a the APD28 nearest neighbor attack a the APD28 compromised one business that was next compromised one business that was next compromised one business that was next door to their target jumped from that door to their target jumped from that door to their target jumped from that business over the wireless network to business over the wireless network to business over the wireless network to the target and compromised them that the target and compromised them that the target and compromised them that way. So 3,000 miles away they still got way. So 3,000 miles away they still got way. So 3,000 miles away they still got in uh bypass any firewalls. So there in uh bypass any firewalls. So there in uh bypass any firewalls. So there really is a you know targeted attacker really is a you know targeted attacker really is a you know targeted attacker is going to find a way in. Uh so the is going to find a way in. Uh so the is going to find a way in. Uh so the reality is everything we do is managing reality is everything we do is managing reality is everything we do is managing risk. There's risk of applying a patch. risk. There's risk of applying a patch. risk. There's risk of applying a patch. We've seen plenty of patches that are We've seen plenty of patches that are We've seen plenty of patches that are published. You go install it and published. You go install it and published. You go install it and suddenly your printers aren't working or suddenly your printers aren't working or suddenly your printers aren't working or your servers aren't working. At the same your servers aren't working. At the same your servers aren't working. At the same time if you don't apply a patch you time if you don't apply a patch you time if you don't apply a patch you might get compromised. So everything we might get compromised. So everything we might get compromised. So everything we do is making choices on risk risk do is making choices on risk risk do is making choices on risk risk management trading off risk. management trading off risk. management trading off risk. Uh there's uh high level there's kind of Uh there's uh high level there's kind of Uh there's uh high level there's kind of two focus areas that I look at. There's two focus areas that I look at. There's two focus areas that I look at. There's a tactical response when there's an a tactical response when there's an a tactical response when there's an emerging threat when everyone's talking emerging threat when everyone's talking emerging threat when everyone's talking about log for shell want to cry any of about log for shell want to cry any of about log for shell want to cry any of these how do you respond to that? How do these how do you respond to that? How do these how do you respond to that? How do you make sure that if someone says how's you make sure that if someone says how's you make sure that if someone says how's this affect us? What what should we do this affect us? What what should we do this affect us? What what should we do about it? Can you give them the right about it? Can you give them the right about it? Can you give them the right response that is uh you know well response that is uh you know well response that is uh you know well thought out, clear and not causing a thought out, clear and not causing a thought out, clear and not causing a panic at the same time. Uh on the flip panic at the same time. Uh on the flip panic at the same time. Uh on the flip side there's also the strategic side there's also the strategic side there's also the strategic planning. is how do you build a program planning. is how do you build a program planning. is how do you build a program long term that manages the risk that you long term that manages the risk that you long term that manages the risk that you can show you're reducing risk without can show you're reducing risk without can show you're reducing risk without burning people out telling them to go burning people out telling them to go burning people out telling them to go patch every single thing uh because we patch every single thing uh because we patch every single thing uh because we all know we can't do that. Um how do you all know we can't do that. Um how do you all know we can't do that. Um how do you do that in a way that you can do that in a way that you can do that in a way that you can measure? Uh so I think we all know this measure? Uh so I think we all know this measure? Uh so I think we all know this uh but this is kind of a chart of the uh but this is kind of a chart of the uh but this is kind of a chart of the growth of CVS per year. Uh to date growth of CVS per year. Uh to date growth of CVS per year. Uh to date there's been over 285,000 CVs published there's been over 285,000 CVs published there's been over 285,000 CVs published through the CV program. Averaged out through the CV program. Averaged out through the CV program. Averaged out doesn't seem too bad. you know, it's 26 doesn't seem too bad. you know, it's 26 doesn't seem too bad. you know, it's 26 27 years, that's 11,000 a year, but it's 27 years, that's 11,000 a year, but it's 27 years, that's 11,000 a year, but it's accelerated. Uh, and you'd see uh 2017 accelerated. Uh, and you'd see uh 2017 accelerated. Uh, and you'd see uh 2017 there was a huge jump. Uh, I remember it there was a huge jump. Uh, I remember it there was a huge jump. Uh, I remember it was just a huge catchup. The program was just a huge catchup. The program was just a huge catchup. The program kind of matured. They got some processes kind of matured. They got some processes kind of matured. They got some processes in place. So, a whole bunch of CVS came in place. So, a whole bunch of CVS came in place. So, a whole bunch of CVS came out and it's accelerated since then. Uh, out and it's accelerated since then. Uh, out and it's accelerated since then. Uh, it took 16 years to hit 5,000 uh um per it took 16 years to hit 5,000 uh um per it took 16 years to hit 5,000 uh um per year. Uh, and then or sorry, it took 19 year. Uh, and then or sorry, it took 19 year. Uh, and then or sorry, it took 19 years to hit 10,000 CVs per year. From years to hit 10,000 CVs per year. From years to hit 10,000 CVs per year. From there, it was only another five years. there, it was only another five years. there, it was only another five years. We were at 20. Uh I talked about this We were at 20. Uh I talked about this We were at 20. Uh I talked about this last year and I was saying, you know, we last year and I was saying, you know, we last year and I was saying, you know, we might hit 30,000 this year. Well, we're might hit 30,000 this year. Well, we're might hit 30,000 this year. Well, we're we're right around 40,000 this year uh we're right around 40,000 this year uh we're right around 40,000 this year uh from 2024. No one is keeping up with from 2024. No one is keeping up with from 2024. No one is keeping up with that. Uh it's just not possible. Um now what I see a lot, you possible. Um now what I see a lot, you possible. Um now what I see a lot, you know, working with customers, working know, working with customers, working know, working with customers, working with partners, working with everyone is with partners, working with everyone is with partners, working with everyone is a lot of people do what can be a lot of people do what can be a lot of people do what can be considered compliance-based considered compliance-based considered compliance-based vulnerability management. You've got vulnerability management. You've got vulnerability management. You've got your, you know, you got your program in your, you know, you got your program in your, you know, you got your program in place that is, you know, you've got a place that is, you know, you've got a place that is, you know, you've got a set of rules, whether it's internally set of rules, whether it's internally set of rules, whether it's internally driven or some policy you're trying to driven or some policy you're trying to driven or some policy you're trying to adhere to outside. You've, you're adhere to outside. You've, you're adhere to outside. You've, you're basically doing compliance uh uh basically doing compliance uh uh basically doing compliance uh uh vulnerability management. A lot of that vulnerability management. A lot of that vulnerability management. A lot of that is CVS high critical and it feels like is CVS high critical and it feels like is CVS high critical and it feels like pushing a rock up a never- ending hill. pushing a rock up a never- ending hill. pushing a rock up a never- ending hill. You're never going to finish. You're You're never going to finish. You're You're never going to finish. You're never going to make progress. Uh, and never going to make progress. Uh, and never going to make progress. Uh, and the reality is it's because the rate at the reality is it's because the rate at the reality is it's because the rate at which new high-end critical which new high-end critical which new high-end critical vulnerabilities are published vulnerabilities are published vulnerabilities are published essentially cancels out any work you've essentially cancels out any work you've essentially cancels out any work you've done. You go, you fix a bunch of things, done. You go, you fix a bunch of things, done. You go, you fix a bunch of things, you get all your patches applied, and you get all your patches applied, and you get all your patches applied, and you wake up the next morning and there's you wake up the next morning and there's you wake up the next morning and there's a whole another set. Like I said, we a whole another set. Like I said, we a whole another set. Like I said, we have the same thing in research. We get have the same thing in research. We get have the same thing in research. We get a whole bunch of plugins out, get a whole bunch of plugins out, get a whole bunch of plugins out, get coverage out, and wake up the next coverage out, and wake up the next coverage out, and wake up the next morning, you got to do it all over morning, you got to do it all over morning, you got to do it all over again. Even when you do make some again. Even when you do make some again. Even when you do make some apparent progress, you can't really apparent progress, you can't really apparent progress, you can't really prove that you're reducing risk. uh we prove that you're reducing risk. uh we prove that you're reducing risk. uh we all know you know CVSS um is is not all know you know CVSS um is is not all know you know CVSS um is is not necessarily going to measure risk. It's necessarily going to measure risk. It's necessarily going to measure risk. It's not uh that was never its intent. Um not uh that was never its intent. Um not uh that was never its intent. Um uh now the reason I think a lot of uh now the reason I think a lot of uh now the reason I think a lot of organizations use CBSS use this uh as organizations use CBSS use this uh as organizations use CBSS use this uh as sort of the approach is a it's based on sort of the approach is a it's based on sort of the approach is a it's based on an industry standard. So it's an easy an industry standard. So it's an easy an industry standard. So it's an easy one to point to satisfies there's some one to point to satisfies there's some one to point to satisfies there's some compliance requirements but even those compliance requirements but even those compliance requirements but even those are loose the only concrete one is PCI are loose the only concrete one is PCI are loose the only concrete one is PCI for inscope uh uh systems the real for inscope uh uh systems the real for inscope uh uh systems the real scores are easy to work with you can scores are easy to work with you can scores are easy to work with you can measure them you can put them in a measure them you can put them in a measure them you can put them in a spreadsheet you can sort you can filter spreadsheet you can sort you can filter spreadsheet you can sort you can filter you can do all that so it's really easy you can do all that so it's really easy you can do all that so it's really easy to kind of put those in a spreadsheet to kind of put those in a spreadsheet to kind of put those in a spreadsheet and track uh and you don't have to and track uh and you don't have to and track uh and you don't have to understand all the details and all the understand all the details and all the understand all the details and all the context you build a report and you issue context you build a report and you issue context you build a report and you issue it so it's it's a natural starting point it so it's it's a natural starting point it so it's it's a natural starting point where you're building up your knowledge where you're building up your knowledge where you're building up your knowledge trying to figure out how to go about trying to figure out how to go about trying to figure out how to go about But the reality is uh and they even have But the reality is uh and they even have But the reality is uh and they even have it now in you know when they introduced it now in you know when they introduced it now in you know when they introduced CBSS3 it was never intended to measure CBSS3 it was never intended to measure CBSS3 it was never intended to measure risk. risk. risk. Um it's used it's a severity metric for Um it's used it's a severity metric for Um it's used it's a severity metric for prioritization. Now when you use it to prioritization. Now when you use it to prioritization. Now when you use it to prioritize overall you're essentially prioritize overall you're essentially prioritize overall you're essentially treating it as risk if you're trying to treating it as risk if you're trying to treating it as risk if you're trying to reduce risk. Um it's essentially telling reduce risk. Um it's essentially telling reduce risk. Um it's essentially telling us if this vulnerability was exploited us if this vulnerability was exploited us if this vulnerability was exploited here's how bad it's going to be. you here's how bad it's going to be. you here's how bad it's going to be. you know, so remote code execution, if know, so remote code execution, if know, so remote code execution, if someone successfully compro leverages someone successfully compro leverages someone successfully compro leverages remote code execution, they've got shell remote code execution, they've got shell remote code execution, they've got shell on your system, that's really bad. It on your system, that's really bad. It on your system, that's really bad. It does nothing to say here's the does nothing to say here's the does nothing to say here's the likelihood of that happening likelihood of that happening likelihood of that happening or they could get that, but it's a low or they could get that, but it's a low or they could get that, but it's a low privilege user so you don't have much privilege user so you don't have much privilege user so you don't have much happening or you have these mitigating happening or you have these mitigating happening or you have these mitigating uh pieces in uh pieces in uh pieces in place. The CVSS specification tells the place. The CVSS specification tells the place. The CVSS specification tells the analyst assume the worst case scenario. analyst assume the worst case scenario. analyst assume the worst case scenario. So that's why you see a lot of memory So that's why you see a lot of memory So that's why you see a lot of memory corruptions, a lot of memor buffer corruptions, a lot of memor buffer corruptions, a lot of memor buffer overflows that in the real world might overflows that in the real world might overflows that in the real world might crash the system, get rated as a remote crash the system, get rated as a remote crash the system, get rated as a remote code execution vulnerability because in code execution vulnerability because in code execution vulnerability because in the worst case scenario, you might find the worst case scenario, you might find the worst case scenario, you might find a way to exploit that and get a uh uh a way to exploit that and get a uh uh a way to exploit that and get a uh uh code execution. I've seen countless CV code execution. I've seen countless CV code execution. I've seen countless CV descriptions where it says, you know, descriptions where it says, you know, descriptions where it says, you know, buffer overflow, this and this happens buffer overflow, this and this happens buffer overflow, this and this happens likely denial of service. In some cases, likely denial of service. In some cases, likely denial of service. In some cases, you could have code execution you could have code execution you could have code execution immediately takes that from a, you know, immediately takes that from a, you know, immediately takes that from a, you know, five or a seven up to a, you know, five or a seven up to a, you know, five or a seven up to a, you know, 998. Uh, and that's what drives a lot of 998. Uh, and that's what drives a lot of 998. Uh, and that's what drives a lot of this. this. this. Now, those numbers, this is all CVs Now, those numbers, this is all CVs Now, those numbers, this is all CVs published all the time. Uh, over 50% of published all the time. Uh, over 50% of published all the time. Uh, over 50% of CVs published in all time are a higher CVs published in all time are a higher CVs published in all time are a higher critical severity. Now, not everyone's critical severity. Now, not everyone's critical severity. Now, not everyone's got every CV in their environment, I got every CV in their environment, I got every CV in their environment, I hope. uh but you're gonna have a lot of hope. uh but you're gonna have a lot of hope. uh but you're gonna have a lot of highend criticals just by nature of uh highend criticals just by nature of uh highend criticals just by nature of uh what is out there. Um it is a huge lift what is out there. Um it is a huge lift what is out there. Um it is a huge lift to address every high-end critical to address every high-end critical to address every high-end critical vulnerability. I did some research. Uh vulnerability. I did some research. Uh vulnerability. I did some research. Uh most organizations have on average about most organizations have on average about most organizations have on average about 500 high-end critical vulnerabilities 500 high-end critical vulnerabilities 500 high-end critical vulnerabilities across their infrastructure. Uh and that across their infrastructure. Uh and that across their infrastructure. Uh and that can be the same thing on multiple. So can be the same thing on multiple. So can be the same thing on multiple. So that's just on any given day. There's that's just on any given day. There's that's just on any given day. There's just too much to fix. Um, like I said, just too much to fix. Um, like I said, just too much to fix. Um, like I said, some of this is tied to, you know, PCI some of this is tied to, you know, PCI some of this is tied to, you know, PCI ASV, you know, scanning. If you have PCI ASV, you know, scanning. If you have PCI ASV, you know, scanning. If you have PCI requirements, you have to remediate requirements, you have to remediate requirements, you have to remediate everything that is a four or higher. And everything that is a four or higher. And everything that is a four or higher. And that's four is down in the medium range that's four is down in the medium range that's four is down in the medium range within 3 months. Uh, high and critical, within 3 months. Uh, high and critical, within 3 months. Uh, high and critical, I believe, is 30 days, but that's for a I believe, is 30 days, but that's for a I believe, is 30 days, but that's for a very narrow case. Uh, so we're doing a very narrow case. Uh, so we're doing a very narrow case. Uh, so we're doing a lot of uh kind lot of uh kind lot of uh kind of um difficulty to ourselves by really of um difficulty to ourselves by really of um difficulty to ourselves by really tying ourselves to CBSS severity. tying ourselves to CBSS severity. tying ourselves to CBSS severity. Um, even if you're, like I said, even if Um, even if you're, like I said, even if Um, even if you're, like I said, even if you're remediating fast enough, you're you're remediating fast enough, you're you're remediating fast enough, you're going to have the another set the next going to have the another set the next going to have the another set the next morning to wake up and deal with. Now, morning to wake up and deal with. Now, morning to wake up and deal with. Now, there are some steps if you really are there are some steps if you really are there are some steps if you really are tied to CVSS that you can take to tied to CVSS that you can take to tied to CVSS that you can take to leverage it to its fullest. Uh, and leverage it to its fullest. Uh, and leverage it to its fullest. Uh, and that's uh, using the what happened here? There we go. um that's using the here? There we go. um that's using the here? There we go. um that's using the other components. So a lot of a lot of other components. So a lot of a lot of other components. So a lot of a lot of people use CBSS base. That's what we people use CBSS base. That's what we people use CBSS base. That's what we use. It's what MVD has. That's what uh use. It's what MVD has. That's what uh use. It's what MVD has. That's what uh everyone's stuck with. But there are everyone's stuck with. But there are everyone's stuck with. But there are other aspects of CBSS that you can use. other aspects of CBSS that you can use. other aspects of CBSS that you can use. There's the temporal metrics and before There's the temporal metrics and before There's the temporal metrics and before it's uh the threat metrics. Uh I'm it's uh the threat metrics. Uh I'm it's uh the threat metrics. Uh I'm actually really happy they dropped actually really happy they dropped actually really happy they dropped everything except the threat component everything except the threat component everything except the threat component of it. Uh and then the environmental of it. Uh and then the environmental of it. Uh and then the environmental metric, which is going to be very metric, which is going to be very metric, which is going to be very specific to your environment or very specific to your environment or very specific to your environment or very specific to your product. These metrics specific to your product. These metrics specific to your product. These metrics can help adjust that score downward. So can help adjust that score downward. So can help adjust that score downward. So if you if it's a remote credit execution if you if it's a remote credit execution if you if it's a remote credit execution but there's no uh exploits available, but there's no uh exploits available, but there's no uh exploits available, it'll bring the score down some. Uh if it'll bring the score down some. Uh if it'll bring the score down some. Uh if you know in your environment that this you know in your environment that this you know in your environment that this system is got no useful data, it's not system is got no useful data, it's not system is got no useful data, it's not important, it does nothing, you can use important, it does nothing, you can use important, it does nothing, you can use environmental metrics to adjust those uh environmental metrics to adjust those uh environmental metrics to adjust those uh impact uh metrics, bring the scores impact uh metrics, bring the scores impact uh metrics, bring the scores down. This is a good way to again start down. This is a good way to again start down. This is a good way to again start bringing some of that context, help bringing some of that context, help bringing some of that context, help manage those numbers if you're tying manage those numbers if you're tying manage those numbers if you're tying yourself to CBSS. So just to show kind yourself to CBSS. So just to show kind yourself to CBSS. So just to show kind of what this means looking at focus on of what this means looking at focus on of what this means looking at focus on CBS S3. Now I know V4 is the current CBS S3. Now I know V4 is the current CBS S3. Now I know V4 is the current standard but I've stuck to V3 because standard but I've stuck to V3 because standard but I've stuck to V3 because that's where most systems have data. A that's where most systems have data. A that's where most systems have data. A lot of vendors are still on V3 making lot of vendors are still on V3 making lot of vendors are still on V3 making the move to V4. So I'm focusing this on the move to V4. So I'm focusing this on the move to V4. So I'm focusing this on V4 uh or V4 uh or V4 uh or V3. Like I said uh the the numbers carry V3. Like I said uh the the numbers carry V3. Like I said uh the the numbers carry forward 2024 alone over almost 50% of forward 2024 alone over almost 50% of forward 2024 alone over almost 50% of the CVS had a CVSS severity of higher the CVS had a CVSS severity of higher the CVS had a CVSS severity of higher critical. Now if I apply just a temporal critical. Now if I apply just a temporal critical. Now if I apply just a temporal metric and uh set the uh the threat uh metric and uh set the uh the threat uh metric and uh set the uh the threat uh threat level to the appropriate level threat level to the appropriate level threat level to the appropriate level from not defined to either unproven from not defined to either unproven from not defined to either unproven proof of concept exploit available. I proof of concept exploit available. I proof of concept exploit available. I can see some adjustment. It's not huge can see some adjustment. It's not huge can see some adjustment. It's not huge though. We've still got you know not though. We've still got you know not though. We've still got you know not even a thousand less critical even a thousand less critical even a thousand less critical vulnerabilities. Decent drop on the vulnerabilities. Decent drop on the vulnerabilities. Decent drop on the highs. Uh we we lost about you know highs. Uh we we lost about you know highs. Uh we we lost about you know 4,000. a lot of things shifted to the 4,000. a lot of things shifted to the 4,000. a lot of things shifted to the mediums, but there's still a lot of high mediums, but there's still a lot of high mediums, but there's still a lot of high and critical vulnerabilities to uh and critical vulnerabilities to uh and critical vulnerabilities to uh remediate. Now, in my opinion, CBSS is remediate. Now, in my opinion, CBSS is remediate. Now, in my opinion, CBSS is not dropping the score enough when you not dropping the score enough when you not dropping the score enough when you bring in that threat metric. If bring in that threat metric. If bring in that threat metric. If something doesn't have a threat uh a something doesn't have a threat uh a something doesn't have a threat uh a known exploit, it's a much lower known exploit, it's a much lower known exploit, it's a much lower risk. Um but it is a way you can start risk. Um but it is a way you can start risk. Um but it is a way you can start to do that. Now, like I said, the to do that. Now, like I said, the to do that. Now, like I said, the temporal is just one piece. Uh the temporal is just one piece. Uh the temporal is just one piece. Uh the environmental metrics can help you environmental metrics can help you environmental metrics can help you manage this a little more. So I took a manage this a little more. So I took a manage this a little more. So I took a common example scenario. Lots of 98s out common example scenario. Lots of 98s out common example scenario. Lots of 98s out there. Code execution. You just don't there. Code execution. You just don't there. Code execution. You just don't have a change of have a change of have a change of scope. This is really common. The only scope. This is really common. The only scope. This is really common. The only thing that keeps it from being a 10 is thing that keeps it from being a 10 is thing that keeps it from being a 10 is a, you know, scope change and just means a, you know, scope change and just means a, you know, scope change and just means it's bad for your system, not it's bad for your system, not it's bad for your system, not necessarily another one. necessarily another one. necessarily another one. Um, you may look at this and say, okay, Um, you may look at this and say, okay, Um, you may look at this and say, okay, well, the systems that are affected well, the systems that are affected well, the systems that are affected aren't exposed to the internet. They're aren't exposed to the internet. They're aren't exposed to the internet. They're network adjacent uh exploit um attack network adjacent uh exploit um attack network adjacent uh exploit um attack vector, not network attack vector. You vector, not network attack vector. You vector, not network attack vector. You may also determine that the assets are may also determine that the assets are may also determine that the assets are not important. There's no sensitive not important. There's no sensitive not important. There's no sensitive data. There's no nothing important data. There's no nothing important data. There's no nothing important there. So, you can influence this down. there. So, you can influence this down. there. So, you can influence this down. And what that looks like is you go from And what that looks like is you go from And what that looks like is you go from a, you know, uh, temporal score goes a, you know, uh, temporal score goes a, you know, uh, temporal score goes from a 98 98 to a 93 if you say proof of from a 98 98 to a 93 if you say proof of from a 98 98 to a 93 if you say proof of concept. Uh, it only goes down to a 90 concept. Uh, it only goes down to a 90 concept. Uh, it only goes down to a 90 if you say unproven. Uh, so not a huge, if you say unproven. Uh, so not a huge, if you say unproven. Uh, so not a huge, but then you introduce the but then you introduce the but then you introduce the um the other environmental metrics. um the other environmental metrics. um the other environmental metrics. Suddenly you're from a 98 down to a six. Suddenly you're from a 98 down to a six. Suddenly you're from a 98 down to a six. You're at a medium. Okay, now you're You're at a medium. Okay, now you're You're at a medium. Okay, now you're outside the high-end critical. So, you outside the high-end critical. So, you outside the high-end critical. So, you can leverage that to help manage your can leverage that to help manage your can leverage that to help manage your numbers a little bit more. Focus on the numbers a little bit more. Focus on the numbers a little bit more. Focus on the high-end critical. Um, again, if you're high-end critical. Um, again, if you're high-end critical. Um, again, if you're tied to CVSS is important. Now, there's tied to CVSS is important. Now, there's tied to CVSS is important. Now, there's a risk with this. I've said that this a risk with this. I've said that this a risk with this. I've said that this system is not important. It doesn't have system is not important. It doesn't have system is not important. It doesn't have sensitive data on it or anything that sensitive data on it or anything that sensitive data on it or anything that ignores lateral movement. Saying it's ignores lateral movement. Saying it's ignores lateral movement. Saying it's not exposed to the internet ex ignores not exposed to the internet ex ignores not exposed to the internet ex ignores the fact that attackers will get in on the fact that attackers will get in on the fact that attackers will get in on the firewall and then they're inside the the firewall and then they're inside the the firewall and then they're inside the network. You're no longer protected by network. You're no longer protected by network. You're no longer protected by that barrier. So yes, you want to focus that barrier. So yes, you want to focus that barrier. So yes, you want to focus on the network exposing expose things on the network exposing expose things on the network exposing expose things first, but you can't pretend like no first, but you can't pretend like no first, but you can't pretend like no one's ever going to get to those assets. one's ever going to get to those assets. one's ever going to get to those assets. And just because it doesn't have And just because it doesn't have And just because it doesn't have sensitive data doesn't mean it's not sensitive data doesn't mean it's not sensitive data doesn't mean it's not useful. You have someone who has, you useful. You have someone who has, you useful. You have someone who has, you know, someone who on their laptop, they know, someone who on their laptop, they know, someone who on their laptop, they don't have any useful information, but don't have any useful information, but don't have any useful information, but they like to click on those pictures they like to click on those pictures they like to click on those pictures that they get in their email. Suddenly that they get in their email. Suddenly that they get in their email. Suddenly hackers in on the network and they can hackers in on the network and they can hackers in on the network and they can pivot from there. So we can't make those pivot from there. So we can't make those pivot from there. So we can't make those assumptions that environmental is going assumptions that environmental is going assumptions that environmental is going to uh help us too much. it can mask some to uh help us too much. it can mask some to uh help us too much. it can mask some of that risk if we're not of that risk if we're not of that risk if we're not careful. Um, so what's missing from careful. Um, so what's missing from careful. Um, so what's missing from this? You know, something I kind of like this? You know, something I kind of like this? You know, something I kind of like to say, vulnerability that's never to say, vulnerability that's never to say, vulnerability that's never exploited, it's a potential risk. If no exploited, it's a potential risk. If no exploited, it's a potential risk. If no one has an exploit, if no one ever one has an exploit, if no one ever one has an exploit, if no one ever exploits it, it might potentially be a exploits it, it might potentially be a exploits it, it might potentially be a risk one day, but without an exploit, risk one day, but without an exploit, risk one day, but without an exploit, it's just potential. Um, developing it's just potential. Um, developing it's just potential. Um, developing reliable exploits, even with AI, even reliable exploits, even with AI, even reliable exploits, even with AI, even with all the tooling out there, it's with all the tooling out there, it's with all the tooling out there, it's still hard. uh especially if you want to still hard. uh especially if you want to still hard. uh especially if you want to develop an exploit that can be used in develop an exploit that can be used in develop an exploit that can be used in the real world, repeated across it uh the real world, repeated across it uh the real world, repeated across it uh spaces. Keep in mind a lot of attackers spaces. Keep in mind a lot of attackers spaces. Keep in mind a lot of attackers are probably like uh developers. You've are probably like uh developers. You've are probably like uh developers. You've got to write code, you've got to reuse got to write code, you've got to reuse got to write code, you've got to reuse code because if you have to write it code because if you have to write it code because if you have to write it every time uh that's slow and every time uh that's slow and every time uh that's slow and expensive. Uh not all exploited expensive. Uh not all exploited expensive. Uh not all exploited vulnerabilities are high or critical. vulnerabilities are high or critical. vulnerabilities are high or critical. There are exploited vulnerabilities that There are exploited vulnerabilities that There are exploited vulnerabilities that are in the medium range. Uh now it's are in the medium range. Uh now it's are in the medium range. Uh now it's less frequent, but that becomes a pivot. less frequent, but that becomes a pivot. less frequent, but that becomes a pivot. So, but numbers So, but numbers So, but numbers um 54% of all CVEes with a CVSS severity um 54% of all CVEes with a CVSS severity um 54% of all CVEes with a CVSS severity of higher critical. We've covered that of higher critical. We've covered that of higher critical. We've covered that one. Uh 48% in 2024. Now, only 13% of one. Uh 48% in 2024. Now, only 13% of one. Uh 48% in 2024. Now, only 13% of the 2024 CBS had a published proof of the 2024 CBS had a published proof of the 2024 CBS had a published proof of concept code. So, again, I really focus concept code. So, again, I really focus concept code. So, again, I really focus on proof of concept on proof of concept on proof of concept because why people like to reuse code. because why people like to reuse code. because why people like to reuse code. If you don't have proof of concept, If you don't have proof of concept, If you don't have proof of concept, you've got to figure it out for you've got to figure it out for you've got to figure it out for yourself. Once the proof of concept is yourself. Once the proof of concept is yourself. Once the proof of concept is out there, especially if it's good, if out there, especially if it's good, if out there, especially if it's good, if it's, you know, functional, you can it's, you know, functional, you can it's, you know, functional, you can start to pick it up, tweak it, start to start to pick it up, tweak it, start to start to pick it up, tweak it, start to weaponize it. So proof of concept to me weaponize it. So proof of concept to me weaponize it. So proof of concept to me is sort of that first phase of is sort of that first phase of is sort of that first phase of introducing risk. This thing is going to introducing risk. This thing is going to introducing risk. This thing is going to become a little more dangerous. It's become a little more dangerous. It's become a little more dangerous. It's going to get a little more attention. going to get a little more attention. going to get a little more attention. Now, one of the things I, you know, Now, one of the things I, you know, Now, one of the things I, you know, think about is how many proof of think about is how many proof of think about is how many proof of concepts are out there. If there's one, concepts are out there. If there's one, concepts are out there. If there's one, okay, might not be very useful. If okay, might not be very useful. If okay, might not be very useful. If there's 50, there's a lot of attention there's 50, there's a lot of attention there's 50, there's a lot of attention on it. Uh but again only 13% had on it. Uh but again only 13% had on it. Uh but again only 13% had published proof of concept published proof of concept published proof of concept alone. Uh less than 1% of the 2024 CVS alone. Uh less than 1% of the 2024 CVS alone. Uh less than 1% of the 2024 CVS have known active exploitation. So have known active exploitation. So have known active exploitation. So that's out of the 38 to 40,000 that were that's out of the 38 to 40,000 that were that's out of the 38 to 40,000 that were published in 2024 less than 1% have published in 2024 less than 1% have published in 2024 less than 1% have active known active exploitation. Now active known active exploitation. Now active known active exploitation. Now let's assume that some of that active let's assume that some of that active let's assume that some of that active exploitation flies under the radar radar exploitation flies under the radar radar exploitation flies under the radar radar and it's not tracked. Even if it's two, and it's not tracked. Even if it's two, and it's not tracked. Even if it's two, three, 4%. That is tiny compared to the three, 4%. That is tiny compared to the three, 4%. That is tiny compared to the overall numbers and it becomes very overall numbers and it becomes very overall numbers and it becomes very manageable. Um, if you can really focus manageable. Um, if you can really focus manageable. Um, if you can really focus on those known active exploitations, you on those known active exploitations, you on those known active exploitations, you can start to have a difference. You can can start to have a difference. You can can start to have a difference. You can see your numbers going down because when see your numbers going down because when see your numbers going down because when those numbers are, you know, a couple those numbers are, you know, a couple those numbers are, you know, a couple hundred, maybe a thousand, it's not this hundred, maybe a thousand, it's not this hundred, maybe a thousand, it's not this constant sort of uh baseline. constant sort of uh baseline. constant sort of uh baseline. Now, question I like to think about is Now, question I like to think about is Now, question I like to think about is what do we focus on? Everyone kind of what do we focus on? Everyone kind of what do we focus on? Everyone kind of likes to think about these really likes to think about these really likes to think about these really sophisticated attackers, nation states sophisticated attackers, nation states sophisticated attackers, nation states that are the best at what they do. And that are the best at what they do. And that are the best at what they do. And yes, they are absolutely out there. And yes, they are absolutely out there. And yes, they are absolutely out there. And like I said, if they want in, they're like I said, if they want in, they're like I said, if they want in, they're probably going to find a way in. That's probably going to find a way in. That's probably going to find a way in. That's where you have the layers of defense. where you have the layers of defense. where you have the layers of defense. You've got configurations. You've got You've got configurations. You've got You've got configurations. You've got all sorts of tools to help prevent all sorts of tools to help prevent all sorts of tools to help prevent them. There's also the rest of the bad them. There's also the rest of the bad them. There's also the rest of the bad guys out there. They've got a keyboard guys out there. They've got a keyboard guys out there. They've got a keyboard and they can pull some code off the and they can pull some code off the and they can pull some code off the shelf and they can run it and point it shelf and they can run it and point it shelf and they can run it and point it at something. They are not developing at something. They are not developing at something. They are not developing these exploits. They are not. They're these exploits. They are not. They're these exploits. They are not. They're pulling stuff. It's like any of us pulling stuff. It's like any of us pulling stuff. It's like any of us pulling from a, you know, open source pulling from a, you know, open source pulling from a, you know, open source software and reusing it. If it's there, software and reusing it. If it's there, software and reusing it. If it's there, we're going to use it. If it's not we're going to use it. If it's not we're going to use it. If it's not there, we might not even there, we might not even there, we might not even bother. We put a lot of attention on the bother. We put a lot of attention on the bother. We put a lot of attention on the advanced thread actor trying to do advanced thread actor trying to do advanced thread actor trying to do everything possible to stop them and everything possible to stop them and everything possible to stop them and ignore sort of this left hand side of ignore sort of this left hand side of ignore sort of this left hand side of it. Now the reason it's important is if it. Now the reason it's important is if it. Now the reason it's important is if we can cut off those known exploits. If we can cut off those known exploits. If we can cut off those known exploits. If we cut off the systems that have known we cut off the systems that have known we cut off the systems that have known exploitation in them, you can cut off exploitation in them, you can cut off exploitation in them, you can cut off the left half. You can at least not be the left half. You can at least not be the left half. You can at least not be the, you know, uh, group that has, you the, you know, uh, group that has, you the, you know, uh, group that has, you know, makes the news because a know, makes the news because a know, makes the news because a 13-year-old popped your system with some 13-year-old popped your system with some 13-year-old popped your system with some code that he found on the internet. I code that he found on the internet. I code that he found on the internet. I want to avoid that. Um, a lot of want to avoid that. Um, a lot of want to avoid that. Um, a lot of ransomware as a service. They are ransomware as a service. They are ransomware as a service. They are reusing code over and over and over reusing code over and over and over reusing code over and over and over again. It is not novel code every single again. It is not novel code every single again. It is not novel code every single time they do this. So if you can cut time they do this. So if you can cut time they do this. So if you can cut those off, you start to cut off those uh those off, you start to cut off those uh those off, you start to cut off those uh access vectors. Again, we're not going access vectors. Again, we're not going access vectors. Again, we're not going to stop everyone with that. Uh but we to stop everyone with that. Uh but we to stop everyone with that. Uh but we can take steps to focus on the things can take steps to focus on the things can take steps to focus on the things that are most that are most that are most dangerous. So moving forward a little dangerous. So moving forward a little dangerous. So moving forward a little bit, how do we take this kind of to the bit, how do we take this kind of to the bit, how do we take this kind of to the next level? Uh I was really happy to see next level? Uh I was really happy to see next level? Uh I was really happy to see when EPSS came out. Every security when EPSS came out. Every security when EPSS came out. Every security company out there had we've got company out there had we've got company out there had we've got different scoring mechanisms, machine different scoring mechanisms, machine different scoring mechanisms, machine learning, all of this. EPSS came out. learning, all of this. EPSS came out. learning, all of this. EPSS came out. One of the advantages of it is it's not One of the advantages of it is it's not One of the advantages of it is it's not tied to any one company. Uh it's sort of tied to any one company. Uh it's sort of tied to any one company. Uh it's sort of a you know vendor neutral I'd say. It's a you know vendor neutral I'd say. It's a you know vendor neutral I'd say. It's a not quite an industry standard yet but a not quite an industry standard yet but a not quite an industry standard yet but uh it has the ability to uh move in that uh it has the ability to uh move in that uh it has the ability to uh move in that direction. The idea of EPSS is to show direction. The idea of EPSS is to show direction. The idea of EPSS is to show the likelihood of vulnerability being the likelihood of vulnerability being the likelihood of vulnerability being exploited in the next 28 days. Again exploited in the next 28 days. Again exploited in the next 28 days. Again this becomes useful because without an this becomes useful because without an this becomes useful because without an exploit it's less dangerous. It's exploit it's less dangerous. It's exploit it's less dangerous. It's potentially dangerous one day but not potentially dangerous one day but not potentially dangerous one day but not right there yet. right there yet. right there yet. So in So in So in theory, if the algorithm is right, we theory, if the algorithm is right, we theory, if the algorithm is right, we should be focusing on the most dangerous should be focusing on the most dangerous should be focusing on the most dangerous vulnerabilities, the ones that are going vulnerabilities, the ones that are going vulnerabilities, the ones that are going to get exploited, the ones we know are to get exploited, the ones we know are to get exploited, the ones we know are going to get going to get going to get exploited. That's great because if we exploited. That's great because if we exploited. That's great because if we can patch those, if we can take those can patch those, if we can take those can patch those, if we can take those out of our environment, we're at a lower out of our environment, we're at a lower out of our environment, we're at a lower risk. Because it's a numeric numeric risk. Because it's a numeric numeric risk. Because it's a numeric numeric value, it's really easy to sort and value, it's really easy to sort and value, it's really easy to sort and organize. Like I said, CBSS is nice. organize. Like I said, CBSS is nice. organize. Like I said, CBSS is nice. It's a number you can put in a It's a number you can put in a It's a number you can put in a spreadsheet, sort, filter, do all of spreadsheet, sort, filter, do all of spreadsheet, sort, filter, do all of that. But we have to ask ourselves how that. But we have to ask ourselves how that. But we have to ask ourselves how it's it's it's performing. It's a distribution of the performing. It's a distribution of the performing. It's a distribution of the EPSS scores. You see a whole lot of EPSS scores. You see a whole lot of EPSS scores. You see a whole lot of them. It's a probability between zero them. It's a probability between zero them. It's a probability between zero and one. Whole lot of them on the left and one. Whole lot of them on the left and one. Whole lot of them on the left side. It's good because most CVS, like I side. It's good because most CVS, like I side. It's good because most CVS, like I said, most CVS are not exploited. So, we said, most CVS are not exploited. So, we said, most CVS are not exploited. So, we want to see a lot of the CVS over on the want to see a lot of the CVS over on the want to see a lot of the CVS over on the left hand side. More majority of them left hand side. More majority of them left hand side. More majority of them have an EPSS score of less than 0.1. have an EPSS score of less than 0.1. have an EPSS score of less than 0.1. If we take a conservative approach and If we take a conservative approach and If we take a conservative approach and say an ECB with an EPSS of.3 or say an ECB with an EPSS of.3 or say an ECB with an EPSS of.3 or higher should be remediated in 30 days, higher should be remediated in 30 days, higher should be remediated in 30 days, that's only 3% of all that's only 3% of all that's only 3% of all CBES. Uh if we go even narrower and say CBES. Uh if we go even narrower and say CBES. Uh if we go even narrower and say look, I want to focus on just the uh look, I want to focus on just the uh look, I want to focus on just the uh EPSS scores of 0.9 or higher, it's only EPSS scores of 0.9 or higher, it's only EPSS scores of 0.9 or higher, it's only 2554. Uh so it's really promising. You 2554. Uh so it's really promising. You 2554. Uh so it's really promising. You can you've got manageable numbers you can you've got manageable numbers you can you've got manageable numbers you can really start to focus on. You can can really start to focus on. You can can really start to focus on. You can really pick out really pick out really pick out These are the things that are important These are the things that are important These are the things that are important and you can show progress. You're not and you can show progress. You're not and you can show progress. You're not having 5,000 CVs added constantly. having 5,000 CVs added constantly. having 5,000 CVs added constantly. There's going to be a small number that There's going to be a small number that There's going to be a small number that make it to that top tier. Um, but that's just surface level. tier. Um, but that's just surface level. tier. Um, but that's just surface level. That's looking at the distribution. That's looking at the distribution. That's looking at the distribution. That's assuming yes, we're super happy That's assuming yes, we're super happy That's assuming yes, we're super happy with it. We want to look and dig in a with it. We want to look and dig in a with it. We want to look and dig in a little more and understand, is this little more and understand, is this little more and understand, is this telling us what we really need to know? telling us what we really need to know? telling us what we really need to know? Are we confident in the data? Are we Are we confident in the data? Are we Are we confident in the data? Are we going to miss things that are actually going to miss things that are actually going to miss things that are actually dangerous? dangerous? dangerous? uh 80% of the CVS with an EPSS greater uh 80% of the CVS with an EPSS greater uh 80% of the CVS with an EPSS greater than 0.9 which me you know 0.9 that's than 0.9 which me you know 0.9 that's than 0.9 which me you know 0.9 that's pretty which I mean that's pretty high pretty which I mean that's pretty high pretty which I mean that's pretty high uh no known exploitation at all. So uh no known exploitation at all. So uh no known exploitation at all. So again with no known exploitation it again with no known exploitation it again with no known exploitation it doesn't mean it's not going to be doesn't mean it's not going to be doesn't mean it's not going to be exploited but that is a very strong exploited but that is a very strong exploited but that is a very strong indicator of risk. 80% of the CV is at indicator of risk. 80% of the CV is at indicator of risk. 80% of the CV is at that upper range without it starts to that upper range without it starts to that upper range without it starts to send a signal you might be chasing send a signal you might be chasing send a signal you might be chasing things that are not important not a things that are not important not a things that are not important not a guarantee uh guarantee uh guarantee uh but 25% of CBS with an EPSS greater than but 25% of CBS with an EPSS greater than but 25% of CBS with an EPSS greater than 0.9 no known proof of concept. So they 0.9 no known proof of concept. So they 0.9 no known proof of concept. So they have no proof of concept no known have no proof of concept no known have no proof of concept no known exploitation. So again, this starts to exploitation. So again, this starts to exploitation. So again, this starts to call in the question, are you going to call in the question, are you going to call in the question, are you going to chase things that are not actually at chase things that are not actually at chase things that are not actually at risk at at the time? Uh they may become risk at at the time? Uh they may become risk at at the time? Uh they may become one day. Um now on the other end, the one day. Um now on the other end, the one day. Um now on the other end, the part that I was really, you know, wanted part that I was really, you know, wanted part that I was really, you know, wanted to focus on is are you going to miss to focus on is are you going to miss to focus on is are you going to miss things that are dangerous? Are you going things that are dangerous? Are you going things that are dangerous? Are you going to miss things that are problematic? 50% to miss things that are problematic? 50% to miss things that are problematic? 50% of CVS have no known exploitation and an of CVS have no known exploitation and an of CVS have no known exploitation and an EPSS is less than 0.1. Now again, it's EPSS is less than 0.1. Now again, it's EPSS is less than 0.1. Now again, it's probability. This doesn't mean that probability. This doesn't mean that probability. This doesn't mean that these are not going to be exploited. But these are not going to be exploited. But these are not going to be exploited. But if I wanted to sort and filter and most if I wanted to sort and filter and most if I wanted to sort and filter and most of the things are on that bottom end, of the things are on that bottom end, of the things are on that bottom end, I'm going to focus on the other end. I'm going to focus on the other end. I'm going to focus on the other end. Well, 50% of the CVS with known Well, 50% of the CVS with known Well, 50% of the CVS with known exploitation are hiding in that bottom exploitation are hiding in that bottom exploitation are hiding in that bottom end. Now, I got to sift through 150, end. Now, I got to sift through 150, end. Now, I got to sift through 150, 200,000 CVS to find the right 200,000 CVS to find the right 200,000 CVS to find the right ones. That's concerning because you ones. That's concerning because you ones. That's concerning because you could be missing the vulnerabilities could be missing the vulnerabilities could be missing the vulnerabilities that are going to present you a most that are going to present you a most that are going to present you a most risk because you're not looking on the risk because you're not looking on the risk because you're not looking on the low end. Uh, and we don't want to look low end. Uh, and we don't want to look low end. Uh, and we don't want to look on the low end. There's a lot of CVS in on the low end. There's a lot of CVS in on the low end. There's a lot of CVS in there. there. there. uh 72,000 CVS have public proof of uh 72,000 CVS have public proof of uh 72,000 CVS have public proof of concept code and an EPSS of less than concept code and an EPSS of less than concept code and an EPSS of less than 0.2. Again, proof of concept code is a 0.2. Again, proof of concept code is a 0.2. Again, proof of concept code is a very it's a first step towards seeing very it's a first step towards seeing very it's a first step towards seeing active exploitation uh with the active exploitation uh with the active exploitation uh with the exclusion of zero days. Um that proof of exclusion of zero days. Um that proof of exclusion of zero days. Um that proof of concept code is going to get picked up. concept code is going to get picked up. concept code is going to get picked up. It's going to get reused. So if it's It's going to get reused. So if it's It's going to get reused. So if it's there, that presents a risk. Again, it's there, that presents a risk. Again, it's there, that presents a risk. Again, it's not a guarantee that's going to get not a guarantee that's going to get not a guarantee that's going to get exploited. see lots of uh exploited. see lots of uh exploited. see lots of uh vulnerabilities that go proof of concept vulnerabilities that go proof of concept vulnerabilities that go proof of concept never really get picked up. But this never really get picked up. But this never really get picked up. But this does raise some concerns that there are does raise some concerns that there are does raise some concerns that there are going to be dangerous vulnerabilities going to be dangerous vulnerabilities going to be dangerous vulnerabilities hiding on the lower hiding on the lower hiding on the lower ends. Now let's just kind of tell ends. Now let's just kind of tell ends. Now let's just kind of tell overall one of the limits you know is a overall one of the limits you know is a overall one of the limits you know is a strength but it's also a limit. EPSS is strength but it's also a limit. EPSS is strength but it's also a limit. EPSS is just a just a just a number. When you're making decisions on number. When you're making decisions on number. When you're making decisions on a number you're placing all your trust a number you're placing all your trust a number you're placing all your trust in the scoring algorithm. Now CVSS you in the scoring algorithm. Now CVSS you in the scoring algorithm. Now CVSS you have an advantage. You know what the have an advantage. You know what the have an advantage. You know what the algorithm is, you can run your own algorithm is, you can run your own algorithm is, you can run your own numbers, you can make some tweaks, you numbers, you can make some tweaks, you numbers, you can make some tweaks, you can do adjustments. Machine learning can do adjustments. Machine learning can do adjustments. Machine learning algorithms, and this is true algorithms, and this is true algorithms, and this is true universally, are black boxes. Bunch of universally, are black boxes. Bunch of universally, are black boxes. Bunch of data goes in, number comes out. So you data goes in, number comes out. So you data goes in, number comes out. So you have to trust that that black box is have to trust that that black box is have to trust that that black box is giving you the right numbers. With no giving you the right numbers. With no giving you the right numbers. With no data to support the numbers, you're data to support the numbers, you're data to support the numbers, you're putting all of your trust in that number putting all of your trust in that number putting all of your trust in that number alone. And if you don't evaluate the uh alone. And if you don't evaluate the uh alone. And if you don't evaluate the uh performance of that performance of that performance of that model, you're basically guessing. you're model, you're basically guessing. you're model, you're basically guessing. you're hoping it works. Uh it's useful. It hoping it works. Uh it's useful. It hoping it works. Uh it's useful. It looks good. Uh but you're taking a looks good. Uh but you're taking a looks good. Uh but you're taking a chance. So numbers alone can't help uh chance. So numbers alone can't help uh chance. So numbers alone can't help uh can't kind of give us a day. Now if we can't kind of give us a day. Now if we can't kind of give us a day. Now if we start to see some context added to the start to see some context added to the start to see some context added to the data, that can make a big difference. data, that can make a big difference. data, that can make a big difference. You can start to say, okay, EPSS is You can start to say, okay, EPSS is You can start to say, okay, EPSS is here, but I see these things. So maybe here, but I see these things. So maybe here, but I see these things. So maybe they're in conflict with each other. I'm they're in conflict with each other. I'm they're in conflict with each other. I'm going to go dig on going to go dig on going to go dig on it. Uh it is my, you know, seeing the it. Uh it is my, you know, seeing the it. Uh it is my, you know, seeing the forest through the trees. What are we forest through the trees. What are we forest through the trees. What are we gonna do? How do we take, you know, gonna do? How do we take, you know, gonna do? How do we take, you know, solve the big picture? Um, so folks, solve the big picture? Um, so folks, solve the big picture? Um, so folks, area one, like I said, there's tactical area one, like I said, there's tactical area one, like I said, there's tactical response and there's uh long-term response and there's uh long-term response and there's uh long-term strategy. When you're building a strategy. When you're building a strategy. When you're building a strategy for your vulnerability strategy for your vulnerability strategy for your vulnerability management program, number one thing is management program, number one thing is management program, number one thing is it has to be defensible. You have to be it has to be defensible. You have to be it has to be defensible. You have to be able to explain to someone, I'm doing able to explain to someone, I'm doing able to explain to someone, I'm doing this because whether it's I'm doing this this because whether it's I'm doing this this because whether it's I'm doing this because PCI tells me or I'm doing this because PCI tells me or I'm doing this because PCI tells me or I'm doing this because CPS is there, you need to be because CPS is there, you need to be because CPS is there, you need to be able to stand behind able to stand behind able to stand behind it. Now, they may be pushed for one it. Now, they may be pushed for one it. Now, they may be pushed for one reason or another for compliance. So reason or another for compliance. So reason or another for compliance. So that might always be in the background. that might always be in the background. that might always be in the background. We will always, you know, we're always We will always, you know, we're always We will always, you know, we're always going to cover Microsoft vulnerabilities going to cover Microsoft vulnerabilities going to cover Microsoft vulnerabilities and Oracle vulnerabilities because and Oracle vulnerabilities because and Oracle vulnerabilities because everyone's going to ask for everyone's going to ask for everyone's going to ask for them. So you set your SLAs, you set your them. So you set your SLAs, you set your them. So you set your SLAs, you set your programs around that. That's going to be programs around that. That's going to be programs around that. That's going to be there. That's your day-to-day. You're there. That's your day-to-day. You're there. That's your day-to-day. You're just going to deal with just going to deal with just going to deal with it. Within that, you want to identify it. Within that, you want to identify it. Within that, you want to identify true risk. You want to make sure you're true risk. You want to make sure you're true risk. You want to make sure you're not, you know, your program is going to not, you know, your program is going to not, you know, your program is going to focus on true risk. You want to have focus on true risk. You want to have focus on true risk. You want to have defensible, measurable approaches for defensible, measurable approaches for defensible, measurable approaches for reducing risk. You don't want to go reducing risk. You don't want to go reducing risk. You don't want to go print your report on how you're doing print your report on how you're doing print your report on how you're doing and it's just a flatline. Every time you and it's just a flatline. Every time you and it's just a flatline. Every time you give your report to, you know, higher give your report to, you know, higher give your report to, you know, higher up, say, "Well, we're not going up, but up, say, "Well, we're not going up, but up, say, "Well, we're not going up, but we're not going down." You know, we're we're not going down." You know, we're we're not going down." You know, we're doing okay. You want to be able to say, doing okay. You want to be able to say, doing okay. You want to be able to say, "We're reducing risk." Remediating high "We're reducing risk." Remediating high "We're reducing risk." Remediating high and critical vulnerabilities does not and critical vulnerabilities does not and critical vulnerabilities does not guarantee you're reducing risk. You guarantee you're reducing risk. You guarantee you're reducing risk. You might remediate the ones that are not exploited. So, what can you focus on? exploited. So, what can you focus on? exploited. So, what can you focus on? How do you show that you're reducing How do you show that you're reducing How do you show that you're reducing risk? risk? risk? Um, siskev has about 1300 CVS. Uh, uh, Um, siskev has about 1300 CVS. Uh, uh, Um, siskev has about 1300 CVS. Uh, uh, we track, uh, collection more. So, we we track, uh, collection more. So, we we track, uh, collection more. So, we have about 1,500 uh 49 CBS with known have about 1,500 uh 49 CBS with known have about 1,500 uh 49 CBS with known exploitation. That's a small number. exploitation. That's a small number. exploitation. That's a small number. That's not 283,000. Uh, if you can focus That's not 283,000. Uh, if you can focus That's not 283,000. Uh, if you can focus on on on those a, you're meeting the those a, you're meeting the those a, you're meeting the vulnerabilities that are being vulnerabilities that are being vulnerabilities that are being exploited. So, there is a clear exploited. So, there is a clear exploited. So, there is a clear defensible explanation of I'm reducing defensible explanation of I'm reducing defensible explanation of I'm reducing risk. These are being exploited. I'm risk. These are being exploited. I'm risk. These are being exploited. I'm removing them from my environment. removing them from my environment. removing them from my environment. Therefore, they can't be Therefore, they can't be Therefore, they can't be exploited. Um, and that number is small. exploited. Um, and that number is small. exploited. Um, and that number is small. It's not going to you you're going to be It's not going to you you're going to be It's not going to you you're going to be able to go down and then you'll have able to go down and then you'll have able to go down and then you'll have little blips at the bottom. When little blips at the bottom. When little blips at the bottom. When something new comes out, you patch it, something new comes out, you patch it, something new comes out, you patch it, it's out. But you have good numbers to it's out. But you have good numbers to it's out. But you have good numbers to show. If you stick to an a sort of show. If you stick to an a sort of show. If you stick to an a sort of neutral source, 1300 in assist, uh, they neutral source, 1300 in assist, uh, they neutral source, 1300 in assist, uh, they have a kind of specific focus. So, have a kind of specific focus. So, have a kind of specific focus. So, there's things that won't show up there, there's things that won't show up there, there's things that won't show up there, uh, just data and uh, just data and uh, just data and everything. But again, it's defensible. everything. But again, it's defensible. everything. But again, it's defensible. CISA is a trusted source. They are CISA is a trusted source. They are CISA is a trusted source. They are telling us these are known exploited telling us these are known exploited telling us these are known exploited vulnerabilities. So if you can remediate vulnerabilities. So if you can remediate vulnerabilities. So if you can remediate those, you're going to make progress. those, you're going to make progress. those, you're going to make progress. You're going to demonstrate a reduction You're going to demonstrate a reduction You're going to demonstrate a reduction in risk. So when someone says, "Why are in risk. So when someone says, "Why are in risk. So when someone says, "Why are you doing it this way?" We're reducing you doing it this way?" We're reducing you doing it this way?" We're reducing risk. Uh we track 381 CVs associated risk. Uh we track 381 CVs associated risk. Uh we track 381 CVs associated with ransomware. I probably goes without with ransomware. I probably goes without with ransomware. I probably goes without saying, but no one wants to get hit by saying, but no one wants to get hit by saying, but no one wants to get hit by ransomware. Uh now I know vulner CVS are ransomware. Uh now I know vulner CVS are ransomware. Uh now I know vulner CVS are not the only way that attackers are not the only way that attackers are not the only way that attackers are getting in through ransomware, but it is getting in through ransomware, but it is getting in through ransomware, but it is a vector. So if you can remove that, a vector. So if you can remove that, a vector. So if you can remove that, you're at least removing that vector of you're at least removing that vector of you're at least removing that vector of attack. Um, so we put a lot of, you attack. Um, so we put a lot of, you attack. Um, so we put a lot of, you know, we try to call attention to those know, we try to call attention to those know, we try to call attention to those because if you can remove those because if you can remove those because if you can remove those vulnerabilities, you can remove a chunk vulnerabilities, you can remove a chunk vulnerabilities, you can remove a chunk of your ransomware of your ransomware of your ransomware risk. Again, it's not a huge number. risk. Again, it's not a huge number. risk. Again, it's not a huge number. It's a manageable number. Now, this is a It's a manageable number. Now, this is a It's a manageable number. Now, this is a bucket I like to look at what we kind of bucket I like to look at what we kind of bucket I like to look at what we kind of track as persistently exploited track as persistently exploited track as persistently exploited vulnerabilities. These are CVS that for vulnerabilities. These are CVS that for vulnerabilities. These are CVS that for some reason they just stick around. some reason they just stick around. some reason they just stick around. There's still CVS from 2017 that are There's still CVS from 2017 that are There's still CVS from 2017 that are leveraged in attacks. Why those are leveraged in attacks. Why those are leveraged in attacks. Why those are still around, I don't know. Uh, but still around, I don't know. Uh, but still around, I don't know. Uh, but these are the sorts of vulnerabilities these are the sorts of vulnerabilities these are the sorts of vulnerabilities that if you've got these, you should get that if you've got these, you should get that if you've got these, you should get rid of them. Means they've been around rid of them. Means they've been around rid of them. Means they've been around for a while. Probably they are for a while. Probably they are for a while. Probably they are attractive targets. They're probably attractive targets. They're probably attractive targets. They're probably super reliable. They're very easy. super reliable. They're very easy. super reliable. They're very easy. There's lots of tooling. You want to get There's lots of tooling. You want to get There's lots of tooling. You want to get rid of these. These are very easy uh for rid of these. These are very easy uh for rid of these. These are very easy uh for attackers to go attackers to go attackers to go after. And another bucket we focus on is after. And another bucket we focus on is after. And another bucket we focus on is the recently exploited. Things come and the recently exploited. Things come and the recently exploited. Things come and go. It's the internet. Nothing go. It's the internet. Nothing go. It's the internet. Nothing disappears. But what are the disappears. But what are the disappears. But what are the vulnerabilities that we see the most vulnerabilities that we see the most vulnerabilities that we see the most activity on from the uh attackers? What activity on from the uh attackers? What activity on from the uh attackers? What are the vulnerabilities that you might are the vulnerabilities that you might are the vulnerabilities that you might get hit opportunistically just because get hit opportunistically just because get hit opportunistically just because that's what's being scanned for? So that's what's being scanned for? So that's what's being scanned for? So right now, now this number changes. right now, now this number changes. right now, now this number changes. It's, you know, probably different from It's, you know, probably different from It's, you know, probably different from when I put this together a week ago, but when I put this together a week ago, but when I put this together a week ago, but at the time 26 recently exploited CVS. at the time 26 recently exploited CVS. at the time 26 recently exploited CVS. These are CVs that we see mention of in These are CVs that we see mention of in These are CVs that we see mention of in the news. We see activity uh uh from the news. We see activity uh uh from the news. We see activity uh uh from scanning services. It's not a huge scanning services. It's not a huge scanning services. It's not a huge number. Very manageable. Now maybe you know talking about this Now maybe you know talking about this Now maybe you know talking about this maybe everyone's doing this. I've maybe everyone's doing this. I've maybe everyone's doing this. I've checked see about hundred cysv checked see about hundred cysv checked see about hundred cysv vulnerabilities in customer environments vulnerabilities in customer environments vulnerabilities in customer environments at any given time. They're out there. at any given time. They're out there. at any given time. They're out there. These are not getting remediated the way These are not getting remediated the way These are not getting remediated the way I would uh hope they are. So I think the I would uh hope they are. So I think the I would uh hope they are. So I think the sysv has delivered on a promise. It sysv has delivered on a promise. It sysv has delivered on a promise. It gives people something to anchor to but gives people something to anchor to but gives people something to anchor to but we really need to put attention to that we really need to put attention to that we really need to put attention to that or whatever else you want to pick to or whatever else you want to pick to or whatever else you want to pick to help uh reduce your risk. help uh reduce your risk. help uh reduce your risk. Now another piece of this again this Now another piece of this again this Now another piece of this again this kind of comes back to the CVS temporal kind of comes back to the CVS temporal kind of comes back to the CVS temporal uh not tied specific to the assets but uh not tied specific to the assets but uh not tied specific to the assets but know which assets are externally facing know which assets are externally facing know which assets are externally facing see a lot of attention in the last year see a lot of attention in the last year see a lot of attention in the last year year and a half of uh attackers year and a half of uh attackers year and a half of uh attackers leveraging um network devices VPNs leveraging um network devices VPNs leveraging um network devices VPNs firewalls that are externally facing firewalls that are externally facing firewalls that are externally facing with a management interface on the with a management interface on the with a management interface on the internet. I know it's nice to be able to internet. I know it's nice to be able to internet. I know it's nice to be able to access a management interface from home, access a management interface from home, access a management interface from home, but we seem to not be able to secure but we seem to not be able to secure but we seem to not be able to secure them and they are an easy access factor. them and they are an easy access factor. them and they are an easy access factor. If you remove that, you're removing some If you remove that, you're removing some If you remove that, you're removing some of your risk. If it's externally facing, of your risk. If it's externally facing, of your risk. If it's externally facing, you want to at least attack those first you want to at least attack those first you want to at least attack those first because because because uh externally facing vulnerabilities uh externally facing vulnerabilities uh externally facing vulnerabilities that are code execution, zero click, that are code execution, zero click, that are code execution, zero click, those are going to get hit really fast. those are going to get hit really fast. those are going to get hit really fast. So, if you can patch those fast, uh So, if you can patch those fast, uh So, if you can patch those fast, uh that's ideal. Which assets are internal that's ideal. Which assets are internal that's ideal. Which assets are internal and remotely expert uh exploitable? Like and remotely expert uh exploitable? Like and remotely expert uh exploitable?

I think there were like 70,000 actual, I think there were like 70,000 actual, I think there were like 70,000 actual, you know, uh internet exposed instances you know, uh internet exposed instances you know, uh internet exposed instances of this. Ease of of this. Ease of of this. Ease of exploitation, network accessible, should exploitation, network accessible, should exploitation, network accessible, should not be exposed to the internet. some of not be exposed to the internet. some of not be exposed to the internet. some of them were uh but the the really key them were uh but the the really key them were uh but the the really key piece is you know it wasn't vulnerable piece is you know it wasn't vulnerable piece is you know it wasn't vulnerable in a default configuration in a default configuration in a default configuration um the initial exploit was trivial but um the initial exploit was trivial but um the initial exploit was trivial but the actual like chain to really leverage the actual like chain to really leverage the actual like chain to really leverage this you had I think it was three or this you had I think it was three or this you had I think it was three or four CVS that you had to chain together four CVS that you had to chain together four CVS that you had to chain together at some point in there you had to get at some point in there you had to get at some point in there you had to get someone to install a malicious printer someone to install a malicious printer someone to install a malicious printer that you created that had there were that you created that had there were that you created that had there were actually a lot of steps to have a actually a lot of steps to have a actually a lot of steps to have a successful attack uh successful attack uh successful attack uh and it's not something you should have and it's not something you should have and it's not something you should have so a lot of the remediation was just go so a lot of the remediation was just go so a lot of the remediation was just go turn it off stop using it or change this turn it off stop using it or change this turn it off stop using it or change this configuration So ease of remediation was configuration So ease of remediation was configuration So ease of remediation was another piece of okay this is going to another piece of okay this is going to another piece of okay this is going to hopefully disappear fairly quickly. hopefully disappear fairly quickly. hopefully disappear fairly quickly. There was a proof of concept but it was There was a proof of concept but it was There was a proof of concept but it was more of a it's a descriptive proof of more of a it's a descriptive proof of more of a it's a descriptive proof of concept. It wasn't something that could concept. It wasn't something that could concept. It wasn't something that could be weaponized easily. No known be weaponized easily. No known be weaponized easily. No known exploitation in the wild. So it's one of exploitation in the wild. So it's one of exploitation in the wild. So it's one of these ones there was a ton of noise. We these ones there was a ton of noise. We these ones there was a ton of noise. We had discussion turned out to not be so had discussion turned out to not be so had discussion turned out to not be so much uh CB vulnerability and Ivante secure uh CB vulnerability and Ivante secure uh CB vulnerability and Ivante secure connect. Now again different level connect. Now again different level connect. Now again different level product but evidence of zero day product but evidence of zero day product but evidence of zero day exploitation in the wild remote code exploitation in the wild remote code exploitation in the wild remote code execution could be paired with a by execution could be paired with a by execution could be paired with a by authentication bypass. So suddenly authentication bypass. So suddenly authentication bypass. So suddenly authentication requirement goes authentication requirement goes authentication requirement goes away broad scope is a popular VPN access away broad scope is a popular VPN access away broad scope is a popular VPN access uh uh uh tool VPN is internetf facing by design tool VPN is internetf facing by design tool VPN is internetf facing by design that's why we have VPNs. So that means that's why we have VPNs. So that means that's why we have VPNs. So that means anyone can just go up and hit it. Uh anyone can just go up and hit it. Uh anyone can just go up and hit it. Uh edge edge edge products are easily edge edge edge products are easily edge edge edge products are easily accessible. accessible. accessible. um ease of um ease of um ease of attack fairly trivial. Um and once you attack fairly trivial. Um and once you attack fairly trivial. Um and once you have that access to that system, your have that access to that system, your have that access to that system, your VPNs are trusted services. So once VPNs are trusted services. So once VPNs are trusted services. So once you're on there, you have you're in a you're on there, you have you're in a you're on there, you have you're in a trusted point where you can pivot your trusted point where you can pivot your trusted point where you can pivot your attack uh further and further.

Uh there was available proof of concept pretty was available proof of concept pretty was available proof of concept pretty quickly. Um and exploitation wild it was quickly. Um and exploitation wild it was quickly. Um and exploitation wild it was identified pre-disclosure. So this was identified pre-disclosure. So this was identified pre-disclosure. So this was an easy one for us like this is bad. an easy one for us like this is bad. an easy one for us like this is bad. We're going to get people moving. We're We're going to get people moving. We're We're going to get people moving. We're going to do what we can to cover it. uh going to do what we can to cover it. uh going to do what we can to cover it. uh and it was thankful very timely for this and it was thankful very timely for this and it was thankful very timely for this presentation and another fun one that I presentation and another fun one that I presentation and another fun one that I got a lot of people asking me about got a lot of people asking me about got a lot of people asking me about there's a CV uh in Apache parquet I the there's a CV uh in Apache parquet I the there's a CV uh in Apache parquet I the headlines were lots of fun max severity headlines were lots of fun max severity headlines were lots of fun max severity RC flaw discovered in widely apache RC flaw discovered in widely apache RC flaw discovered in widely apache parquet severe threat big data parquet severe threat big data parquet severe threat big data environment CVSS4 was 10.0 environment CVSS4 was 10.0 environment CVSS4 was 10.0 no proof of concept available. Like a no proof of concept available. Like a no proof of concept available. Like a lot of people saying, "Okay, this sounds lot of people saying, "Okay, this sounds lot of people saying, "Okay, this sounds bad. What are we doing? Like this is bad. What are we doing? Like this is bad. What are we doing? Like this is going to be bad." Well, first off, you going to be bad." Well, first off, you going to be bad." Well, first off, you shouldn't be loading malicious paret shouldn't be loading malicious paret shouldn't be loading malicious paret file. Like you shouldn't be loading file. Like you shouldn't be loading file. Like you shouldn't be loading untrusted parket file. So if you're untrusted parket file. So if you're untrusted parket file. So if you're doing that, you might want to have some doing that, you might want to have some doing that, you might want to have some discussions internally about how you're discussions internally about how you're discussions internally about how you're handling handling handling those successful track like a successful those successful track like a successful those successful track like a successful attack required tricking user into uh attack required tricking user into uh attack required tricking user into uh reading in the malicious paret files reading in the malicious paret files reading in the malicious paret files having it exposed. Like the actual path having it exposed. Like the actual path having it exposed. Like the actual path to exploiting this was bad. So this is to exploiting this was bad. So this is to exploiting this was bad. So this is like the impact of this vulnerability is like the impact of this vulnerability is like the impact of this vulnerability is bad. You remote code execution 10.0 it's bad. You remote code execution 10.0 it's bad. You remote code execution 10.0 it's bad but the likelihood of this being bad but the likelihood of this being bad but the likelihood of this being picked up and leveraged is not so bad. picked up and leveraged is not so bad. picked up and leveraged is not so bad. I've watched a last couple days still no I've watched a last couple days still no I've watched a last couple days still no evidence that I've seen of exploitation. evidence that I've seen of exploitation. evidence that I've seen of exploitation. No more proof of concepts posted. So No more proof of concepts posted. So No more proof of concepts posted. So this one will probably fizzle out like a this one will probably fizzle out like a this one will probably fizzle out like a lot of the other ones. Yeah. It's an lot of the other ones. Yeah. It's an lot of the other ones. Yeah. It's an exercise we go through on this regular exercise we go through on this regular exercise we go through on this regular basis of everyone's in a panic. How do basis of everyone's in a panic. How do basis of everyone's in a panic. How do we manage our expectations? How do we uh we manage our expectations? How do we uh we manage our expectations? How do we uh help people understand? Yes, I know this help people understand? Yes, I know this help people understand? Yes, I know this sounds bad, but we don't need to go sounds bad, but we don't need to go sounds bad, but we don't need to go reload all our services that are using reload all our services that are using reload all our services that are using Apache Parket. Let's come up with a plan Apache Parket. Let's come up with a plan Apache Parket. Let's come up with a plan to patch because we don't want to ignore to patch because we don't want to ignore to patch because we don't want to ignore it, but I'm not going to make you all it, but I'm not going to make you all it, but I'm not going to make you all stop what you're doing, pull down time, stop what you're doing, pull down time, stop what you're doing, pull down time, and do that. and do that. and do that. So, overall, these are some of the So, overall, these are some of the So, overall, these are some of the things that we look at to help us manage things that we look at to help us manage things that we look at to help us manage our plan, manage how we respond. These our plan, manage how we respond. These our plan, manage how we respond. These are the indicators, the some of the are the indicators, the some of the are the indicators, the some of the context that we find valuable. Scope of context that we find valuable. Scope of context that we find valuable. Scope of impact. Is this an application that is impact. Is this an application that is impact. Is this an application that is used by one person because it's posted, used by one person because it's posted, used by one person because it's posted, you know, somewhere on the internet and you know, somewhere on the internet and you know, somewhere on the internet and they found it useful, but no one else they found it useful, but no one else they found it useful, but no one else has it or is this an application that's has it or is this an application that's has it or is this an application that's broadly deployed, it has very popular broadly deployed, it has very popular broadly deployed, it has very popular customer base. That's one thing. Keep in customer base. That's one thing. Keep in customer base. That's one thing. Keep in mind, the goal of an attack is to mind, the goal of an attack is to mind, the goal of an attack is to compromise as many targets as you can. compromise as many targets as you can. compromise as many targets as you can. If the product's only used by one If the product's only used by one If the product's only used by one person, that's not very attractive. It's person, that's not very attractive. It's person, that's not very attractive. It's used by a lot, it's going to be more used by a lot, it's going to be more used by a lot, it's going to be more attractive. Ease of exploitation. How attractive. Ease of exploitation. How attractive. Ease of exploitation. How easy is the exploit? If the exploit easy is the exploit? If the exploit easy is the exploit? If the exploit requires a lot of complicated things requires a lot of complicated things requires a lot of complicated things happen, you got to trick someone into happen, you got to trick someone into happen, you got to trick someone into locating a malicious spark file, it's locating a malicious spark file, it's locating a malicious spark file, it's going to be a lot harder to exploit. going to be a lot harder to exploit. going to be a lot harder to exploit. Ease of attack. The exploit might be Ease of attack. The exploit might be Ease of attack. The exploit might be easy, but if you got to pivot then five easy, but if you got to pivot then five easy, but if you got to pivot then five more steps to actually make something more steps to actually make something more steps to actually make something useful useful useful happen, it's also less attractive. Um, happen, it's also less attractive. Um, happen, it's also less attractive. Um, it's it's a lot of work. You're ra again it's it's a lot of work. You're ra again it's it's a lot of work. You're ra again attackers are racing the the us. If we attackers are racing the the us. If we attackers are racing the the us. If we patch it before they get to it, then patch it before they get to it, then patch it before they get to it, then it's useless. So, if they're spending it's useless. So, if they're spending it's useless. So, if they're spending all their resources building an attack all their resources building an attack all their resources building an attack that's complicated that's complicated that's complicated uh and it goes away because of a patch, uh and it goes away because of a patch, uh and it goes away because of a patch, then uh no good. Ease of remediation. If then uh no good. Ease of remediation. If then uh no good. Ease of remediation. If it's really easy to patch, if it's easy it's really easy to patch, if it's easy it's really easy to patch, if it's easy to uh mitigate because it's a to uh mitigate because it's a to uh mitigate because it's a configuration you shouldn't have, it's configuration you shouldn't have, it's configuration you shouldn't have, it's going to be less it's not going to be going to be less it's not going to be going to be less it's not going to be around as long. Availability proof around as long. Availability proof around as long. Availability proof concept code. Like I said, that's a concept code. Like I said, that's a concept code. Like I said, that's a first step towards having an exploit first step towards having an exploit first step towards having an exploit available. Makes it easier for someone available. Makes it easier for someone available. Makes it easier for someone to pick it up off the shelf, point it at to pick it up off the shelf, point it at to pick it up off the shelf, point it at someone, weaponize it. And then the big someone, weaponize it. And then the big someone, weaponize it. And then the big one, exploitation in the wild. Once we one, exploitation in the wild. Once we one, exploitation in the wild. Once we see that, we're really going to get see that, we're really going to get see that, we're really going to get people moving on it people moving on it people moving on it because even if you're not targeted, a because even if you're not targeted, a because even if you're not targeted, a lot of this is just opportunistic lot of this is just opportunistic lot of this is just opportunistic scanning. I'm going to scan the internet scanning. I'm going to scan the internet scanning. I'm going to scan the internet for Avante Connect and I'm gonna hit for Avante Connect and I'm gonna hit for Avante Connect and I'm gonna hit whatever I can and I'm going to get some whatever I can and I'm going to get some whatever I can and I'm going to get some of them. You don't want to get hit of them. You don't want to get hit of them. You don't want to get hit opportunistically. If you're the person opportunistically. If you're the person opportunistically. If you're the person hit by the zero day, it's unfortunate hit by the zero day, it's unfortunate hit by the zero day, it's unfortunate like no one wants to have that happen. like no one wants to have that happen. like no one wants to have that happen. But I don't think there's software out But I don't think there's software out But I don't think there's software out there that doesn't have a zero day there that doesn't have a zero day there that doesn't have a zero day lurking somewhere underneath. Like lurking somewhere underneath. Like lurking somewhere underneath. Like that's just the reality of where we're that's just the reality of where we're that's just the reality of where we're at. at. at. So you want to at least go after what's So you want to at least go after what's So you want to at least go after what's exploited well. These are when we have exploited well. These are when we have exploited well. These are when we have these major events. This is how we these major events. This is how we these major events. This is how we approach it. This is how we make our approach it. This is how we make our approach it. This is how we make our decisions. Oh uh quick summary. Um you decisions. Oh uh quick summary. Um you decisions. Oh uh quick summary. Um you can build a data driven can build a data driven can build a data driven uh risk reducing BM strategy. You can uh risk reducing BM strategy. You can uh risk reducing BM strategy. You can show risk. You've got to have the right show risk. You've got to have the right show risk. You've got to have the right context. You've got to be able to context. You've got to be able to context. You've got to be able to explain here's why we're doing this. explain here's why we're doing this. explain here's why we're doing this. Here's the data that we have. We know Here's the data that we have. We know Here's the data that we have. We know these are exploited. It's manageable. these are exploited. It's manageable. these are exploited. It's manageable. It's a security program that you can uh It's a security program that you can uh It's a security program that you can uh stand behind. The context is what helps stand behind. The context is what helps stand behind. The context is what helps you do that. Numbers are great. You can you do that. Numbers are great. You can you do that. Numbers are great. You can sort, you can filter on numbers, but sort, you can filter on numbers, but sort, you can filter on numbers, but context is really useful to help explain context is really useful to help explain context is really useful to help explain why that number is bad. Why this EPSS of why that number is bad. Why this EPSS of why that number is bad. Why this EPSS of 0.001 is actually bad. It's got known 0.001 is actually bad. It's got known 0.001 is actually bad. It's got known exploitation. Also having those exploitation. Also having those exploitation. Also having those contextual data points that helps you contextual data points that helps you contextual data points that helps you have that response. So when everyone's have that response. So when everyone's have that response. So when everyone's in a panic, when everyone's saying, in a panic, when everyone's saying, in a panic, when everyone's saying, "What are we doing about our Apache perk "What are we doing about our Apache perk "What are we doing about our Apache perk services?"

We're going to going to get weaponized. We're going to going to get weaponized. We're going to work on it over the next month and have work on it over the next month and have work on it over the next month and have a manageable response without everyone a manageable response without everyone a manageable response without everyone panicking." questions. Anybody have any questions. Anybody have any questions. Anybody have any questions? I've got one coming in on questions? I've got one coming in on questions? I've got one coming in on Discord, so just give me one second, but Discord, so just give me one second, but Discord, so just give me one second, but we can take one in the room while we're we can take one in the room while we're we can take one in the room while we're waiting. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. How do you track the success of your How do you track the success of your How do you track the success of your remediation efforts over time when you remediation efforts over time when you remediation efforts over time when you have all these vulnerabilities coming have all these vulnerabilities coming have all these vulnerabilities coming in? Uh so what I would in? Uh so what I would in? Uh so what I would do track here's the vulnerabilities do track here's the vulnerabilities do track here's the vulnerabilities here's what we know is being exploited here's what we know is being exploited here's what we know is being exploited in the wild. So if you you might have in the wild. So if you you might have in the wild. So if you you might have different tables we're tracking we're different tables we're tracking we're different tables we're tracking we're reporting on ransomware vulnerabilities. reporting on ransomware vulnerabilities. reporting on ransomware vulnerabilities. I'll use that one. So you have to know I'll use that one. So you have to know I'll use that one. So you have to know which vulnerabilities in your which vulnerabilities in your which vulnerabilities in your environments which applications have environments which applications have environments which applications have that and you want to be able to measure that and you want to be able to measure that and you want to be able to measure here's the findings we had at the start here's the findings we had at the start here's the findings we had at the start of the month. here's the those findings, of the month. here's the those findings, of the month. here's the those findings, here's how many of them we've remediated here's how many of them we've remediated here's how many of them we've remediated and here's how new ones. So, you want to and here's how new ones. So, you want to and here's how new ones. So, you want to be able to report and have that data be able to report and have that data be able to report and have that data point to track. If you have the data point to track. If you have the data point to track. If you have the data point and you know the vulnerabilities point and you know the vulnerabilities point and you know the vulnerabilities and you know it's your environment, you and you know it's your environment, you and you know it's your environment, you can show build a report on here's what can show build a report on here's what can show build a report on here's what we've remediated. Couple more came in. we've remediated. Couple more came in. we've remediated. Couple more came in. Uh it's you need to have the data point Uh it's you need to have the data point Uh it's you need to have the data point of ransomware or sysv is the one that we of ransomware or sysv is the one that we of ransomware or sysv is the one that we everyone can use. Build a report on everyone can use. Build a report on everyone can use. Build a report on that. It's tied to CV so you can track that. It's tied to CV so you can track that. It's tied to CV so you can track those in your environment and build the those in your environment and build the those in your environment and build the reports off of that. reports off of that. reports off of that. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Uh, Wulcom from Picos Security. Um, I I Uh, Wulcom from Picos Security. Um, I I Uh, Wulcom from Picos Security. Um, I I like how you frame it. The environmental like how you frame it. The environmental like how you frame it. The environmental parameters are underutilized. parameters are underutilized. parameters are underutilized. Definitely, it's a good move there. And Definitely, it's a good move there. And Definitely, it's a good move there. And in the environmental parameters, there's in the environmental parameters, there's in the environmental parameters, there's also the compensating controls. Uh, what also the compensating controls. Uh, what also the compensating controls. Uh, what do you think about that? It's also very do you think about that? It's also very do you think about that? It's also very uh underutilized or not not much data is uh underutilized or not not much data is uh underutilized or not not much data is about there. So, any thoughts about about there. So, any thoughts about about there. So, any thoughts about tannable moving forward with that? Um I tannable moving forward with that? Um I tannable moving forward with that? Um I I think compensating controls are a I think compensating controls are a I think compensating controls are a useful it's a useful mechanism. It be useful it's a useful mechanism. It be useful it's a useful mechanism. It be hard uh to fit that from an overall hard uh to fit that from an overall hard uh to fit that from an overall picture and prove I have this comp picture and prove I have this comp picture and prove I have this comp compensating control and do it in a compensating control and do it in a compensating control and do it in a reportable way. But if you have the reportable way. But if you have the reportable way. But if you have the ability to show this application is ability to show this application is ability to show this application is blocked by this firewall so I reduce blocked by this firewall so I reduce blocked by this firewall so I reduce some of the risk or I have EDR tool some of the risk or I have EDR tool some of the risk or I have EDR tool that's going to prevent this sort of that's going to prevent this sort of that's going to prevent this sort of attack. I think it's a great way if you attack. I think it's a great way if you attack. I think it's a great way if you can measure it and track it to also can measure it and track it to also can measure it and track it to also factor that into your context. factor that into your context. factor that into your context. Hey, I'll be nice. Um, I appreciated you Hey, I'll be nice. Um, I appreciated you Hey, I'll be nice. Um, I appreciated you talking about the kind of the riskbased talking about the kind of the riskbased talking about the kind of the riskbased do the assessments, the context, etc. do the assessments, the context, etc. do the assessments, the context, etc. What do you say to your customers who What do you say to your customers who What do you say to your customers who don't have time to create their own don't have time to create their own don't have time to create their own vulnerability management process and vulnerability management process and vulnerability management process and they're just tenable says X so I believe they're just tenable says X so I believe they're just tenable says X so I believe it and that's it and they it's like zero it and that's it and they it's like zero it and that's it and they it's like zero context that's it cuz you're going to context that's it cuz you're going to context that's it cuz you're going to see all those criticals and highs and see all those criticals and highs and see all those criticals and highs and they're not doing any additional work they're not doing any additional work they're not doing any additional work and they're like this is all I believe. and they're like this is all I believe. and they're like this is all I believe. So what do you say that your customers So what do you say that your customers So what do you say that your customers who do that? So one of the things we've who do that? So one of the things we've who do that? So one of the things we've done actually done actually done actually is I I kind of look as we've got your is I I kind of look as we've got your is I I kind of look as we've got your compliance base if you're going to just compliance base if you're going to just compliance base if you're going to just do CVS. We have capabilities now that we do CVS. We have capabilities now that we do CVS. We have capabilities now that we are trying to get customer use where you are trying to get customer use where you are trying to get customer use where you can build they can actually build their can build they can actually build their can build they can actually build their reports on ransomware or on persistently reports on ransomware or on persistently reports on ransomware or on persistently exploited. So they can use that data. exploited. So they can use that data. exploited. So they can use that data. It's actually in the product. They can It's actually in the product. They can It's actually in the product. They can look and they say all right here's I'm look and they say all right here's I'm look and they say all right here's I'm tracking all my CVS. I have an tracking all my CVS. I have an tracking all my CVS. I have an initiative. I'm focused on ransomware initiative. I'm focused on ransomware initiative. I'm focused on ransomware and I'm going to track this initiative and I'm going to track this initiative and I'm going to track this initiative over the entire year and show I got my over the entire year and show I got my over the entire year and show I got my ransomware vulnerabilities down to here ransomware vulnerabilities down to here ransomware vulnerabilities down to here got like 1% and from you know 80%. So I got like 1% and from you know 80%. So I got like 1% and from you know 80%. So I what I do is push them towards those um what I do is push them towards those um what I do is push them towards those um those capabilities that let you take a those capabilities that let you take a those capabilities that let you take a riskbased approach on it. Sorry I got another question uh in Sorry I got another question uh in Sorry I got another question uh in Discord. Uh this is from Candace. Can Discord. Uh this is from Candace. Can Discord. Uh this is from Candace. Can you give some concrete examples of ro you give some concrete examples of ro you give some concrete examples of ro buckets for contextual prioritization? buckets for contextual prioritization? buckets for contextual prioritization? I've heard recommendations for example I've heard recommendations for example I've heard recommendations for example to flag seuite devices or is that a bad to flag seuite devices or is that a bad to flag seuite devices or is that a bad idea in general? Um it's going to be idea in general? Um it's going to be idea in general? Um it's going to be very dependent on your environment and I very dependent on your environment and I very dependent on your environment and I actually like a lot of discussions I actually like a lot of discussions I actually like a lot of discussions I hear sort of this pitch of like yeah I hear sort of this pitch of like yeah I hear sort of this pitch of like yeah I can identify the seuite you know device can identify the seuite you know device can identify the seuite you know device and that's bad if they've got you know and that's bad if they've got you know and that's bad if they've got you know vulnerabilities. I'm actually a lot more vulnerabilities. I'm actually a lot more vulnerabilities. I'm actually a lot more concerned about the senior staff concerned about the senior staff concerned about the senior staff software engineer who has access to software engineer who has access to software engineer who has access to every single resource. They've got every single resource. They've got every single resource. They've got GitHub GitHub GitHub access that I'm access that I'm access that I'm I'm myself I'm probably ter like I don't I'm myself I'm probably ter like I don't I'm myself I'm probably ter like I don't want anything. want anything. want anything. Uh so it depends on your environment Uh so it depends on your environment Uh so it depends on your environment like your support person that it's going like your support person that it's going like your support person that it's going to be a different they may have access to be a different they may have access to be a different they may have access to the support portal and that could to the support portal and that could to the support portal and that could cause uh some damage. So you want to cause uh some damage. So you want to cause uh some damage. So you want to understand your environment what your b understand your environment what your b understand your environment what your b biggest risks are. seuite. It's biggest risks are. seuite. It's biggest risks are. seuite. It's definitely bad, but there my guess is definitely bad, but there my guess is definitely bad, but there my guess is you're probably going to have more of a you're probably going to have more of a you're probably going to have more of a um reputational impact than um reputational impact than um reputational impact than a I hope your seuite's not logging in a I hope your seuite's not logging in a I hope your seuite's not logging in and committing code. So, I love your con your comp your code. So, I love your con your comp your code. So, I love your con your comp your slides about uh temporal um CBSS slides about uh temporal um CBSS slides about uh temporal um CBSS components and the other one. Great. components and the other one. Great. components and the other one. Great. Environmental was we have 50,000 Environmental was we have 50,000 Environmental was we have 50,000 vulnerabilities. I can't manually vulnerabilities. I can't manually vulnerabilities. I can't manually calculate the temporal and environmental calculate the temporal and environmental calculate the temporal and environmental for all of them. How do we automate that for all of them. How do we automate that for all of them. How do we automate that process? So when I'm looking at process? So when I'm looking at process? So when I'm looking at everything because again I don't want to everything because again I don't want to everything because again I don't want to just look at the base for 90% of them just look at the base for 90% of them just look at the base for 90% of them and 10% I'm going to put the rest of and 10% I'm going to put the rest of and 10% I'm going to put the rest of them in. How do I automate that so I them in. How do I automate that so I them in. How do I automate that so I have a good uh objective normalization have a good uh objective normalization have a good uh objective normalization of all my vulnerabilities? of all my vulnerabilities? of all my vulnerabilities? Yeah. So it's it's a me you want to be Yeah. So it's it's a me you want to be Yeah. So it's it's a me you want to be able to you know tag your assets if you able to you know tag your assets if you able to you know tag your assets if you can. So these are all my assets that are can. So these are all my assets that are can. So these are all my assets that are low low information risk or low low low information risk or low low low information risk or low confidentiality risk and then be able to confidentiality risk and then be able to confidentiality risk and then be able to build uh some capabilities either within build uh some capabilities either within build uh some capabilities either within whatever tool you're using or externally whatever tool you're using or externally whatever tool you're using or externally that takes the base score then your own that takes the base score then your own that takes the base score then your own tags that say these are the low risk tags that say these are the low risk tags that say these are the low risk ones or these are mitigated by a ones or these are mitigated by a ones or these are mitigated by a compensating control and have processes compensating control and have processes compensating control and have processes that can do that. Um it it's going to that can do that. Um it it's going to that can do that. Um it it's going to depend on what tool you have. Um uh but depend on what tool you have. Um uh but depend on what tool you have. Um uh but you defin it's the most important is you defin it's the most important is you defin it's the most important is knowing what your assets are and knowing knowing what your assets are and knowing knowing what your assets are and knowing where they are and being able to tag where they are and being able to tag where they are and being able to tag them and track that easily. Any other questions? Oh, one more over there. questions? Oh, one more over there. questions? Oh, one more over there. Thank you. So, I know with a lot of vulnerability So, I know with a lot of vulnerability So, I know with a lot of vulnerability scanners, they'll show like confirmed scanners, they'll show like confirmed scanners, they'll show like confirmed vulnerabilities and potentials. You vulnerabilities and potentials. You vulnerabilities and potentials. You weigh that in to um I guess the weigh that in to um I guess the weigh that in to um I guess the methodology for analyzing when you have methodology for analyzing when you have methodology for analyzing when you have like like like 50,000. So, you have something that 50,000. So, you have something that 50,000. So, you have something that would be very critical if it was would be very critical if it was would be very critical if it was confirmed to be true, but you know, confirmed to be true, but you know, confirmed to be true, but you know, we're not really sure if the systems we're not really sure if the systems we're not really sure if the systems impacted. Yeah. Uh so to me that confirm impacted. Yeah. Uh so to me that confirm impacted. Yeah. Uh so to me that confirm versus potential is something we've versus potential is something we've versus potential is something we've talked about a lot talked about a lot talked about a lot is confirmed is a thing it's a really is confirmed is a thing it's a really is confirmed is a thing it's a really useful mechanism to have SLAs's on. So useful mechanism to have SLAs's on. So useful mechanism to have SLAs's on. So again this is that trust factor. If it's again this is that trust factor. If it's again this is that trust factor. If it's confirmed go give someone a really confirmed go give someone a really confirmed go give someone a really aggressive SLA say you've got to fix it aggressive SLA say you've got to fix it aggressive SLA say you've got to fix it in three days. You're not worried that in three days. You're not worried that in three days. You're not worried that they're going to come back and argue they're going to come back and argue they're going to come back and argue with you about false positives and I with you about false positives and I with you about false positives and I can't do this and I can't do that. So can't do this and I can't do that. So can't do this and I can't do that. So where I find it useful is if it's where I find it useful is if it's where I find it useful is if it's confirmed just start hitting those confirmed just start hitting those confirmed just start hitting those SLAs's really aggressively. The SLAs's really aggressively. The SLAs's really aggressively. The potential uh in principle what you want potential uh in principle what you want potential uh in principle what you want to do is say okay here's my bucket of to do is say okay here's my bucket of to do is say okay here's my bucket of potentials. These ones are really bad. potentials. These ones are really bad. potentials. These ones are really bad. So I'm going to go do some in action So I'm going to go do some in action So I'm going to go do some in action analysis. I'll talk to the team that analysis. I'll talk to the team that analysis. I'll talk to the team that owns the assets and say are you running owns the assets and say are you running owns the assets and say are you running in this configuration? Are you doing in this configuration? Are you doing in this configuration? Are you doing this? So you're going to put a lot more this? So you're going to put a lot more this? So you're going to put a lot more work into triaging those. But the value work into triaging those. But the value work into triaging those. But the value I find in confirm versus potential is I find in confirm versus potential is I find in confirm versus potential is you don't kill the trust when you go you don't kill the trust when you go you don't kill the trust when you go tell someone to go fix something and tell someone to go fix something and tell someone to go fix something and they say I'm not vulnerable because of x they say I'm not vulnerable because of x they say I'm not vulnerable because of x y and z or I already fixed it. y and z or I already fixed it. y and z or I already fixed it. So then when you have that sort of So then when you have that sort of So then when you have that sort of bucket that you've got a triage then you bucket that you've got a triage then you bucket that you've got a triage then you prioritize that based on you know real prioritize that based on you know real prioritize that based on you know real risk versus perceived risk. Um so obviously you don't want to risk. Um so obviously you don't want to risk. Um so obviously you don't want to have big costs incurred by downtime. have big costs incurred by downtime. have big costs incurred by downtime. don't want to destroy trust in your don't want to destroy trust in your don't want to destroy trust in your customers or your partners. How do you, customers or your partners. How do you, customers or your partners. How do you, I guess, navigate the need for risk I guess, navigate the need for risk I guess, navigate the need for risk tolerance, the need to patch these tolerance, the need to patch these tolerance, the need to patch these vulnerabilities? How do you figure out vulnerabilities? How do you figure out vulnerabilities? How do you figure out where that inflection point is where you where that inflection point is where you where that inflection point is where you need to take your services down? That is need to take your services down? That is need to take your services down? That is that's going to depend on every that's going to depend on every that's going to depend on every organization. I mean, you got to look at organization. I mean, you got to look at organization. I mean, you got to look at the cost of, you know, what is that the cost of, you know, what is that the cost of, you know, what is that downtime? Can can you roll through it downtime? Can can you roll through it downtime? Can can you roll through it because you've got, you know, load because you've got, you know, load because you've got, you know, load balancing. So, you do this server, then balancing. So, you do this server, then balancing. So, you do this server, then this server, then this server. Um, you this server, then this server. Um, you this server, then this server. Um, you know, how bad is this thing being know, how bad is this thing being know, how bad is this thing being exploited by every single attacker exploited by every single attacker exploited by every single attacker everywhere in the world? Is it, you everywhere in the world? Is it, you everywhere in the world? Is it, you know, log for shell that I there's a know, log for shell that I there's a know, log for shell that I there's a part of me that keeps saying I wish part of me that keeps saying I wish part of me that keeps saying I wish there was a new one because I'm tired of there was a new one because I'm tired of there was a new one because I'm tired of saying log for shell, but I really don't saying log for shell, but I really don't saying log for shell, but I really don't want another want another want another one. No. Um, you know, so it it's all one. No. Um, you know, so it it's all one. No. Um, you know, so it it's all about weighing risk. The most important about weighing risk. The most important about weighing risk. The most important thing when you have to do that, uh, thing when you have to do that, uh, thing when you have to do that, uh, ideally, whatever your prioritization, ideally, whatever your prioritization, ideally, whatever your prioritization, however you're deciding, you've got buy however you're deciding, you've got buy however you're deciding, you've got buy in. So you can go to the team and say, in. So you can go to the team and say, in. So you can go to the team and say, "Here's how we've come to this decision. "Here's how we've come to this decision. "Here's how we've come to this decision. It's not because everyone's screaming It's not because everyone's screaming It's not because everyone's screaming about it. We're looking for about it. We're looking for about it. We're looking for vulnerabilities that are known to be vulnerabilities that are known to be vulnerabilities that are known to be exploited are being actively exploited. exploited are being actively exploited. exploited are being actively exploited. We're coming to you because this one is We're coming to you because this one is We're coming to you because this one is known to be exploited, everyone's known to be exploited, everyone's known to be exploited, everyone's attacking it, and we're vulnerable. So attacking it, and we're vulnerable. So attacking it, and we're vulnerable. So it it's going to depend on a lot of factors. Anybody got any other questions? All right. Thank you, Luke. questions? All right. Thank you, Luke. questions? All right. Thank you, Luke. Appreciate it.
