Kind: captions Language: en mainly Pete and I just were thinking mainly Pete and I just were thinking mainly Pete and I just were thinking that we would love to have a that we would love to have a that we would love to have a conversation with interested parties conversation with interested parties conversation with interested parties about what what they're thinking about about what what they're thinking about about what what they're thinking about in terms of VEX. Um, Red Hat's doing it in terms of VEX. Um, Red Hat's doing it in terms of VEX. Um, Red Hat's doing it and I feel strong I'm Lisa from and I feel strong I'm Lisa from and I feel strong I'm Lisa from Microsoft. Um, I feel very strongly Microsoft. Um, I feel very strongly Microsoft. Um, I feel very strongly that we need to to be in sync as an that we need to to be in sync as an that we need to to be in sync as an industry and do it the same. And um we industry and do it the same. And um we industry and do it the same. And um we need to work with the scanning vendors need to work with the scanning vendors need to work with the scanning vendors so that they can read it. We need to if so that they can read it. We need to if so that they can read it. We need to if if Qualace is reading Red Hat's VEX if Qualace is reading Red Hat's VEX if Qualace is reading Red Hat's VEX files, I don't want them to have to files, I don't want them to have to files, I don't want them to have to develop a whole new plug-in to to read develop a whole new plug-in to to read develop a whole new plug-in to to read Microsoft VEX files. Um but the fact is Microsoft VEX files. Um but the fact is Microsoft VEX files. Um but the fact is VEX is still emerging and nobody really VEX is still emerging and nobody really VEX is still emerging and nobody really owns it yet. So, we need as an industry owns it yet. So, we need as an industry owns it yet. So, we need as an industry to to to make sure that somebody does to to to make sure that somebody does to to to make sure that somebody does own it and that we're kind of doing it own it and that we're kind of doing it own it and that we're kind of doing it the same way because I believe and I'll the same way because I believe and I'll the same way because I believe and I'll let Pete weigh in in a second that VEX let Pete weigh in in a second that VEX let Pete weigh in in a second that VEX can make a significant difference in the can make a significant difference in the can make a significant difference in the future if we implement it future if we implement it future if we implement it well. And and so it's going to take us well. And and so it's going to take us well. And and so it's going to take us to talk and keep communicating in order to talk and keep communicating in order to talk and keep communicating in order to implement it well. And so so that's to implement it well. And so so that's to implement it well. And so so that's why I feel very strongly that as an why I feel very strongly that as an why I feel very strongly that as an industry need we need to work together industry need we need to work together industry need we need to work together to do it together. to do it together. to do it together. So there's two parts of that. One is how So there's two parts of that. One is how So there's two parts of that. One is how we all produce that information and we all produce that information and we all produce that information and having a common way of doing VEX is very having a common way of doing VEX is very having a common way of doing VEX is very very important because without very important because without very important because without that well who's going to listen and it's that well who's going to listen and it's that well who's going to listen and it's about adoption. The second part of that about adoption. The second part of that about adoption. The second part of that is we have to have a way for the is we have to have a way for the is we have to have a way for the consumer enterprise level to understand consumer enterprise level to understand consumer enterprise level to understand what is that data and what what does it what is that data and what what does it what is that data and what what does it mean to them and unfortunately for a mean to them and unfortunately for a mean to them and unfortunately for a long period of time we've also looked at long period of time we've also looked at long period of time we've also looked at a vulnerability is a a vulnerability is a a vulnerability is a risk and vulnerabilities contribute to risk and vulnerabilities contribute to risk and vulnerabilities contribute to what risk what risk what risk is but somewhere along that journey it is but somewhere along that journey it is but somewhere along that journey it got lost to the end user. So, how do we got lost to the end user. So, how do we got lost to the end user. So, how do we inform them? And this comes to the inform them? And this comes to the inform them? And this comes to the second part of the equation, which is second part of the equation, which is second part of the equation, which is the vendor scanners being able to take the vendor scanners being able to take the vendor scanners being able to take that information in that information in that information in from all of us producers in a way that from all of us producers in a way that from all of us producers in a way that is common and easy for is common and easy for is common and easy for them. Otherwise, what do we give in the them. Otherwise, what do we give in the them. Otherwise, what do we give in the way of way of way of data? And I'm going to give an example data? And I'm going to give an example data? And I'm going to give an example today. I was talking to quote a today. I was talking to quote a today. I was talking to quote a customer and as I was talking to this customer and as I was talking to this customer and as I was talking to this it's one of those major sectors and I'm it's one of those major sectors and I'm it's one of those major sectors and I'm talking to a contracting officer. You know if you ever had a officer. You know if you ever had a officer. You know if you ever had a chance to do one of those vendor things chance to do one of those vendor things chance to do one of those vendor things where you talk to a contracting officer, where you talk to a contracting officer, where you talk to a contracting officer, they're usually filling in a series of they're usually filling in a series of they're usually filling in a series of blanks and we happened on CVS and what blanks and we happened on CVS and what blanks and we happened on CVS and what the ratings the ratings the ratings were and I said we don't rate that way. were and I said we don't rate that way. were and I said we don't rate that way. we rate with a severity we rate with a severity we rate with a severity scale. He goes, "Oh," and I'm trying to scale. He goes, "Oh," and I'm trying to scale. He goes, "Oh," and I'm trying to get as quote close to the quote as as a get as quote close to the quote as as a get as quote close to the quote as as a customer stated. customer stated. customer stated. Um, we're getting a lot of push back Um, we're getting a lot of push back Um, we're getting a lot of push back from vendors about from vendors about from vendors about CVSS because the base score is being CVSS because the base score is being CVSS because the base score is being overrun with environmental overrun with environmental overrun with environmental inputs and so it doesn't work very well. inputs and so it doesn't work very well. inputs and so it doesn't work very well. And I'm going And I'm going And I'm going like I usually have to explain this in like I usually have to explain this in like I usually have to explain this in great detail over 10 minutes to get the great detail over 10 minutes to get the great detail over 10 minutes to get the other side to kind of say h other side to kind of say h other side to kind of say h maybe. But the fact that customers are maybe. But the fact that customers are maybe. But the fact that customers are picking up on that means that we have a picking up on that means that we have a picking up on that means that we have a problem in the problem in the problem in the industry. And when I say the industry I industry. And when I say the industry I industry. And when I say the industry I don't mean just the don't mean just the don't mean just the producers. It's the aggregators. It is producers. It's the aggregators. It is producers. It's the aggregators. It is the vendor scanners. So where do we draw the vendor scanners. So where do we draw the vendor scanners. So where do we draw that ability to transmit that that ability to transmit that that ability to transmit that information and information and information and stop well interessing warfare for lack stop well interessing warfare for lack stop well interessing warfare for lack of a better term where he of a better term where he of a better term where he said she said and they said she said and they said she said and they said it was bad with two. You get three said it was bad with two. You get three said it was bad with two. You get three parties in there and we all know parties in there and we all know parties in there and we all know everyone's quotes back to MVD. I'm just everyone's quotes back to MVD. I'm just everyone's quotes back to MVD. I'm just going to call it because that's an going to call it because that's an going to call it because that's an aggregator and unfortunately the aggregator and unfortunately the aggregator and unfortunately the customer segment is lost on that. They customer segment is lost on that. They customer segment is lost on that. They look at as an authoritative look at as an authoritative look at as an authoritative source and that's why we need to have source and that's why we need to have source and that's why we need to have this this this conversation. Did Did we jump in ahead conversation. Did Did we jump in ahead conversation. Did Did we jump in ahead of does does everybody know what we're of does does everybody know what we're of does does everybody know what we're talking about? Everybody understands VEX talking about? Everybody understands VEX talking about? Everybody understands VEX and and how we get there. Is that and and how we get there. Is that and and how we get there. Is that right? Okay. Good. I was hoping we just right? Okay. Good. I was hoping we just right? Okay. Good. I was hoping we just didn't dive into the deep didn't dive into the deep didn't dive into the deep end and catch everybody off guard. The end and catch everybody off guard. The end and catch everybody off guard. The it's unfortunately in our business you it's unfortunately in our business you it's unfortunately in our business you assume everyone is on the same level you assume everyone is on the same level you assume everyone is on the same level you are and uh that's not necessarily always are and uh that's not necessarily always are and uh that's not necessarily always the case. So the first comment we're the case. So the first comment we're the case. So the first comment we're asking is as uh asking is as uh asking is as uh producers and I'm going to assume the producers and I'm going to assume the producers and I'm going to assume the vast who's not a producer here. Do we vast who's not a producer here. Do we vast who's not a producer here. Do we have any scanning vendors here? What's that? Consumer. Okay, consumers What's that? Consumer. Okay, consumers What's that? Consumer. Okay, consumers is just as important. Thank you. Because is just as important. Thank you. Because is just as important. Thank you. Because that was my next question because those that was my next question because those that was my next question because those are three major things. I I was talking are three major things. I I was talking are three major things. I I was talking to uh an attendee earlier today and to uh an attendee earlier today and to uh an attendee earlier today and we're trying to describe what that we're trying to describe what that we're trying to describe what that problem set looks like and there's problem set looks like and there's problem set looks like and there's there's producers and you can have there's producers and you can have there's producers and you can have researchers and all that who are subs uh researchers and all that who are subs uh researchers and all that who are subs uh kicking in. You have um scanning vendors kicking in. You have um scanning vendors kicking in. You have um scanning vendors which are used more or less as a which are used more or less as a which are used more or less as a translator of the problem set. Then you translator of the problem set. Then you translator of the problem set. Then you have consumers. When I say that I'm have consumers. When I say that I'm have consumers. When I say that I'm talking about enterprise level talking about enterprise level talking about enterprise level consumers, okay, just uh there's no uh consumers, okay, just uh there's no uh consumers, okay, just uh there's no uh loss translation there because you look loss translation there because you look loss translation there because you look at producers and consumers are in in the at producers and consumers are in in the at producers and consumers are in in the NIA sbomb stuff. So um I'm trying to NIA sbomb stuff. So um I'm trying to NIA sbomb stuff. So um I'm trying to follow a little bit of convention. So if follow a little bit of convention. So if follow a little bit of convention. So if those three groups are out of line and those three groups are out of line and those three groups are out of line and then you have this thing over to the then you have this thing over to the then you have this thing over to the side which is an aggregator which side which is an aggregator which side which is an aggregator which everyone is pointing to and CVE is everyone is pointing to and CVE is everyone is pointing to and CVE is a cornerstone of at least a cornerstone of at least a cornerstone of at least identifying then we have to figure out identifying then we have to figure out identifying then we have to figure out what our data flow what our data flow what our data flow is and what does that mean for a large is and what does that mean for a large is and what does that mean for a large part of us the question part of us the question part of us the question is did you give me a complete is did you give me a complete is did you give me a complete record? Can you tell me to what level record? Can you tell me to what level record? Can you tell me to what level the problem is and how come you see it the problem is and how come you see it the problem is and how come you see it that way? And can you give me that way? And can you give me that way? And can you give me state? This is an important part because state? This is an important part because state? This is an important part because for years everyone used to use a a web for years everyone used to use a a web for years everyone used to use a a web page, right? And then when things page, right? And then when things page, right? And then when things change, you produce something you send change, you produce something you send change, you produce something you send an an an email. How are we doing it email. How are we doing it email. How are we doing it now? Come to my now? Come to my now? Come to my website. Go to MVD's website. Go to MVD's website. Go to MVD's website. Go to CVE's website. website. Go to CVE's website. website. Go to CVE's website. And I think we could actually transmit And I think we could actually transmit And I think we could actually transmit that quicker and more that quicker and more that quicker and more complete. Did you want anything add complete. Did you want anything add complete. Did you want anything add anything? So who out there is is working anything? So who out there is is working anything? So who out there is is working on a VEX solution some for either right on a VEX solution some for either right on a VEX solution some for either right now which I know Red Hat is uh or in the now which I know Red Hat is uh or in the now which I know Red Hat is uh or in the future. So let me ask you all a question. So let me ask you all a question. So let me ask you all a question. you raise your hand of in the you raise your hand of in the you raise your hand of in the future what is the inhibitor for you to future what is the inhibitor for you to future what is the inhibitor for you to get there and Christina since you're get there and Christina since you're get there and Christina since you're closest to Mike do you mean on the closest to Mike do you mean on the closest to Mike do you mean on the ingestion side or the production side ingestion side or the production side ingestion side or the production side production okay so yes we are planning production okay so yes we are planning production okay so yes we are planning to produce vex documents for customers to produce vex documents for customers to produce vex documents for customers um there's not really any inhibition um there's not really any inhibition um there's not really any inhibition right now and I wish David and Jonathan right now and I wish David and Jonathan right now and I wish David and Jonathan were in the room because they are were in the room because they are were in the room because they are actually handson actually handson actually handson Um I think Um I think Um I think the the the biggest blocker is probably the the the biggest blocker is probably the the the biggest blocker is probably uh knowing the standards, being educated uh knowing the standards, being educated uh knowing the standards, being educated on the standards and and having the on the standards and and having the on the standards and and having the right CVE data, having all the fields right CVE data, having all the fields right CVE data, having all the fields filled in, you know, like getting making filled in, you know, like getting making filled in, you know, like getting making sure you have all the metadata. sure you have all the metadata. sure you have all the metadata. Okay. So that's as a producer, right? Okay. So that's as a producer, right? Okay. So that's as a producer, right? Okay. But you actually opened the second Okay. But you actually opened the second Okay. But you actually opened the second question as an ingest, question as an ingest, question as an ingest, right? Ingesting Vex. Wow. Well, that's right? Ingesting Vex. Wow. Well, that's right? Ingesting Vex. Wow. Well, that's a can of worms that we have not really a can of worms that we have not really a can of worms that we have not really touched yet. We ingest SPDXS bombs and touched yet. We ingest SPDXS bombs and touched yet. We ingest SPDXS bombs and that's fairly straightforward. But that's fairly straightforward. But that's fairly straightforward. But ingesting VEX is a whole another can of ingesting VEX is a whole another can of ingesting VEX is a whole another can of worms we have not touched yet. worms we have not touched yet. worms we have not touched yet. And I want you to note something. And I want you to note something. And I want you to note something. Cisco's ingesting sbombs, which I think Cisco's ingesting sbombs, which I think Cisco's ingesting sbombs, which I think is a is a is a rarity. Uh when I talk to customers, rarity. Uh when I talk to customers, rarity. Uh when I talk to customers, I've only seen one uh who ingested the I've only seen one uh who ingested the I've only seen one uh who ingested the sbomb and actually use it for V sbomb and actually use it for V sbomb and actually use it for V management. The rest were two. Okay. Uh management. The rest were two. Okay. Uh management. The rest were two. Okay. Uh I'll count Cisco. That's three now. Um I'll count Cisco. That's three now. Um I'll count Cisco. That's three now. Um the rest were check to block the rest were check to block the rest were check to block compliance. Okay. Um could you pass over compliance. Okay. Um could you pass over compliance. Okay. Um could you pass over to John in the red t-shirt there? What's inhibiting or what are you What's inhibiting or what are you What's inhibiting or what are you producing? Are you ingesting or you're producing? Are you ingesting or you're producing? Are you ingesting or you're waiting for something? We're waiting on waiting for something? We're waiting on waiting for something? We're waiting on the data. We're waiting on that the data. We're waiting on that the data. We're waiting on that structured data to be able to actually structured data to be able to actually structured data to be able to actually do it. do it. do it. Okay. And and what would you look for or Okay. And and what would you look for or Okay. And and what would you look for or is that structured data? Pass that to is that structured data? Pass that to is that structured data? Pass that to Megazone. Megazone. Megazone. Give it to the geek. Uh so yeah, it's Give it to the geek. Uh so yeah, it's Give it to the geek. Uh so yeah, it's mostly internally it's getting it's mostly internally it's getting it's mostly internally it's getting it's hurting the cats getting all the data hurting the cats getting all the data hurting the cats getting all the data together. I mean we're the C we we together. I mean we're the C we we together. I mean we're the C we we handle mostly our first party handle mostly our first party handle mostly our first party vulnerabilities but we want to be able vulnerabilities but we want to be able vulnerabilities but we want to be able to feed first and third party we have to feed first and third party we have to feed first and third party we have low lot of third party code in our low lot of third party code in our low lot of third party code in our products uh and so being able to produce products uh and so being able to produce products uh and so being able to produce that VEX feed right now is there's there that VEX feed right now is there's there that VEX feed right now is there's there are internal efforts to get that are internal efforts to get that are internal efforts to get that together but it's getting all the together but it's getting all the together but it's getting all the different production groups all the different production groups all the different production groups all the different product groups to provide that different product groups to provide that different product groups to provide that data in a consistent format that we can data in a consistent format that we can data in a consistent format that we can then put into a VEX document and so then put into a VEX document and so then put into a VEX document and so there's a lot of education going on you there's a lot of education going on you there's a lot of education going on you know what is VEX what do you what do you know what is VEX what do you what do you know what is VEX what do you what do you know what do we need from you what know what do we need from you what know what do we need from you what structured data do we need and all this structured data do we need and all this structured data do we need and all this stuff so it's it's it's a lot of stuff so it's it's it's a lot of stuff so it's it's it's a lot of internal education right now I think is internal education right now I think is internal education right now I think is our biggest hurdle is just getting our biggest hurdle is just getting our biggest hurdle is just getting everybody educated and and understanding everybody educated and and understanding everybody educated and and understanding why we are doing this and why it's not why we are doing this and why it's not why we are doing this and why it's not just some fun project we want to do just some fun project we want to do just some fun project we want to do so I'm going to ask you a couple so I'm going to ask you a couple so I'm going to ask you a couple questions uh if you don't mind me um questions uh if you don't mind me um questions uh if you don't mind me um when you talk across all those groups when you talk across all those groups when you talk across all those groups and you're trying to find out what they and you're trying to find out what they and you're trying to find out what they have is that a manifest challenge have is that a manifest challenge have is that a manifest challenge meaning you're trying to gather that meaning you're trying to gather that meaning you're trying to gather that information about what's there for your information about what's there for your information about what's there for your sbomb or is it a different challenge? sbomb or is it a different challenge? sbomb or is it a different challenge? Uh, a little of both. We sbombs, we Uh, a little of both. We sbombs, we Uh, a little of both. We sbombs, we actually have sbombs now for most of our actually have sbombs now for most of our actually have sbombs now for most of our stuff. There are a couple of teams that stuff. There are a couple of teams that stuff. There are a couple of teams that are lagging. They're supposed to have are lagging. They're supposed to have are lagging. They're supposed to have everyone's supposed to have the sbombs everyone's supposed to have the sbombs everyone's supposed to have the sbombs ready. Whether or not they actually do, ready. Whether or not they actually do, ready. Whether or not they actually do, most a lot of the teams do at this most a lot of the teams do at this most a lot of the teams do at this point. Um, that that effort was has been point. Um, that that effort was has been point. Um, that that effort was has been largely completed. We've been working on largely completed. We've been working on largely completed. We've been working on that already. Um but it's like getting that already. Um but it's like getting that already. Um but it's like getting the individual there's the S problem is the individual there's the S problem is the individual there's the S problem is fine but it's also fine but it's also fine but it's also evaluating let's just pick on like evaluating let's just pick on like evaluating let's just pick on like OpenSSL right we have OpenSSL we use it OpenSSL right we have OpenSSL we use it OpenSSL right we have OpenSSL we use it in our product they publish a CVE but we in our product they publish a CVE but we in our product they publish a CVE but we have to re-evaluate it for our use of have to re-evaluate it for our use of have to re-evaluate it for our use of that and not just echo whatever opensl that and not just echo whatever opensl that and not just echo whatever opensl published so if we're going to publish published so if we're going to publish published so if we're going to publish vex documents for our products we need vex documents for our products we need vex documents for our products we need that analysis done for every third party that analysis done for every third party that analysis done for every third party package of are we affected by this are package of are we affected by this are package of are we affected by this are we not affected by this so we can we not affected by this so we can we not affected by this so we can publish information to our customers publish information to our customers publish information to our customers that reflects our use of things. So, you said a couple things I thought So, you said a couple things I thought So, you said a couple things I thought were uh telling and interesting and were uh telling and interesting and were uh telling and interesting and we'll use OpenSSL as our our vehicle for we'll use OpenSSL as our our vehicle for we'll use OpenSSL as our our vehicle for discussion. Okay. Um what I heard was discussion. Okay. Um what I heard was discussion. Okay. Um what I heard was that there's an upstream that comes in that there's an upstream that comes in that there's an upstream that comes in open a cell in this case and they have a open a cell in this case and they have a open a cell in this case and they have a CVE assigned. The question is how it CVE assigned. The question is how it CVE assigned. The question is how it affects affects affects you. Okay. And then I would assume the you. Okay. And then I would assume the you. Okay. And then I would assume the the question is how do you inform the the question is how do you inform the the question is how do you inform the customer about that? customer about that? customer about that? And I I I know you write your your own And I I I know you write your your own And I I I know you write your your own advisory. So you you probably already advisory. So you you probably already advisory. So you you probably already write that, right? The question is how write that, right? The question is how write that, right? The question is how can you automate the delivery, right? can you automate the delivery, right? can you automate the delivery, right? Okay. So we don't have any security Okay. So we don't have any security Okay. So we don't have any security vendors in here, right? vendors in here, right? vendors in here, right? Because a question I would ask them uh Because a question I would ask them uh Because a question I would ask them uh is how do you get it? And uh we talked is how do you get it? And uh we talked is how do you get it? And uh we talked to a lot of security vendors. So I'll to a lot of security vendors. So I'll to a lot of security vendors. So I'll just kind of profer what they've told just kind of profer what they've told just kind of profer what they've told us. Number one source us. Number one source us. Number one source NVD. Most of them say about 90% of their NVD. Most of them say about 90% of their NVD. Most of them say about 90% of their data is data is data is NVD. Number two NVD. Number two NVD. Number two OSVDB. Number OSVDB. Number OSVDB. Number three, a sunundry others. Number four, their evaluation. Anyone have a problem with that? How about as a customer, Jennifer? Yeah. I'm sorry. I customer, Jennifer? Yeah. I'm sorry. I customer, Jennifer? Yeah. I'm sorry. I don't have my glasses on to read it don't have my glasses on to read it don't have my glasses on to read it right. Um, does that work for you? I 100% follow with you. Okay. So, I'm I 100% follow with you. Okay. So, I'm I 100% follow with you. Okay. So, I'm gonna let Martin do it. That's okay. gonna let Martin do it. That's okay. gonna let Martin do it. That's okay. No. So, for us, of course, we all the No. So, for us, of course, we all the No. So, for us, of course, we all the public sources they are not enough. They public sources they are not enough. They public sources they are not enough. They are very incomplete and we rely on on are very incomplete and we rely on on are very incomplete and we rely on on commercial feeds that we combine all commercial feeds that we combine all commercial feeds that we combine all commercial feeds together because one commercial feeds together because one commercial feeds together because one provides this, one provides that and provides this, one provides that and provides this, one provides that and that's the only way how we get the the that's the only way how we get the the that's the only way how we get the the complete information what we need. Okay. complete information what we need. Okay. complete information what we need. Okay. So a lot of different feeds. So you're So a lot of different feeds. So you're So a lot of different feeds. So you're relying on the and many of the relying on the and many of the relying on the and many of the commercial feeds, not the one that are commercial feeds, not the one that are commercial feeds, not the one that are but you're you're relying to do that but you're you're relying to do that but you're you're relying to do that yourself or the security vendor to do yourself or the security vendor to do yourself or the security vendor to do that do that for you. So we have well if that do that for you. So we have well if that do that for you. So we have well if we call commercial feed the security we call commercial feed the security we call commercial feed the security vendor. Okay. That's why I want to make vendor. Okay. That's why I want to make vendor. Okay. That's why I want to make sure. Okay Christina sure. Okay Christina sure. Okay Christina I am okay if they open source their I am okay if they open source their I am okay if they open source their security advisories like GitHub security security advisories like GitHub security security advisories like GitHub security advisories. Great. or if you know SIFT advisories. Great. or if you know SIFT advisories. Great. or if you know SIFT wants to open source adding metadata to wants to open source adding metadata to wants to open source adding metadata to NVD records. I am very much not cool NVD records. I am very much not cool NVD records. I am very much not cool with a closed source like black duct with a closed source like black duct with a closed source like black duct security advisories, right? Why are they security advisories, right? Why are they security advisories, right? Why are they adding all this metadata that you have adding all this metadata that you have adding all this metadata that you have to that's all behind a payw wall, you to that's all behind a payw wall, you to that's all behind a payw wall, you know, so you have to pay to get access know, so you have to pay to get access know, so you have to pay to get access to their security advisories that, you to their security advisories that, you to their security advisories that, you know, only they know about and they're know, only they know about and they're know, only they know about and they're not going to tell anyone. It's secret sauce. So, I just wanted to spend a sauce. So, I just wanted to spend a sauce. So, I just wanted to spend a couple minutes talking about our couple minutes talking about our couple minutes talking about our experience. Um my colleague Wiweek and I experience. Um my colleague Wiweek and I experience. Um my colleague Wiweek and I have been working on this for over a have been working on this for over a have been working on this for over a year and and uh we have decided to go year and and uh we have decided to go year and and uh we have decided to go with VEX inside of CESAF right so we with VEX inside of CESAF right so we with VEX inside of CESAF right so we spent a lot of time developing a a spent a lot of time developing a a spent a lot of time developing a a publishing tool that would take our our publishing tool that would take our our publishing tool that would take our our first party CVE information and publish first party CVE information and publish first party CVE information and publish it in CESAP files and we started it in CESAP files and we started it in CESAP files and we started publishing those in November and and publishing those in November and and publishing those in November and and then we did that in on the way to VEX then we did that in on the way to VEX then we did that in on the way to VEX right because We want to publish VEX right because We want to publish VEX right because We want to publish VEX inside of inside of inside of CESAF and it's a much bigger thing when CESAF and it's a much bigger thing when CESAF and it's a much bigger thing when you're talking about all the third party you're talking about all the third party you're talking about all the third party vulnerabilities that are in all the open vulnerabilities that are in all the open vulnerabilities that are in all the open source that it is in every Microsoft source that it is in every Microsoft source that it is in every Microsoft product and but the fact is that product and but the fact is that product and but the fact is that engineering teams are dealing with this engineering teams are dealing with this engineering teams are dealing with this issue they are aware that we we have issue they are aware that we we have issue they are aware that we we have tools that make them aware of third tools that make them aware of third tools that make them aware of third party CVEes and they are asked to think party CVEes and they are asked to think party CVEes and they are asked to think about it and they think about it and about it and they think about it and about it and they think about it and they adjust to it in one way or another. they adjust to it in one way or another. they adjust to it in one way or another. It's just not formalized. It's not like It's just not formalized. It's not like It's just not formalized. It's not like we're not doing anything about it. We we're not doing anything about it. We we're not doing anything about it. We are aware that using open source is are aware that using open source is are aware that using open source is difficult and challenging and scary and difficult and challenging and scary and difficult and challenging and scary and dangerous dangerous dangerous potentially. So, we have thought about potentially. So, we have thought about potentially. So, we have thought about it. We just haven't formalized it. And it. We just haven't formalized it. And it. We just haven't formalized it. And so the trick is going to be to to so the trick is going to be to to so the trick is going to be to to formalize it through a VEX attestation formalize it through a VEX attestation formalize it through a VEX attestation that we can that we can that we can publicly you know uh publicly you know uh publicly you know uh publish. And so we've ch we've decided publish. And so we've ch we've decided publish. And so we've ch we've decided to start very small with one product and to start very small with one product and to start very small with one product and one team that's already dealing with one team that's already dealing with one team that's already dealing with this in a very formal way. Our Azure this in a very formal way. Our Azure this in a very formal way. Our Azure Linux DRO. We're already publishing all Linux DRO. We're already publishing all Linux DRO. We're already publishing all the thirdparty CBEEs that go into that the thirdparty CBEEs that go into that the thirdparty CBEEs that go into that Azure Linux DRO. We're just not doing it Azure Linux DRO. We're just not doing it Azure Linux DRO. We're just not doing it through VEX. Um, so that data they I through VEX. Um, so that data they I through VEX. Um, so that data they I think they still do an oval file, but think they still do an oval file, but think they still do an oval file, but they're also publishing it through the they're also publishing it through the they're also publishing it through the security update guide API, but they're security update guide API, but they're security update guide API, but they're not doing a very good job of it. And so not doing a very good job of it. And so not doing a very good job of it. And so we're working with that team to we're working with that team to we're working with that team to formalize that and publish vex formalize that and publish vex formalize that and publish vex statements. So we have our security.ext statements. So we have our security.ext statements. So we have our security.ext file, which is going right now points to file, which is going right now points to file, which is going right now points to our CESAP directory. It will point to a our CESAP directory. It will point to a our CESAP directory. It will point to a VEX directory which is parallel just VEX directory which is parallel just VEX directory which is parallel just like Red Hat's doing. And like Red Hat's doing. And like Red Hat's doing. And potentially we'll have a vex file for potentially we'll have a vex file for potentially we'll have a vex file for every one of the 250,000 every one of the 250,000 every one of the 250,000 CVEes where in this case Azure Linux CVEes where in this case Azure Linux CVEes where in this case Azure Linux plugs in their attestations which right plugs in their attestations which right plugs in their attestations which right now are mostly fixed not um not affected now are mostly fixed not um not affected now are mostly fixed not um not affected right because so far we've only been right because so far we've only been right because so far we've only been doing fixed because we only we don't doing fixed because we only we don't doing fixed because we only we don't talk about the notaffected ones but talk about the notaffected ones but talk about the notaffected ones but that's you know that's the next step for that's you know that's the next step for that's you know that's the next step for those guys to talk about those that are those guys to talk about those that are those guys to talk about those that are not affected so you can attest so the not affected so you can attest so the not affected so you can attest so the red flags from a scanning vendor will go red flags from a scanning vendor will go red flags from a scanning vendor will go away and then the trick is to get to the away and then the trick is to get to the away and then the trick is to get to the rest of the company the rest of rest of the company the rest of rest of the company the rest of Microsoft and so we're working with that Microsoft and so we're working with that Microsoft and so we're working with that the there is a engine a build system the there is a engine a build system the there is a engine a build system that everybody's supposed to use of that everybody's supposed to use of that everybody's supposed to use of course Windows and office don't use it course Windows and office don't use it course Windows and office don't use it but a lot of a lot of the engineering but a lot of a lot of the engineering but a lot of a lot of the engineering teams do use it so we're going to try to teams do use it so we're going to try to teams do use it so we're going to try to link in and attestation tool at that link in and attestation tool at that link in and attestation tool at that level. So when they're so it's going to level. So when they're so it's going to level. So when they're so it's going to be a barrier to the build, right? So be a barrier to the build, right? So be a barrier to the build, right? So they're going to have to do some work they're going to have to do some work they're going to have to do some work and make the attestment to either it's and make the attestment to either it's and make the attestment to either it's not affected and tell me why or it is not affected and tell me why or it is not affected and tell me why or it is affected and here's the fix. And so it's affected and here's the fix. And so it's affected and here's the fix. And so it's a long process and it's g it's going to a long process and it's g it's going to a long process and it's g it's going to take more much more time for us to do take more much more time for us to do take more much more time for us to do that. But but we're sort of crawl walk. that. But but we're sort of crawl walk. that. But but we're sort of crawl walk. We're we're prec crawl at this point, We're we're prec crawl at this point, We're we're prec crawl at this point, right? But we have got the cesaf files right? But we have got the cesaf files right? But we have got the cesaf files out there. So So that's kind of how out there. So So that's kind of how out there. So So that's kind of how we're going about it, but I'd be we're going about it, but I'd be we're going about it, but I'd be interesting to see if others are interesting to see if others are interesting to see if others are thinking about cesafex or open vex or or thinking about cesafex or open vex or or thinking about cesafex or open vex or or something else. something else. something else. I also want to hear from another I also want to hear from another I also want to hear from another customer segment. Uh thoughts on that. customer segment. Uh thoughts on that. customer segment. Uh thoughts on that. So, so I think we moved on to a So, so I think we moved on to a So, so I think we moved on to a different topic, but I think your different topic, but I think your different topic, but I think your question was um if if we as customers if question was um if if we as customers if question was um if if we as customers if we're happy with security vendors we're happy with security vendors we're happy with security vendors providing their own evaluation and um providing their own evaluation and um providing their own evaluation and um it's not ideal, right? But we so we use it's not ideal, right? But we so we use it's not ideal, right? But we so we use several security scanners and um they several security scanners and um they several security scanners and um they they all do they they have their own they all do they they have their own they all do they they have their own methodologies, right? And they all of methodologies, right? And they all of methodologies, right? And they all of them use NVD, right? them use NVD, right? them use NVD, right? But some of them some of them take NVD But some of them some of them take NVD But some of them some of them take NVD CSS score right if for example if NVD CSS score right if for example if NVD CSS score right if for example if NVD score is present they take it if NVD is score is present they take it if NVD is score is present they take it if NVD is not present then they they will take CNA not present then they they will take CNA not present then they they will take CNA score. Um if neither is present they score. Um if neither is present they score. Um if neither is present they will evaluate themselves but they will will evaluate themselves but they will will evaluate themselves but they will provide they will provide the CVSS provide they will provide the CVSS provide they will provide the CVSS vector. vector. vector. um based on my experience with certain um based on my experience with certain um based on my experience with certain vendors, there are vendors I can trust vendors, there are vendors I can trust vendors, there are vendors I can trust because over many years I kind of see because over many years I kind of see because over many years I kind of see where they're going with their analysis where they're going with their analysis where they're going with their analysis and I can trust them. There are vendors and I can trust them. There are vendors and I can trust them. There are vendors who will provide the severity if if if who will provide the severity if if if who will provide the severity if if if not if if neither NVD or CNA uh sports not if if neither NVD or CNA uh sports not if if neither NVD or CNA uh sports are present, they will provide the are present, they will provide the are present, they will provide the severity but not the CVSS vector, right? severity but not the CVSS vector, right? severity but not the CVSS vector, right? And that's these these cases it's really And that's these these cases it's really And that's these these cases it's really hard to trust them because how did they hard to trust them because how did they hard to trust them because how did they come to this conclusion, right? So it come to this conclusion, right? So it come to this conclusion, right? So it depends. Uh ideally of course there depends. Uh ideally of course there depends. Uh ideally of course there would be a complete system that's would be a complete system that's would be a complete system that's centralized that all the security centralized that all the security centralized that all the security vendors could use that we could rely on vendors could use that we could rely on vendors could use that we could rely on but that's not the case. So we're just but that's not the case. So we're just but that's not the case. So we're just dealing with the dealing with the dealing with the realities. So what I heard is that you realities. So what I heard is that you realities. So what I heard is that you use uh security vendor um they normally use uh security vendor um they normally use uh security vendor um they normally pull from uh MVD or another source like pull from uh MVD or another source like pull from uh MVD or another source like that when not they go to uh the that when not they go to uh the that when not they go to uh the originator I'll call the CNA. Um and originator I'll call the CNA. Um and originator I'll call the CNA. Um and then your question is do you trust and then your question is do you trust and then your question is do you trust and trust was a very big comment in the trust was a very big comment in the trust was a very big comment in the middle of that. Um and I think there in middle of that. Um and I think there in middle of that. Um and I think there in lies a challenge for us about VEX is we lies a challenge for us about VEX is we lies a challenge for us about VEX is we have to make sure that we have a have to make sure that we have a have to make sure that we have a standard way of approaching it and a standard way of approaching it and a standard way of approaching it and a delivery system that actually informs in some ways it's how do we informs in some ways it's how do we informs in some ways it's how do we become more as producers open about what become more as producers open about what become more as producers open about what it is that's affecting us. Now we have it is that's affecting us. Now we have it is that's affecting us. Now we have different timelines, okay? Microsoft and different timelines, okay? Microsoft and different timelines, okay? Microsoft and Red Hat do it differently uh about our Red Hat do it differently uh about our Red Hat do it differently uh about our CVE announcements, but when you do get CVE announcements, but when you do get CVE announcements, but when you do get that information, it's knowing what that that information, it's knowing what that that information, it's knowing what that state is across that portfolio that state is across that portfolio that state is across that portfolio that you're you're looking for. And then it's you're you're looking for. And then it's you're you're looking for. And then it's a matter of how you can trust it. So a matter of how you can trust it. So a matter of how you can trust it. So there's a timing issue and there's a a there's a timing issue and there's a a there's a timing issue and there's a a trust issue that's involved in that. trust issue that's involved in that. trust issue that's involved in that. Um I was going to try to get one of my Um I was going to try to get one of my Um I was going to try to get one of my guys to talk on this. I think he kind of guys to talk on this. I think he kind of guys to talk on this. I think he kind of punted back to me. Well, Pete, we punted back to me. Well, Pete, we punted back to me. Well, Pete, we actually have a comment online. If I can actually have a comment online. If I can actually have a comment online. If I can read that. So, it says, "Our biggest read that. So, it says, "Our biggest read that. So, it says, "Our biggest challenge is resources always. Our challenge is resources always. Our challenge is resources always. Our second biggest challenge is producing second biggest challenge is producing second biggest challenge is producing VEX is distribution. The expectation is VEX is distribution. The expectation is VEX is distribution. The expectation is that some end customers governments will that some end customers governments will that some end customers governments will call VEX a testing that we're aware of call VEX a testing that we're aware of call VEX a testing that we're aware of essentially all CBEEs, including all the essentially all CBEEs, including all the essentially all CBEEs, including all the CBEs that we're not vulnerable to for CBEs that we're not vulnerable to for CBEs that we're not vulnerable to for all versions of all products within all versions of all products within all versions of all products within hours of it hours of it hours of it appearing. What do you think about that? appearing. What do you think about that? appearing. What do you think about that? unfair advantage for me. Okay. Uh number unfair advantage for me. Okay. Uh number unfair advantage for me. Okay. Uh number one, um uh I pushed real hard that we'd one, um uh I pushed real hard that we'd one, um uh I pushed real hard that we'd uh publish unaffected CBES. Um we took a uh publish unaffected CBES. Um we took a uh publish unaffected CBES. Um we took a while to get to that point and and we're while to get to that point and and we're while to get to that point and and we're doing it now and we're going back in the doing it now and we're going back in the doing it now and we're going back in the entire uh corpus, which is not a simple entire uh corpus, which is not a simple entire uh corpus, which is not a simple uh easy thing. You want to find out how uh easy thing. You want to find out how uh easy thing. You want to find out how your web team really uh your web portal your web team really uh your web portal your web team really uh your web portal team thinks of you, uh try pushing a lot team thinks of you, uh try pushing a lot team thinks of you, uh try pushing a lot of data. Um so we we did that. Um the of data. Um so we we did that. Um the of data. Um so we we did that. Um the challenge for most of us is going to be challenge for most of us is going to be challenge for most of us is going to be when we do find its uh uh affecting us when we do find its uh uh affecting us when we do find its uh uh affecting us because of some future issue. Um do we because of some future issue. Um do we because of some future issue. Um do we need to bring it back? Uh that that's a need to bring it back? Uh that that's a need to bring it back? Uh that that's a that's a process problem for us that's a process problem for us that's a process problem for us internally. Um I forgot the rest of the internally. Um I forgot the rest of the internally. Um I forgot the rest of the question. What was the rest of the question. What was the rest of the question. What was the rest of the question? question? question? Context. Context. Context. Yeah. So Yeah. So Yeah. So it let's call it for what it is. We have it let's call it for what it is. We have it let's call it for what it is. We have a data challenge here. And when you have a data challenge here. And when you have a data challenge here. And when you have the data, it's a matter of how do you the data, it's a matter of how do you the data, it's a matter of how do you convey a way that's convey a way that's convey a way that's useful. The customer doesn't want to useful. The customer doesn't want to useful. The customer doesn't want to waste time researching that issue in waste time researching that issue in waste time researching that issue in great detail. They're looking for am I great detail. They're looking for am I great detail. They're looking for am I affected or not? What's my current affected or not? What's my current affected or not? What's my current state? And it's something that I think state? And it's something that I think state? And it's something that I think technology has driven us to the point technology has driven us to the point technology has driven us to the point that they're looking for an answer that they're looking for an answer that they're looking for an answer fairly fairly fairly quick and they're accepting that the quick and they're accepting that the quick and they're accepting that the answer can answer can answer can change, you know, and so how do you change, you know, and so how do you change, you know, and so how do you deliver that and it comes down to an deliver that and it comes down to an deliver that and it comes down to an automation part? I think the challenge automation part? I think the challenge automation part? I think the challenge we're going to run we're going to run we're going to run into is people being able to read it on into is people being able to read it on into is people being able to read it on their their their own. And to be honest about it, I think own. And to be honest about it, I think own. And to be honest about it, I think we need to get some robust uh VEX we need to get some robust uh VEX we need to get some robust uh VEX readers out there that we all have readers out there that we all have readers out there that we all have contributed to because once we do that, contributed to because once we do that, contributed to because once we do that, we can go forward on. Now, I I say the we can go forward on. Now, I I say the we can go forward on. Now, I I say the robust because my boss has actually robust because my boss has actually robust because my boss has actually written one and he's sitting in the back written one and he's sitting in the back written one and he's sitting in the back so I have to acknowledge that uh and we so I have to acknowledge that uh and we so I have to acknowledge that uh and we can give you the link for that. But how can give you the link for that. But how can give you the link for that. But how do we make it robust so that a customer, do we make it robust so that a customer, do we make it robust so that a customer, a security vendor can take on a lot of a security vendor can take on a lot of a security vendor can take on a lot of uh VEX and then appropriately search it? uh VEX and then appropriately search it? uh VEX and then appropriately search it? And that's that's something that we have And that's that's something that we have And that's that's something that we have to kind of look at collectively. I could to kind of look at collectively. I could to kind of look at collectively. I could Red Hat do it? Well, my boss wanted to Red Hat do it? Well, my boss wanted to Red Hat do it? Well, my boss wanted to dedicate more time and and assets. He dedicate more time and and assets. He dedicate more time and and assets. He probably could uh get us to do it. Um probably could uh get us to do it. Um probably could uh get us to do it. Um but is this really a community problem but is this really a community problem but is this really a community problem is what we would rather look is what we would rather look is what we would rather look at because behind all this for those of at because behind all this for those of at because behind all this for those of us produce we have a different uh us produce we have a different uh us produce we have a different uh problem of how do we gather this problem of how do we gather this problem of how do we gather this information and tool it so we can information and tool it so we can information and tool it so we can actually deliver it uh and I think that actually deliver it uh and I think that actually deliver it uh and I think that should be more open sourced and and uh should be more open sourced and and uh should be more open sourced and and uh and looked at so we can deliver like and looked at so we can deliver like and looked at so we can deliver like it's the like part that is going to make it's the like part that is going to make it's the like part that is going to make it work. Go ahead, Megazone. I'm going it work. Go ahead, Megazone. I'm going it work. Go ahead, Megazone. I'm going have to softball a lot at you because I have to softball a lot at you because I have to softball a lot at you because I know we had this conversation on the know we had this conversation on the know we had this conversation on the sidelines already. The problem with VEX sidelines already. The problem with VEX sidelines already. The problem with VEX is there is no such thing as VEX. There is there is no such thing as VEX. There is there is no such thing as VEX. There are a lot of things that are all called are a lot of things that are all called are a lot of things that are all called VEX. Uh we have OpenVEX and CESAF and VEX. Uh we have OpenVEX and CESAF and VEX. Uh we have OpenVEX and CESAF and several other formats. And so like you several other formats. And so like you several other formats. And so like you said, robot readers and such. You know, said, robot readers and such. You know, said, robot readers and such. You know, I know we're looking at doing CESAP as I I know we're looking at doing CESAP as I I know we're looking at doing CESAP as I know Microsoft and Red Hat are both know Microsoft and Red Hat are both know Microsoft and Red Hat are both doing CAEs VEX, but I think part of the doing CAEs VEX, but I think part of the doing CAEs VEX, but I think part of the industry problem right now with VEX is industry problem right now with VEX is industry problem right now with VEX is there is this too many standards to there is this too many standards to there is this too many standards to choose from. And so you create a reader. choose from. And so you create a reader. choose from. And so you create a reader. Are you is that reader going to parse Are you is that reader going to parse Are you is that reader going to parse every possible VEX format? Are we going every possible VEX format? Are we going every possible VEX format? Are we going to try to push people to do, you know, to try to push people to do, you know, to try to push people to do, you know, all agree on one, maybe two or all agree on one, maybe two or all agree on one, maybe two or something? something? something? It's a good question. Um, I don't think It's a good question. Um, I don't think It's a good question. Um, I don't think we can do all because all is infinite. we can do all because all is infinite. we can do all because all is infinite. uh do we do the one or two? You know, uh do we do the one or two? You know, uh do we do the one or two? You know, you got to start with something, but how you got to start with something, but how you got to start with something, but how far do we want to go? I I'll leave that far do we want to go? I I'll leave that far do we want to go? I I'll leave that as an open question. You're exactly as an open question. You're exactly as an open question. You're exactly right in that uh Martin and my team is right in that uh Martin and my team is right in that uh Martin and my team is uh when I mentioned it to him, he says uh when I mentioned it to him, he says uh when I mentioned it to him, he says it's not a it's not a it's not a standard. It's what was your word? standard. It's what was your word? standard. It's what was your word? Nebulous. It's a concept. So how do I Nebulous. It's a concept. So how do I Nebulous. It's a concept. So how do I think the seesaf format and he can uh he think the seesaf format and he can uh he think the seesaf format and he can uh he will correct me uh not he may he will will correct me uh not he may he will will correct me uh not he may he will um the seesaf puts some uh frame to it um the seesaf puts some uh frame to it um the seesaf puts some uh frame to it to deliver on that concept. The concept to deliver on that concept. The concept to deliver on that concept. The concept is can we talk about the exploitability is can we talk about the exploitability is can we talk about the exploitability or the effectiveness of a CBE Thomas? CBE Thomas? CBE Thomas? Yeah. um when I heard this can kind of Yeah. um when I heard this can kind of Yeah. um when I heard this can kind of basically it falls down for me for kind basically it falls down for me for kind basically it falls down for me for kind of not only the common language and the of not only the common language and the of not only the common language and the common vex standard but for me it's also common vex standard but for me it's also common vex standard but for me it's also the ADP discussion on how can we the ADP discussion on how can we the ADP discussion on how can we basically um contribute to that same basically um contribute to that same basically um contribute to that same data source because uh the much that I data source because uh the much that I data source because uh the much that I like that federated approach and the like that federated approach and the like that federated approach and the much that I like CESF and us having the much that I like CESF and us having the much that I like CESF and us having the possibility to um basically upload those possibility to um basically upload those possibility to um basically upload those files to a web server um parts of the files to a web server um parts of the files to a web server um parts of the session is also how do we ingest that session is also how do we ingest that session is also how do we ingest that into the vulnerability vendors data into the vulnerability vendors data into the vulnerability vendors data sources and they will not read thousands sources and they will not read thousands sources and they will not read thousands of data sources So from my perspective of data sources So from my perspective of data sources So from my perspective it's then even an integration of how do it's then even an integration of how do it's then even an integration of how do we integrate no how do you as a CVE we integrate no how do you as a CVE we integrate no how do you as a CVE board integrate vex into uh the ADP uh board integrate vex into uh the ADP uh board integrate vex into uh the ADP uh part of the CVE thing. So basically from part of the CVE thing. So basically from part of the CVE thing. So basically from my perspective that all connects somehow my perspective that all connects somehow my perspective that all connects somehow together and then basically even also together and then basically even also together and then basically even also the tooling that we create to consume the tooling that we create to consume the tooling that we create to consume the data or provide and consume the data. Before I screw it up, I'm g a I think I Before I screw it up, I'm g a I think I Before I screw it up, I'm g a I think I I think the CV v5 schema already kind of I think the CV v5 schema already kind of I think the CV v5 schema already kind of supports VEX. You can identify supports VEX. You can identify supports VEX. You can identify components, you can identify ranges, you components, you can identify ranges, you components, you can identify ranges, you can tell which ones are vulnerable, can tell which ones are vulnerable, can tell which ones are vulnerable, which ones aren't, and that's VEX, which ones aren't, and that's VEX, which ones aren't, and that's VEX, right? The only thing that is missing is right? The only thing that is missing is right? The only thing that is missing is the justifications, right? That's the the justifications, right? That's the the justifications, right? That's the like special sauce in VEX is that for like special sauce in VEX is that for like special sauce in VEX is that for every statement that says not affected, every statement that says not affected, every statement that says not affected, you have to specify why it's not you have to specify why it's not you have to specify why it's not affected and it gives you like one of affected and it gives you like one of affected and it gives you like one of those five stock statements, right? Like those five stock statements, right? Like those five stock statements, right? Like inline mitigations or component not inline mitigations or component not inline mitigations or component not present, right? Yeah. That's the only present, right? Yeah. That's the only present, right? Yeah. That's the only part that's missing from CV5. part that's missing from CV5. part that's missing from CV5. Yeah. But Martin, I I I don't quite Yeah. But Martin, I I I don't quite Yeah. But Martin, I I I don't quite understand you in this aspect because me understand you in this aspect because me understand you in this aspect because me as a CNA can't put anything into a third as a CNA can't put anything into a third as a CNA can't put anything into a third party CVE record in JSON 5. But you party CVE record in JSON 5. But you party CVE record in JSON 5. But you should be able to through ADPs, right? should be able to through ADPs, right? should be able to through ADPs, right? You should be able to. Okay. So, you're You should be able to. Okay. So, you're You should be able to. Okay. So, you're suggesting that we solve VEX with CVE suggesting that we solve VEX with CVE suggesting that we solve VEX with CVE using ADPs. Yeah, why not? using ADPs. Yeah, why not? using ADPs. Yeah, why not? every C every CNA should become an ADP every C every CNA should become an ADP every C every CNA should become an ADP and then like if if OpenSSL acting as a and then like if if OpenSSL acting as a and then like if if OpenSSL acting as a CNA releases a CVE and you know shows CNA releases a CVE and you know shows CNA releases a CVE and you know shows the effectiveness of upstream OpenSSL the effectiveness of upstream OpenSSL the effectiveness of upstream OpenSSL there should be five ADP containers one there should be five ADP containers one there should be five ADP containers one from Fedora one from re one from Debian from Fedora one from re one from Debian from Fedora one from re one from Debian one from Ubuntu one from Azure Linux one from Ubuntu one from Azure Linux one from Ubuntu one from Azure Linux claiming the effectiveness of their claiming the effectiveness of their claiming the effectiveness of their downstream open SSL however it's downstream open SSL however it's downstream open SSL however it's distributed RPM and Fedora RPM and re distributed RPM and Fedora RPM and re distributed RPM and Fedora RPM and re Debian package and Debian in right and Debian package and Debian in right and Debian package and Debian in right and each have their own statement am I each have their own statement am I each have their own statement am I affected or not because it could be that affected or not because it could be that affected or not because it could be that they're not right because of the way they're not right because of the way they're not right because of the way they package the OpenSSL upstream code they package the OpenSSL upstream code they package the OpenSSL upstream code interesting and um yeah most of you know interesting and um yeah most of you know interesting and um yeah most of you know what I think about VEX but this allows what I think about VEX but this allows what I think about VEX but this allows me to basically add also specific me to basically add also specific me to basically add also specific scenarios so component specific CVSS to scenarios so component specific CVSS to scenarios so component specific CVSS to that so basically to the question of that so basically to the question of that so basically to the question of which standard do we use we already have which standard do we use we already have which standard do we use we already have it I here it I here it I here yeah you don't you don't need a standard yeah you don't you don't need a standard yeah you don't you don't need a standard technically Right. technically Right. technically Right. I was just going to say I've mention I I was just going to say I've mention I I was just going to say I've mention I mentioned this to Pete. He's chuckling mentioned this to Pete. He's chuckling mentioned this to Pete. He's chuckling because he already knows. CV.org should because he already knows. CV.org should because he already knows. CV.org should be the single source of truth and any be the single source of truth and any be the single source of truth and any vendor of a piece of software should be vendor of a piece of software should be vendor of a piece of software should be able to push vulnerability information able to push vulnerability information able to push vulnerability information to to to CV.org. CV.org does not rate any CV.org. CV.org does not rate any CV.org. CV.org does not rate any vulnerabilities. No severity rating, no vulnerabilities. No severity rating, no vulnerabilities. No severity rating, no CBSS score, completely agnostic. It's a CBSS score, completely agnostic. It's a CBSS score, completely agnostic. It's a container for every single vendor that container for every single vendor that container for every single vendor that ships a piece of whatever OpenSSL as an ships a piece of whatever OpenSSL as an ships a piece of whatever OpenSSL as an example. You're going to have a hundred example. You're going to have a hundred example. You're going to have a hundred different CVSs scores, severity ratings, different CVSs scores, severity ratings, different CVSs scores, severity ratings, etc. by vendor, by product on that one etc. by vendor, by product on that one etc. by vendor, by product on that one page. And every single scanner just has page. And every single scanner just has page. And every single scanner just has to go one place to get everything for to go one place to get everything for to go one place to get everything for everything that they're scanning for everything that they're scanning for everything that they're scanning for done. Solved. We don't have to do done. Solved. We don't have to do done. Solved. We don't have to do consume from a thousand different consume from a thousand different consume from a thousand different vendors. You go to one place. You get it vendors. You go to one place. You get it vendors. You go to one place. You get it all. The responsibility is on the vendor all. The responsibility is on the vendor all. The responsibility is on the vendor to push there. It just has to be that to push there. It just has to be that to push there. It just has to be that platform that disseminates that platform that disseminates that platform that disseminates that information in a completely vendor information in a completely vendor information in a completely vendor agnostic way and maybe maybe just a comment on way and maybe maybe just a comment on way and maybe maybe just a comment on that one. Um so from a that one. Um so from a that one. Um so from a uh this uh data perspective I like that uh this uh data perspective I like that uh this uh data perspective I like that but kind of with that comes also great but kind of with that comes also great but kind of with that comes also great responsibilities on kind of responsibilities on kind of responsibilities on kind of searchability kind of which product searchability kind of which product searchability kind of which product which CV and I think the data structures which CV and I think the data structures which CV and I think the data structures that currently are used and kind of the that currently are used and kind of the that currently are used and kind of the distribution methods with with git and distribution methods with with git and distribution methods with with git and all that are definitely not ready to all that are definitely not ready to all that are definitely not ready to have that. So basically the tool have that. So basically the tool have that. So basically the tool development and kind of how those things development and kind of how those things development and kind of how those things are modeled and basically maybe we also are modeled and basically maybe we also are modeled and basically maybe we also need a database and all that behind. So need a database and all that behind. So need a database and all that behind. So that's a lot of work. I'm just I'm not that's a lot of work. I'm just I'm not that's a lot of work. I'm just I'm not here to say like I want that now. So, I here to say like I want that now. So, I here to say like I want that now. So, I want that now. Yes. But I'm seeing that want that now. Yes. But I'm seeing that want that now. Yes. But I'm seeing that it's hard work for us as the community it's hard work for us as the community it's hard work for us as the community to actually make it happen. Uh, thank to actually make it happen. Uh, thank to actually make it happen. Uh, thank you for that community word because you for that community word because you for that community word because that's what I'm looking for. I just I that's what I'm looking for. I just I that's what I'm looking for. I just I just want to make an aside about that. I just want to make an aside about that. I just want to make an aside about that. I love that idea. That's great. You do love that idea. That's great. You do love that idea. That's great. You do have a slight bit of a funding problem. have a slight bit of a funding problem. have a slight bit of a funding problem. So, our sbomb management platform is So, our sbomb management platform is So, our sbomb management platform is already 200 gigabytes and that's just already 200 gigabytes and that's just already 200 gigabytes and that's just for components and CVEes and we're just for components and CVEes and we're just for components and CVEes and we're just Cisco. You're you're talking about a Cisco. You're you're talking about a Cisco. You're you're talking about a database that's upwards of two terabytes database that's upwards of two terabytes database that's upwards of two terabytes or more. You're boiling the ocean. You or more. You're boiling the ocean. You or more. You're boiling the ocean. You really are. All connections between all really are. All connections between all really are. All connections between all software ever. It's a great It's like a software ever. It's a great It's like a software ever. It's a great It's like a pie in the sky idea. I love it. But uh the short answer is yes. But imagine uh the short answer is yes. But imagine uh the short answer is yes. But imagine a world where funding that went to a a world where funding that went to a a world where funding that went to a number of different, this might get me number of different, this might get me number of different, this might get me in trouble, different places such as the in trouble, different places such as the in trouble, different places such as the NVD, such as what Anise is planning to NVD, such as what Anise is planning to NVD, such as what Anise is planning to create, like money is being poured into create, like money is being poured into create, like money is being poured into all of these competing alternative all of these competing alternative all of these competing alternative solutions that will continue to keep solutions that will continue to keep solutions that will continue to keep this ecosystem fragmented. If we could this ecosystem fragmented. If we could this ecosystem fragmented. If we could all collectically get our heads into the all collectically get our heads into the all collectically get our heads into the game and actually fund this thing, game and actually fund this thing, game and actually fund this thing, whether it's governments, vendors, etc. whether it's governments, vendors, etc. whether it's governments, vendors, etc. Set up CV.org is a properly funded Set up CV.org is a properly funded Set up CV.org is a properly funded foundation to run this thing properly foundation to run this thing properly foundation to run this thing properly and solve the problem once and for all. and solve the problem once and for all. and solve the problem once and for all. I have no idea what that looks like. I I have no idea what that looks like. I I have no idea what that looks like. I have no idea what it's going to take, have no idea what it's going to take, have no idea what it's going to take, but I think some anything short of that but I think some anything short of that but I think some anything short of that is just perpetuating the problem. In 10 is just perpetuating the problem. In 10 is just perpetuating the problem. In 10 years, we'll be back here again going years, we'll be back here again going years, we'll be back here again going what's the next solution? Because all what's the next solution? Because all what's the next solution? Because all the stuff we've been doing for the last the stuff we've been doing for the last the stuff we've been doing for the last 10 years isn't working because all the 10 years isn't working because all the 10 years isn't working because all the stuff we've been doing for the last 10 stuff we've been doing for the last 10 stuff we've been doing for the last 10 years isn't working. Wow. H how do you follow that one up? Uh Wow. H how do you follow that one up? Uh Wow. H how do you follow that one up? Uh because first of all, the last four because first of all, the last four because first of all, the last four commenters were commenters were commenters were uh well verssed in the problem and where uh well verssed in the problem and where uh well verssed in the problem and where is the is the is the challenge? So the question I would turn challenge? So the question I would turn challenge? So the question I would turn to is uh for those who aren't a to is uh for those who aren't a to is uh for those who aren't a producer, what do you producer, what do you producer, what do you think? I see a nod, a thumbs up. Okay. think? I see a nod, a thumbs up. Okay. think? I see a nod, a thumbs up. Okay. How about for you How about for you How about for you guys? guys? guys? Yeah. I'm sure you don't know my English Yeah. I'm sure you don't know my English Yeah. I'm sure you don't know my English very well, but yes. Do you like the the very well, but yes. Do you like the the very well, but yes. Do you like the the approach? You would. Okay. So the spreading of the would. Okay. So the spreading of the would. Okay. So the spreading of the information around dozens of places is information around dozens of places is information around dozens of places is your nightmare and you're looking for your nightmare and you're looking for your nightmare and you're looking for how can you collate it and I would how can you collate it and I would how can you collate it and I would assume that that whole question would be assume that that whole question would be assume that that whole question would be can I look at the same way so I can can I look at the same way so I can can I look at the same way so I can compare one item to the compare one item to the compare one item to the next. Okay. So I I think that kind of next. Okay. So I I think that kind of next. Okay. So I I think that kind of says the problem statement. The question says the problem statement. The question says the problem statement. The question what I'm hearing is if we were to what I'm hearing is if we were to what I'm hearing is if we were to collectively work at that, we're all collectively work at that, we're all collectively work at that, we're all willing to take a bite at that apple to willing to take a bite at that apple to willing to take a bite at that apple to help uh chew on it, I guess. Go ahead, Thomas. You add on that kind of looking Thomas. You add on that kind of looking Thomas. You add on that kind of looking at our internal numbers on how many at our internal numbers on how many at our internal numbers on how many internal vulnerability notifications we internal vulnerability notifications we internal vulnerability notifications we send to product teams and get those send to product teams and get those send to product teams and get those respective answers. That is a high load respective answers. That is a high load respective answers. That is a high load amount. You already said that from the amount. You already said that from the amount. You already said that from the data source, but also kind of from a data source, but also kind of from a data source, but also kind of from a security scanner point of view kind of security scanner point of view kind of security scanner point of view kind of it's also very hard to find the right it's also very hard to find the right it's also very hard to find the right piece of information to show it to the piece of information to show it to the piece of information to show it to the customer in that right scenario for that customer in that right scenario for that customer in that right scenario for that asset. So just having the data available asset. So just having the data available asset. So just having the data available is from my perspective only the very is from my perspective only the very is from my perspective only the very very small part of solving the problem. very small part of solving the problem. very small part of solving the problem. But for kind of the the asset scanning But for kind of the the asset scanning But for kind of the the asset scanning and all those sea or whatever tools to and all those sea or whatever tools to and all those sea or whatever tools to find the correct spot of the data that find the correct spot of the data that find the correct spot of the data that you need to show to our mutual customers you need to show to our mutual customers you need to show to our mutual customers will be I think the bigger part of the will be I think the bigger part of the will be I think the bigger part of the problem. So, so as you were talking, the one So, so as you were talking, the one So, so as you were talking, the one thing that struck me that I haven't thing that struck me that I haven't thing that struck me that I haven't thought too, maybe you thought too, maybe you thought too, maybe you have have have feedback. There has to be a way for feedback. There has to be a way for feedback. There has to be a way for quick quick quick feedback because the item was about feedback because the item was about feedback because the item was about trust. And if we can't do the trust trust. And if we can't do the trust trust. And if we can't do the trust aspect aspect aspect uh without some uh without some uh without some feedback, there has to be a way to say I feedback, there has to be a way to say I feedback, there has to be a way to say I think this isn't right. And more think this isn't right. And more think this isn't right. And more importantly, it has to come from those importantly, it has to come from those importantly, it has to come from those who are upstream of us and those who are who are upstream of us and those who are who are upstream of us and those who are researching and reporting uh who are researching and reporting uh who are researching and reporting uh who are going to be the primary feedback going to be the primary feedback going to be the primary feedback mechanisms or I think the system won't mechanisms or I think the system won't mechanisms or I think the system won't work just because of its weight. Isn't work just because of its weight. Isn't work just because of its weight. Isn't that what Twitter X is for? We get all that what Twitter X is for? We get all that what Twitter X is for? We get all sorts of feedback from them. Just don't read it. It doesn't Just don't read it. It doesn't Just don't read it. It doesn't matter. Go ahead. matter. Go ahead. matter. Go ahead. So So So um of course if if all the data is um of course if if all the data is um of course if if all the data is somewhere in a centralized location that somewhere in a centralized location that somewhere in a centralized location that that's great but I think I would prefer that's great but I think I would prefer that's great but I think I would prefer to get it from the security scanner and to get it from the security scanner and to get it from the security scanner and it's because we need to we'd like to get it's because we need to we'd like to get it's because we need to we'd like to get not only VEX data but CV data threat not only VEX data but CV data threat not only VEX data but CV data threat intel. So when it's all aggregated in in intel. So when it's all aggregated in in intel. So when it's all aggregated in in a single source like a security scanner a single source like a security scanner a single source like a security scanner that would be that would be my that would be that would be my that would be that would be my preference. preference. preference. So, I I don't think we're cutting that So, I I don't think we're cutting that So, I I don't think we're cutting that out. But we're just being able to um out. But we're just being able to um out. But we're just being able to um standardize the way we deliver, being standardize the way we deliver, being standardize the way we deliver, being more complete in in that record set that more complete in in that record set that more complete in in that record set that makes it easier for that I'll call that makes it easier for that I'll call that makes it easier for that I'll call that user interface now uh to to uh to parse user interface now uh to to uh to parse user interface now uh to to uh to parse it to your needs, which then would it to your needs, which then would it to your needs, which then would hopefully I would assume as a security hopefully I would assume as a security hopefully I would assume as a security banner security vendor is that they banner security vendor is that they banner security vendor is that they would be able to parse it down to your would be able to parse it down to your would be able to parse it down to your specific needs by product, application, specific needs by product, application, specific needs by product, application, and version. Go ahead, Mark. I was just going to say Go ahead, Mark. I was just going to say Go ahead, Mark. I was just going to say scanners already ingest data from scanners already ingest data from scanners already ingest data from vendors, right? So they already take vendors, right? So they already take vendors, right? So they already take this information this information this information from the NVD, from CV and then add from the NVD, from CV and then add from the NVD, from CV and then add information from vendors because they information from vendors because they information from vendors because they need that information too. So it doesn't need that information too. So it doesn't need that information too. So it doesn't actually change the quality of the data actually change the quality of the data actually change the quality of the data that the scanners produce in any way. that the scanners produce in any way. that the scanners produce in any way. The scanners still need the information The scanners still need the information The scanners still need the information from the vendors, right? So having it from the vendors, right? So having it from the vendors, right? So having it centralized doesn't change that. Well, centralized doesn't change that. Well, centralized doesn't change that. Well, the question is the source of the data. the question is the source of the data. the question is the source of the data. If it's still the vendors that are If it's still the vendors that are If it's still the vendors that are pushing the data to the central pushing the data to the central pushing the data to the central database. Um, okay. So I'm going to push database. Um, okay. So I'm going to push database. Um, okay. So I'm going to push the envelope here. the envelope here. the envelope here. Um, I would say that the data that's Um, I would say that the data that's Um, I would say that the data that's being fed out of MVD does not match what being fed out of MVD does not match what being fed out of MVD does not match what I as a vendor uh saying is affected. So I as a vendor uh saying is affected. So I as a vendor uh saying is affected. So if we're all MVD Yeah. So I I don't I'm if we're all MVD Yeah. So I I don't I'm if we're all MVD Yeah. So I I don't I'm not looking at MVD to transform that not looking at MVD to transform that not looking at MVD to transform that data into something it's not because data into something it's not because data into something it's not because they're doing it from a general they're doing it from a general they're doing it from a general perspective that could affect perspective that could affect perspective that could affect everything. And I think that's the everything. And I think that's the everything. And I think that's the challenge that they've bit off more than challenge that they've bit off more than challenge that they've bit off more than they can chew on that. Um you know they can chew on that. Um you know they can chew on that. Um you know they're not being malicious. They're they're not being malicious. They're they're not being malicious. They're just there's just you know 40,000 CVS just there's just you know 40,000 CVS just there's just you know 40,000 CVS 40,000 CVS. Uh how do you eat that when 40,000 CVS. Uh how do you eat that when 40,000 CVS. Uh how do you eat that when you have a limited budget and you are you have a limited budget and you are you have a limited budget and you are not expert in the software that it's not expert in the software that it's not expert in the software that it's running on? Yeah. Yeah. I was just running on? Yeah. Yeah. I was just running on? Yeah. Yeah. I was just trying to address the c customer's trying to address the c customer's trying to address the c customer's perspective that they trust the perspective that they trust the perspective that they trust the scanner's data. I understand that. But scanner's data. I understand that. But scanner's data. I understand that. But I'm saying the scanner already uses the I'm saying the scanner already uses the I'm saying the scanner already uses the vendor's data anyway because they take vendor's data anyway because they take vendor's data anyway because they take they have to take the vendor's data. I they have to take the vendor's data. I they have to take the vendor's data. I think a couple people want to challenge think a couple people want to challenge think a couple people want to challenge that. Okay. To an extent. Yeah. Uh they that. Okay. To an extent. Yeah. Uh they that. Okay. To an extent. Yeah. Uh they absolutely do not. We've been fighting absolutely do not. We've been fighting absolutely do not. We've been fighting with scanner vendors. They simply do not with scanner vendors. They simply do not with scanner vendors. They simply do not get information from us. Period. Any of get information from us. Period. Any of get information from us. Period. Any of our data. Shouldn't they? They should. our data. Shouldn't they? They should. our data. Shouldn't they? They should. They do not. So that's the problem. They do not. So that's the problem. They do not. So that's the problem. That's one of the things this would help That's one of the things this would help That's one of the things this would help solve is that we we've been fighting to solve is that we we've been fighting to solve is that we we've been fighting to try to get scanner vendors because we try to get scanner vendors because we try to get scanner vendors because we get so many false positives because they get so many false positives because they get so many false positives because they just look and say, "You're running just look and say, "You're running just look and say, "You're running package X version Y. You're vulnerable." package X version Y. You're vulnerable." package X version Y. You're vulnerable." But we're not. And we publish security But we're not. And we publish security But we're not. And we publish security articles that show why we're not. But we articles that show why we're not. But we articles that show why we're not. But we could we get laundry lists from our could we get laundry lists from our could we get laundry lists from our customers because they run a scanner. customers because they run a scanner. customers because they run a scanner. Then they didn't send the whole scanner Then they didn't send the whole scanner Then they didn't send the whole scanner report to us saying, "Explain in detail report to us saying, "Explain in detail report to us saying, "Explain in detail every one of these CVES." And then we every one of these CVES." And then we every one of these CVES." And then we go, "We're not vulnerable. We're not go, "We're not vulnerable. We're not go, "We're not vulnerable. We're not vulnerable. We're not vulnerable. We're vulnerable. We're not vulnerable. We're vulnerable. We're not vulnerable. We're not vulnerable. We're not like and and not vulnerable. We're not like and and not vulnerable. We're not like and and that this is a big problem. It's not that this is a big problem. It's not that this is a big problem. It's not just us. I have several conversations just us. I have several conversations just us. I have several conversations here with other vendors running the very here with other vendors running the very here with other vendors running the very same issue that they're because they're same issue that they're because they're same issue that they're because they're only pulling like they said at the only pulling like they said at the only pulling like they said at the start, the majority of their data comes start, the majority of their data comes start, the majority of their data comes from MVD. They're simply looking at from MVD. They're simply looking at from MVD. They're simply looking at things like P like package inversion and things like P like package inversion and things like P like package inversion and not considering what it's running on. not considering what it's running on. not considering what it's running on. And that's why I'd love to have a And that's why I'd love to have a And that's why I'd love to have a centralized feed that we could get every centralized feed that we could get every centralized feed that we could get every because going also going to the scanner because going also going to the scanner because going also going to the scanner vendors and saying pull every one of the vendors and saying pull every one of the vendors and saying pull every one of the vendor ces files into your scanner. vendor ces files into your scanner. vendor ces files into your scanner. That's probably going to be a difficult That's probably going to be a difficult That's probably going to be a difficult thing to do. But if we had a central one thing to do. But if we had a central one thing to do. But if we had a central one pull this one data feed that has all the pull this one data feed that has all the pull this one data feed that has all the vendor information in it, that's not a vendor information in it, that's not a vendor information in it, that's not a big problem. I think we could get big problem. I think we could get big problem. I think we could get scanner vendors to do that. C can I scanner vendors to do that. C can I scanner vendors to do that. C can I answer that question too? I'm again oh answer that question too? I'm again oh answer that question too? I'm again oh going to start with and gripe because going to start with and gripe because going to start with and gripe because they're open source. They only have 22 they're open source. They only have 22 they're open source. They only have 22 feeds. No vendor data, nothing. 22 feeds feeds. No vendor data, nothing. 22 feeds feeds. No vendor data, nothing. 22 feeds and most of that is the package manager and most of that is the package manager and most of that is the package manager stuff and and NVD and a couple other stuff and and NVD and a couple other stuff and and NVD and a couple other sources like and all of the other sources like and all of the other sources like and all of the other vendors I have talked to they're not vendors I have talked to they're not vendors I have talked to they're not going to there's thousands of vendors going to there's thousands of vendors going to there's thousands of vendors out there they can't go to everyone's out there they can't go to everyone's out there they can't go to everyone's website and pull that data they're just website and pull that data they're just website and pull that data they're just pulling from the main feeds that are pulling from the main feeds that are pulling from the main feeds that are machine readable and that's been my machine readable and that's been my machine readable and that's been my experience every time I talk to a vendor experience every time I talk to a vendor experience every time I talk to a vendor about them like if there was one source about them like if there was one source about them like if there was one source they would go to that and they don't they would go to that and they don't they would go to that and they don't have the money for to hire a hundred have the money for to hire a hundred have the money for to hire a hundred security research researchers, right? security research researchers, right? security research researchers, right? That would cost them too much money and That would cost them too much money and That would cost them too much money and that's what it would take to manually that's what it would take to manually that's what it would take to manually pull all of that data together and and pull all of that data together and and pull all of that data together and and score it. It it's just too much money to score it. It it's just too much money to score it. It it's just too much money to not be centralized and it should be not be centralized and it should be not be centralized and it should be centralized. And on top of that, like I centralized. And on top of that, like I centralized. And on top of that, like I I didn't buy the SEA tool to make that I didn't buy the SEA tool to make that I didn't buy the SEA tool to make that determination. I just bought it to find determination. I just bought it to find determination. I just bought it to find what's in my software, right? They what's in my software, right? They what's in my software, right? They should not be in charge of scoring and should not be in charge of scoring and should not be in charge of scoring and hiding, you know, like the vulnerability hiding, you know, like the vulnerability hiding, you know, like the vulnerability information behind a payw wall. that information behind a payw wall. that information behind a payw wall. that that should not be their purview. I just that should not be their purview. I just that should not be their purview. I just want them to scan my software and tell want them to scan my software and tell want them to scan my software and tell me what's in it. I I would even add that me what's in it. I I would even add that me what's in it. I I would even add that on top of that when you were saying yeah on top of that when you were saying yeah on top of that when you were saying yeah the with the scanning solutions they the with the scanning solutions they the with the scanning solutions they have we don't cover all vulnerabilities have we don't cover all vulnerabilities have we don't cover all vulnerabilities with the scanners. It's impossible like with the scanners. It's impossible like with the scanners. It's impossible like we were doing uh some and research last we were doing uh some and research last we were doing uh some and research last year because we did present it 50% of year because we did present it 50% of year because we did present it 50% of the high and critical vulnerabilities the high and critical vulnerabilities the high and critical vulnerabilities they don't have a signature. I cannot they don't have a signature. I cannot they don't have a signature. I cannot rely on the scans rely on the scans rely on the scans to be secure and patch everything. I to be secure and patch everything. I to be secure and patch everything. I need to have the source of those need to have the source of those need to have the source of those informations and then we need to have it informations and then we need to have it informations and then we need to have it in a way that it's easy for us to in a way that it's easy for us to in a way that it's easy for us to automatize things because if you have 10 automatize things because if you have 10 automatize things because if you have 10 vulnerabilities, it's fine. If you see vulnerabilities, it's fine. If you see vulnerabilities, it's fine. If you see the amount of vulnerabilities we have the amount of vulnerabilities we have the amount of vulnerabilities we have every day, we cannot be reading every day, we cannot be reading every day, we cannot be reading something that it's nice for a person, something that it's nice for a person, something that it's nice for a person, but you cannot put it in a system that but you cannot put it in a system that but you cannot put it in a system that will automatically create everything. So will automatically create everything. So will automatically create everything. So I think it's important that we have a I think it's important that we have a I think it's important that we have a place where we can get everything. We place where we can get everything. We place where we can get everything. We don't have to go to thousand of places. don't have to go to thousand of places. don't have to go to thousand of places. We miss half of it or we have to pay We miss half of it or we have to pay We miss half of it or we have to pay someone else to to do that job because someone else to to do that job because someone else to to do that job because at the end it's information that we at the end it's information that we at the end it's information that we really need it and we well that's what I really need it and we well that's what I really need it and we well that's what I was saying. We in our case we don't rely was saying. We in our case we don't rely was saying. We in our case we don't rely on scans. We do scans but scans come I on scans. We do scans but scans come I on scans. We do scans but scans come I don't know maybe two days after three don't know maybe two days after three don't know maybe two days after three days after so it's more about okay I days after so it's more about okay I days after so it's more about okay I already notify uh you already started already notify uh you already started already notify uh you already started the patching I can validate that the the patching I can validate that the the patching I can validate that the patch was correctly deployed because I patch was correctly deployed because I patch was correctly deployed because I have a scan but relying only on that you have a scan but relying only on that you have a scan but relying only on that you are missing a lot of So um two comments on what you said. So um two comments on what you said. So um two comments on what you said. First kind of we as a vendor are also First kind of we as a vendor are also First kind of we as a vendor are also running our infrastructure and it's kind running our infrastructure and it's kind running our infrastructure and it's kind of a pain to get our vulnerabilities of a pain to get our vulnerabilities of a pain to get our vulnerabilities into our infrastructure because into our infrastructure because into our infrastructure because basically the scanners are all open basically the scanners are all open basically the scanners are all open source vulnerabilities like meant like source vulnerabilities like meant like source vulnerabilities like meant like OSV and we cannot get our information OSV and we cannot get our information OSV and we cannot get our information into that systems because we're not open into that systems because we're not open into that systems because we're not open sourced. So that's a big problem. And sourced. So that's a big problem. And sourced. So that's a big problem. And the second maybe more fundamental the second maybe more fundamental the second maybe more fundamental question that I would want to ask like question that I would want to ask like question that I would want to ask like we're discussing about this sbomb and we're discussing about this sbomb and we're discussing about this sbomb and relationship scanning and basically relationship scanning and basically relationship scanning and basically coming up with an sbomb is really a pain coming up with an sbomb is really a pain coming up with an sbomb is really a pain and we need to have a verification that and we need to have a verification that and we need to have a verification that the sbomb that we came up with is the sbomb that we came up with is the sbomb that we came up with is correct. So there I see definitely a correct. So there I see definitely a correct. So there I see definitely a point where scanning makes sense but um point where scanning makes sense but um point where scanning makes sense but um at the phase of vulnerability at the phase of vulnerability at the phase of vulnerability um assessment when we start scanning um assessment when we start scanning um assessment when we start scanning we're basically lost. So from that we're basically lost. So from that we're basically lost. So from that perspective I really would ask like how perspective I really would ask like how perspective I really would ask like how can we enable and yes my uh employer is can we enable and yes my uh employer is can we enable and yes my uh employer is also not so okay um how do we enable the also not so okay um how do we enable the also not so okay um how do we enable the asset management systems that basically asset management systems that basically asset management systems that basically people don't need to scan what they have people don't need to scan what they have people don't need to scan what they have but basically be able to catalog what but basically be able to catalog what but basically be able to catalog what they have and that's actually that's actually that's actually uh well let's put as a second point of uh well let's put as a second point of uh well let's put as a second point of order you could actually put bombs as order you could actually put bombs as order you could actually put bombs as another point of order on I'm not sure another point of order on I'm not sure another point of order on I'm not sure which the order is. Um, but I know I which the order is. Um, but I know I which the order is. Um, but I know I don't want to I don't want to eat all don't want to I don't want to eat all don't want to I don't want to eat all those elephants at once because that's a those elephants at once because that's a those elephants at once because that's a herd. Um, but the point is correct herd. Um, but the point is correct herd. Um, but the point is correct because it uh for those who are because it uh for those who are because it uh for those who are associated with US federal government, associated with US federal government, associated with US federal government, they had the continuous diagnostic and they had the continuous diagnostic and they had the continuous diagnostic and mitigation program. Okay. I mean this is mitigation program. Okay. I mean this is mitigation program. Okay. I mean this is like uh what 10 years ago or like uh what 10 years ago or like uh what 10 years ago or so. Okay. It's Yeah, I know it's still so. Okay. It's Yeah, I know it's still so. Okay. It's Yeah, I know it's still there. But phase one, what what was there. But phase one, what what was there. But phase one, what what was phase one phase one phase one about? Okay. Software asset management, about? Okay. Software asset management, about? Okay. Software asset management, hardware asset management, configuration hardware asset management, configuration hardware asset management, configuration management, vulnerability management, vulnerability management, vulnerability management. We're talking about the same management. We're talking about the same management. We're talking about the same thing. To to Vince's point, 10 years thing. To to Vince's point, 10 years thing. To to Vince's point, 10 years later, it's still not solved. And and I later, it's still not solved. And and I later, it's still not solved. And and I think because we went into this think because we went into this think because we went into this um well, without knowing what we know um well, without knowing what we know um well, without knowing what we know now, okay, put that way. and and it's now, okay, put that way. and and it's now, okay, put that way. and and it's just a matter of how do we leap forward just a matter of how do we leap forward just a matter of how do we leap forward because this is I'll put as a shared because this is I'll put as a shared because this is I'll put as a shared responsibility. Okay, as a CNA, you're responsibility. Okay, as a CNA, you're responsibility. Okay, as a CNA, you're responsible for your responsible for your responsible for your scope. Let's just use that knowledge to scope. Let's just use that knowledge to scope. Let's just use that knowledge to help everyone else help everyone else help everyone else along. Okay? Not saying there's not along. Okay? Not saying there's not along. Okay? Not saying there's not validation. validation. validation. Not saying there's not a level of trust Not saying there's not a level of trust Not saying there's not a level of trust as you move up on CNAs. I think those as you move up on CNAs. I think those as you move up on CNAs. I think those are all part of that process to get to are all part of that process to get to are all part of that process to get to the end the end the end goal, but technology-wise, I don't think goal, but technology-wise, I don't think goal, but technology-wise, I don't think this is impossible. Just takes a lot of this is impossible. Just takes a lot of this is impossible. Just takes a lot of effort collectively because if we do it effort collectively because if we do it effort collectively because if we do it separately, we're going to be too separately, we're going to be too separately, we're going to be too dispersed and no one's going to pay dispersed and no one's going to pay dispersed and no one's going to pay attention to it. And at the end of the attention to it. And at the end of the attention to it. And at the end of the day, we're looking at how do you get day, we're looking at how do you get day, we're looking at how do you get everyone that's consuming this, whether everyone that's consuming this, whether everyone that's consuming this, whether they're a security vendor, they're a they're a security vendor, they're a they're a security vendor, they're a government agency, or they're a consumer government agency, or they're a consumer government agency, or they're a consumer enterprise, to take it, not have to do loads of extra work. The question I have for you all work. The question I have for you all work. The question I have for you all is, are we willing Yeah. Is it necessary? Okay. And Chris, I know necessary? Okay. And Chris, I know necessary? Okay. And Chris, I know you've been listening, so I you can you've been listening, so I you can you've been listening, so I you can always comment. So yeah, I I look at, you know, MVD took So yeah, I I look at, you know, MVD took So yeah, I I look at, you know, MVD took on a really big problem set and it just on a really big problem set and it just on a really big problem set and it just is too big. So join big. So join big. So join forces. That's that's the real forces. That's that's the real forces. That's that's the real point. Well, I'm not going to end on a point. Well, I'm not going to end on a point. Well, I'm not going to end on a high note. I'm gonna let Lisa end us on high note. I'm gonna let Lisa end us on high note. I'm gonna let Lisa end us on a high note. a high note. a high note. I I think it's worth the work to try to I I think it's worth the work to try to I I think it's worth the work to try to move this ball forward and and we're move this ball forward and and we're move this ball forward and and we're never all going to agree, but we can all never all going to agree, but we can all never all going to agree, but we can all take baby steps and and and try to get take baby steps and and and try to get take baby steps and and and try to get there. So, but I think it's worth it. there. So, but I think it's worth it. there. So, but I think it's worth it. It's very hard, It's very hard, It's very hard, extremely hard. So, um couple people extremely hard. So, um couple people extremely hard. So, um couple people have approached me about some of this, have approached me about some of this, have approached me about some of this, okay? Um in various aspects. So, if okay? Um in various aspects. So, if okay? Um in various aspects. So, if you're willing, okay. you're willing, okay. you're willing, okay. Um, God, I'm I'm about to do something fatal. If your organization's willing, I fatal. If your organization's willing, I fatal. If your organization's willing, I don't need 20 emails from every don't need 20 emails from every don't need 20 emails from every organization, but you can send me an organization, but you can send me an organization, but you can send me an email. email. email. So, p a So, p a So, p a lred lred lred hat.com. Okay. I was going to use net hat.com. Okay. I was going to use net hat.com. Okay. I was going to use net but it go into a hole and then my boss but it go into a hole and then my boss but it go into a hole and then my boss asked me did you get any answers so uh asked me did you get any answers so uh asked me did you get any answers so uh send it to me and I'll put you into um a send it to me and I'll put you into um a send it to me and I'll put you into um a mailing list that we can start figuring mailing list that we can start figuring mailing list that we can start figuring out what are out what are out what are steps you know what are our proposal how steps you know what are our proposal how steps you know what are our proposal how do we go about it and see if we can get do we go about it and see if we can get do we go about it and see if we can get some momentum here uh and compare that some momentum here uh and compare that some momentum here uh and compare that with other with other with other groups and I think you're going to in groups and I think you're going to in groups and I think you're going to in the closing you hear elements of this the closing you hear elements of this the closing you hear elements of this because I don't think this is the only because I don't think this is the only because I don't think this is the only area that we should be collaborating area that we should be collaborating area that we should be collaborating on. We we need to collaborate across on. We we need to collaborate across on. We we need to collaborate across this entire space because you hear this entire space because you hear this entire space because you hear governments, you hear large critical governments, you hear large critical governments, you hear large critical infrastructures and you hear the midsize infrastructures and you hear the midsize infrastructures and you hear the midsize and smalls size and smalls size and smalls size business screaming for help. You know, we got to work that out. help. You know, we got to work that out. help. You know, we got to work that out. So, um if you're willing, I'd like to So, um if you're willing, I'd like to So, um if you're willing, I'd like to hear from you. hear from you. hear from you. Don't make me go look up your Don't make me go look up your Don't make me go look up your email. Otherwise, I'll have to send you email. Otherwise, I'll have to send you email. Otherwise, I'll have to send you a note. Say, you nodded your head. Okay. Um, any last comments from anyone? Okay. I'm beating the hook, Valerie. I am impressed. Pete never ends Valerie. I am impressed. Pete never ends Valerie. I am impressed. Pete never ends early, but I think this is warranted. early, but I think this is warranted. early, but I think this is warranted. So, let's give him a round of applause. So, let's give him a round of applause. So, let's give him a round of applause. And Lisa as well.
