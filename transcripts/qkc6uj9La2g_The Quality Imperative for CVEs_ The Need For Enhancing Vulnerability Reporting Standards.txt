Kind: captions Language: en Morning everybody. Welcome to day two of Morning everybody. Welcome to day two of Morning everybody. Welcome to day two of con. Uh so about this talk, I I just con. Uh so about this talk, I I just con. Uh so about this talk, I I just want to get this out of the way at the want to get this out of the way at the want to get this out of the way at the first. This talk was not designed to first. This talk was not designed to first. This talk was not designed to embarrass anyone or to to point fingers embarrass anyone or to to point fingers embarrass anyone or to to point fingers at certain CNAs or flaws. This is a talk at certain CNAs or flaws. This is a talk at certain CNAs or flaws. This is a talk to help us all as a community get to help us all as a community get to help us all as a community get better. I rely on the NVD data in my day better. I rely on the NVD data in my day better. I rely on the NVD data in my day job every and the CVE data in my day job job every and the CVE data in my day job job every and the CVE data in my day job every day. I use it. I think most people every day. I use it. I think most people every day. I use it. I think most people in this room who are consumers use this in this room who are consumers use this in this room who are consumers use this data to help protect the internet. So data to help protect the internet. So data to help protect the internet. So while I do have some criticisms of the while I do have some criticisms of the while I do have some criticisms of the data as the way it's currently data as the way it's currently data as the way it's currently structured, this is not a talk just for structured, this is not a talk just for structured, this is not a talk just for me to to pick at the CVE program and me to to pick at the CVE program and me to to pick at the CVE program and NVD. I have some suggestions at the end NVD. I have some suggestions at the end NVD. I have some suggestions at the end and most of this talk will be around the and most of this talk will be around the and most of this talk will be around the community coming together and helping community coming together and helping community coming together and helping drive these things forward and other drive these things forward and other drive these things forward and other ideas. These are just my ideas. they may ideas. These are just my ideas. they may ideas. These are just my ideas. they may not be all right, but just sitting down, not be all right, but just sitting down, not be all right, but just sitting down, this is just what I thought at the time. this is just what I thought at the time. this is just what I thought at the time. So, a little bit about me. Uh, my name So, a little bit about me. Uh, my name So, a little bit about me. Uh, my name is Jerry Gamblin. I'm in the threat is Jerry Gamblin. I'm in the threat is Jerry Gamblin. I'm in the threat detection and response group at Cisco. detection and response group at Cisco. detection and response group at Cisco. Um, that's a product group. So, I am not Um, that's a product group. So, I am not Um, that's a product group. So, I am not in Talos. I am not a part of the CNA in Talos. I am not a part of the CNA in Talos. I am not a part of the CNA groups that that Cisco runs. I help groups that that Cisco runs. I help groups that that Cisco runs. I help develop and input vulnerability data develop and input vulnerability data develop and input vulnerability data into all of the products at Cisco. So we into all of the products at Cisco. So we into all of the products at Cisco. So we have Cisco vulnerability management. We have Cisco vulnerability management. We have Cisco vulnerability management. We have an XDR platform. We have a bunch of have an XDR platform. We have a bunch of have an XDR platform. We have a bunch of AI platforms, right? So my job is to AI platforms, right? So my job is to AI platforms, right? So my job is to take the data from the CVE.org and from take the data from the CVE.org and from take the data from the CVE.org and from NVD and to put it into our products to NVD and to put it into our products to NVD and to put it into our products to help protect our end customers. So I help protect our end customers. So I help protect our end customers. So I have a different view of the data than have a different view of the data than have a different view of the data than some of the CNA sitting in this room and some of the CNA sitting in this room and some of the CNA sitting in this room and some of the other people. So so that is some of the other people. So so that is some of the other people. So so that is where I come from on this. I am also a where I come from on this. I am also a where I come from on this. I am also a member of the quality working group and member of the quality working group and member of the quality working group and the automation working group for for the the automation working group for for the the automation working group for for the CVE program. I would suggest that if CVE program. I would suggest that if CVE program. I would suggest that if you're interested in this data, please you're interested in this data, please you're interested in this data, please join the quality working group program join the quality working group program join the quality working group program as that is where a bunch of these get as that is where a bunch of these get as that is where a bunch of these get discussed in discussed in discussed in detail. Uh so super quick here, we're detail. Uh so super quick here, we're detail. Uh so super quick here, we're just going to have three points and I'm just going to have three points and I'm just going to have three points and I'm going to leave time for questions and going to leave time for questions and going to leave time for questions and discussions at the end. We're just going discussions at the end. We're just going discussions at the end. We're just going to go over the current challenges, um my to go over the current challenges, um my to go over the current challenges, um my proposed enhancements to CVE quality, proposed enhancements to CVE quality, proposed enhancements to CVE quality, and then what we can do with stakeholder and then what we can do with stakeholder and then what we can do with stakeholder collaboration. So, we have a problem with CVEEs having So, we have a problem with CVEEs having So, we have a problem with CVEEs having incomplete or inaccurate information. incomplete or inaccurate information. incomplete or inaccurate information. That that's just a fairly known fact. That that's just a fairly known fact. That that's just a fairly known fact. Does anybody know how many data points a Does anybody know how many data points a Does anybody know how many data points a CNA has to provide for a CVE CNA has to provide for a CVE CNA has to provide for a CVE record? Three. There are there are three record? Three. There are there are three record? Three. There are there are three fields that are required to publish a fields that are required to publish a fields that are required to publish a CVE. Does anybody know how those three CVE. Does anybody know how those three CVE. Does anybody know how those three fields are quality checked? fields are quality checked? fields are quality checked? any it it has to be here is the only any it it has to be here is the only any it it has to be here is the only quality check ran on CVEes at this time. quality check ran on CVEes at this time. quality check ran on CVEes at this time. The description has to be a string The description has to be a string The description has to be a string between 1 and between 1 and between 1 and 4,916 characters. That is the extent of 4,916 characters. That is the extent of 4,916 characters. That is the extent of quality checking that is performed quality checking that is performed quality checking that is performed by by the CVE by by the CVE program by by the CVE by by the CVE program by by the CVE by by the CVE program before publication. before publication. before publication. Um, we also get the point of minimal Um, we also get the point of minimal Um, we also get the point of minimal data required. These are some of the data required. These are some of the data required. These are some of the shortest CVE descriptions in the last shortest CVE descriptions in the last shortest CVE descriptions in the last three years. Um, I I tried to find one three years. Um, I I tried to find one three years. Um, I I tried to find one from from from 2025. We didn't have any three-word 2025. We didn't have any three-word 2025. We didn't have any three-word descriptions this year. We did have a descriptions this year. We did have a descriptions this year. We did have a four-word description. So, we're we're four-word description. So, we're we're four-word description. So, we're we're getting a little better. Um, I don't getting a little better. Um, I don't getting a little better. Um, I don't think anybody looking at these CVE think anybody looking at these CVE think anybody looking at these CVE descriptions could could make a good descriptions could could make a good descriptions could could make a good judgment on what they were for or how judgment on what they were for or how judgment on what they were for or how they they they are. And then we get into some data are. And then we get into some data are. And then we get into some data quality issues. Let's just start with quality issues. Let's just start with quality issues. Let's just start with the schemas. Um, the CVE schema has 163 the schemas. Um, the CVE schema has 163 the schemas. Um, the CVE schema has 163 keys. Only 60% of those keys in the keys. Only 60% of those keys in the keys. Only 60% of those keys in the schema have a description telling you schema have a description telling you schema have a description telling you what that key does. what that key does. what that key does. uh and only 50% of the fields tell you uh and only 50% of the fields tell you uh and only 50% of the fields tell you what type of data should be in that what type of data should be in that what type of data should be in that field. Uh there are nine total required field. Uh there are nine total required field. Uh there are nine total required fields for for it to come through fields for for it to come through fields for for it to come through publication. Six of those are automated publication. Six of those are automated publication. Six of those are automated and then we talk about the three that and then we talk about the three that and then we talk about the three that you have to get from you have to get from you have to get from uh from the uh from the uh from the CNA. The NVD schema is is not much CNA. The NVD schema is is not much CNA. The NVD schema is is not much better. There are 262 keys in the NVD better. There are 262 keys in the NVD better. There are 262 keys in the NVD schema. uh 3% of those keys have schema. uh 3% of those keys have schema. uh 3% of those keys have descriptions descriptions descriptions uh and only one field is required for uh and only one field is required for uh and only one field is required for the MVD publication. The good part about the MVD publication. The good part about the MVD publication. The good part about the MVD is that nobody publishes to the MVD is that nobody publishes to the MVD is that nobody publishes to those those those directories. Uh Dr. Benjamin Edwards did directories. Uh Dr. Benjamin Edwards did directories. Uh Dr. Benjamin Edwards did a great talk at at Vol forecast last a great talk at at Vol forecast last a great talk at at Vol forecast last year and I'm not going to to repeat that year and I'm not going to to repeat that year and I'm not going to to repeat that but there's a link at the bottom of this but there's a link at the bottom of this but there's a link at the bottom of this and I'll share the slides. He talks and I'll share the slides. He talks and I'll share the slides. He talks about CNA completeness in records. Uh, about CNA completeness in records. Uh, about CNA completeness in records. Uh, and very few CNAs are completing most of and very few CNAs are completing most of and very few CNAs are completing most of their records. This is an excellent, their records. This is an excellent, their records. This is an excellent, this is an eye chart here. You can't see this is an eye chart here. You can't see this is an eye chart here. You can't see it very well, but if you go to to the it very well, but if you go to to the it very well, but if you go to to the link at the bottom of this slide, and link at the bottom of this slide, and link at the bottom of this slide, and I'll try to get it shared out. It's on I'll try to get it shared out. It's on I'll try to get it shared out. It's on the bit site website. It really talks the bit site website. It really talks the bit site website. It really talks about what CNAs fill in which fields. about what CNAs fill in which fields. about what CNAs fill in which fields. And outside of the top three, everything And outside of the top three, everything And outside of the top three, everything just just dies off. just just dies off. just just dies off. Uh here's an overview of all of the Uh here's an overview of all of the Uh here's an overview of all of the CVEes published on CVEes published on CVEes published on CVE.org. And somehow, and not somehow, CVE.org. And somehow, and not somehow, CVE.org. And somehow, and not somehow, it's because they just added data it's because they just added data it's because they just added data quality checks before. Only 80.1% of all quality checks before. Only 80.1% of all quality checks before. Only 80.1% of all CVEes have the third required field of CVEes have the third required field of CVEes have the third required field of products. So that means 20% of all CVEes products. So that means 20% of all CVEes products. So that means 20% of all CVEes that are published don't even meet the that are published don't even meet the that are published don't even meet the minimum requirements of three fields per minimum requirements of three fields per minimum requirements of three fields per CVE. Um, this is this can be checked on CVE. Um, this is this can be checked on CVE. Um, this is this can be checked on Ben's data. I trust Ben's data. He does Ben's data. I trust Ben's data. He does Ben's data. I trust Ben's data. He does does a great job, but I would really does a great job, but I would really does a great job, but I would really like you to talk to him about the data like you to talk to him about the data like you to talk to him about the data and I'm happy to to look at it, too. But and I'm happy to to look at it, too. But and I'm happy to to look at it, too. But I looked at it at Vol forecast and his I looked at it at Vol forecast and his I looked at it at Vol forecast and his methods are are great. So, I do trust methods are are great. So, I do trust methods are are great. So, I do trust these these these numbers. So, let's get to data issues. I numbers. So, let's get to data issues. I numbers. So, let's get to data issues. I know that nobody likes to talk about know that nobody likes to talk about know that nobody likes to talk about this, but what is a source of truth for this, but what is a source of truth for this, but what is a source of truth for CVE CVE CVE data? Is it the NVD? Is it CVE.org? data? Is it the NVD? Is it CVE.org? data? Is it the NVD? Is it CVE.org? org. org. org. Um, what should be considered CVE data? Um, what should be considered CVE data? Um, what should be considered CVE data? Is CVSS part of CVE data? Is a CWE part Is CVSS part of CVE data? Is a CWE part Is CVSS part of CVE data? Is a CWE part of CVS CVE of CVS CVE of CVS CVE data? Like to me, those are key parts of data? Like to me, those are key parts of data? Like to me, those are key parts of CVE data. To other people, they don't CVE data. To other people, they don't CVE data. To other people, they don't matter, right? And there's discussions matter, right? And there's discussions matter, right? And there's discussions going on today is should CPE be a going on today is should CPE be a going on today is should CPE be a required part of CVE data? What about required part of CVE data? What about required part of CVE data? What about Pearl? What about an identifier? are Pearl? What about an identifier? are Pearl? What about an identifier? are those parts that make a CVE data or not. We also have the ease of bulk data not. We also have the ease of bulk data not. We also have the ease of bulk data access. The CVE program has decided to access. The CVE program has decided to access. The CVE program has decided to put all of their data into a GitHub repo put all of their data into a GitHub repo put all of their data into a GitHub repo for better or worse. Um, they no for better or worse. Um, they no for better or worse. Um, they no longer they no longer have a public API longer they no longer have a public API longer they no longer have a public API to download data. Um, and to be honest, to download data. Um, and to be honest, to download data. Um, and to be honest, that has really stopped the use of CVE that has really stopped the use of CVE that has really stopped the use of CVE data in open source projects. Period. I data in open source projects. Period. I data in open source projects. Period. I I just gave a talk yesterday on using I just gave a talk yesterday on using I just gave a talk yesterday on using Jupyter notebooks for open source Jupyter notebooks for open source Jupyter notebooks for open source projects. I went to GitHub and looked. projects. I went to GitHub and looked. projects. I went to GitHub and looked. There are very very few projects out There are very very few projects out There are very very few projects out there that use the CVE source data there that use the CVE source data there that use the CVE source data because a it's hard to get and b it's because a it's hard to get and b it's because a it's hard to get and b it's hard to to put together. Like if you hard to to put together. Like if you hard to to put together. Like if you wanted to see all of the CVEes from 2025 wanted to see all of the CVEes from 2025 wanted to see all of the CVEes from 2025 that were published by the CVE program, that were published by the CVE program, that were published by the CVE program, you'd have to download the whole data you'd have to download the whole data you'd have to download the whole data set and then parse all that data set by set and then parse all that data set by set and then parse all that data set by the date published to get it because the date published to get it because the date published to get it because they've decided to put all the data into they've decided to put all the data into they've decided to put all the data into the identifiers folders. Right? So you the identifiers folders. Right? So you the identifiers folders. Right? So you can grab the 2025 folder, which you can grab the 2025 folder, which you can grab the 2025 folder, which you might think is all CVE published in might think is all CVE published in might think is all CVE published in 2025, but in reality it's all CVEEs with 2025, but in reality it's all CVEEs with 2025, but in reality it's all CVEEs with a CVE identifier of CVE-2025-00001. So what that does is it CVE-2025-00001. So what that does is it CVE-2025-00001. So what that does is it makes it hard for people who want to do makes it hard for people who want to do makes it hard for people who want to do quick data analysis, see the latest data quick data analysis, see the latest data quick data analysis, see the latest data to actually dig into that data and to to to actually dig into that data and to to to actually dig into that data and to to use it. Um the NVD program, everybody use it. Um the NVD program, everybody use it. Um the NVD program, everybody knows they have instability, right? um knows they have instability, right? um knows they have instability, right? um they're giving bulk download access of they're giving bulk download access of they're giving bulk download access of their 1.1 schema um which is a different their 1.1 schema um which is a different their 1.1 schema um which is a different schema and then their API is the 2.0 schema and then their API is the 2.0 schema and then their API is the 2.0 schema. So if you download the data from schema. So if you download the data from schema. So if you download the data from there, you might be downloading two there, you might be downloading two there, you might be downloading two different sources. So it's hard to different sources. So it's hard to different sources. So it's hard to compare data together. So at a minimum, compare data together. So at a minimum, compare data together. So at a minimum, we have three different sources of CVE we have three different sources of CVE we have three different sources of CVE data that most of the community uses data that most of the community uses data that most of the community uses that are all different. And that's that are all different. And that's that are all different. And that's before we start adding in some of the before we start adding in some of the before we start adding in some of the other data sources and thirdparty other data sources and thirdparty other data sources and thirdparty databases like OSV and GitHub. uh databases like OSV and GitHub. uh databases like OSV and GitHub. uh security advisory. Um, so we really need security advisory. Um, so we really need security advisory. Um, so we really need to work on both who is the source of to work on both who is the source of to work on both who is the source of truth for CVE data and and make it easy truth for CVE data and and make it easy truth for CVE data and and make it easy and make it generally available for all and make it generally available for all and make it generally available for all the data to be downloaded in one place the data to be downloaded in one place the data to be downloaded in one place and figure out if it is the NVD or if and figure out if it is the NVD or if and figure out if it is the NVD or if CVE is going to be the source of truth CVE is going to be the source of truth CVE is going to be the source of truth for data that we we develop an API that for data that we we develop an API that for data that we we develop an API that is worthwhile and we develop a way to is worthwhile and we develop a way to is worthwhile and we develop a way to download the data and use it in open download the data and use it in open download the data and use it in open source projects which we'll talk on source projects which we'll talk on source projects which we'll talk on later. later. later. Uh we'll stop there. Does anybody have Uh we'll stop there. Does anybody have Uh we'll stop there. Does anybody have any questions about this first part of any questions about this first part of any questions about this first part of kind of my overview of the CVE data? We kind of my overview of the CVE data? We kind of my overview of the CVE data? We because from here on we're going to talk because from here on we're going to talk because from here on we're going to talk about some proposed solutions that I about some proposed solutions that I about some proposed solutions that I have and enhancements that I would like have and enhancements that I would like have and enhancements that I would like to see made. I I I can't I cannot speak. Jerry, can I I I can't I cannot speak. Jerry, can I I I can't I cannot speak. Jerry, can you repeat the question for the virtual you repeat the question for the virtual you repeat the question for the virtual The question is why isn't there a The question is why isn't there a The question is why isn't there a CVE.org API? Um there was I am not 100% CVE.org API? Um there was I am not 100% CVE.org API? Um there was I am not 100% sure the technical reasons. I think the sure the technical reasons. I think the sure the technical reasons. I think the decision was made at the board level. decision was made at the board level. decision was made at the board level. Meazone is in here. I don't want to put Meazone is in here. I don't want to put Meazone is in here. I don't want to put him on the spot, but he might have an him on the spot, but he might have an him on the spot, but he might have an answer to why there's only the GitHub answer to why there's only the GitHub answer to why there's only the GitHub repository and not a public API. repository and not a public API. repository and not a public API. I I joined the board after the decision I I joined the board after the decision I I joined the board after the decision was made, but I was on the working was made, but I was on the working was made, but I was on the working groups while that decision was made. I groups while that decision was made. I groups while that decision was made. I believe it was mostly just cost was the believe it was mostly just cost was the believe it was mostly just cost was the the the data cost the for budget reasons the the data cost the for budget reasons the the data cost the for budget reasons of what using GitHub and fact that of what using GitHub and fact that of what using GitHub and fact that they're willing to support us basically. they're willing to support us basically. they're willing to support us basically. I don't want to no cost really for so I don't want to no cost really for so I don't want to no cost really for so doing the bulk downloads there save the doing the bulk downloads there save the doing the bulk downloads there save the program the cost of having to support program the cost of having to support program the cost of having to support the data, you know, downloading that the data, you know, downloading that the data, you know, downloading that bulk data all the time. Um I I kind of bulk data all the time. Um I I kind of bulk data all the time. Um I I kind of agree though. I'd love to see us have an agree though. I'd love to see us have an agree though. I'd love to see us have an API Yep. All right. Thank you guys. Um, Yep. All right. Thank you guys. Um, Yep. All right. Thank you guys. Um, let's go into some proposed solutions. I let's go into some proposed solutions. I let's go into some proposed solutions. I really want this to be interactive. If really want this to be interactive. If really want this to be interactive. If you have any questions or any thoughts you have any questions or any thoughts you have any questions or any thoughts on any of these topics I have, please on any of these topics I have, please on any of these topics I have, please let me know. Um, and once again, these let me know. Um, and once again, these let me know. Um, and once again, these are just my proposed solutions as parts, are just my proposed solutions as parts, are just my proposed solutions as parts, part insider. I'm on a couple working part insider. I'm on a couple working part insider. I'm on a couple working groups and I work with this data every groups and I work with this data every groups and I work with this data every day. So, these are just my my overall day. So, these are just my my overall day. So, these are just my my overall thoughts. Um, we need to enhance the thoughts. Um, we need to enhance the thoughts. Um, we need to enhance the publication status, right? uh CVSS, CP, publication status, right? uh CVSS, CP, publication status, right? uh CVSS, CP, and CWE need to be mandatory fields in and CWE need to be mandatory fields in and CWE need to be mandatory fields in in this in a CVE record going forward. I in this in a CVE record going forward. I in this in a CVE record going forward. I know a lot of people don't like that. I know a lot of people don't like that. I know a lot of people don't like that. I know for the longest time the thing was know for the longest time the thing was know for the longest time the thing was we need to make this as easy as possible we need to make this as easy as possible we need to make this as easy as possible for people to publish CVEEs, right? for people to publish CVEEs, right? for people to publish CVEEs, right? That's why we're at three mandatory That's why we're at three mandatory That's why we're at three mandatory fields. But if the NVD is going to step fields. But if the NVD is going to step fields. But if the NVD is going to step back and not be able to enrich the data back and not be able to enrich the data back and not be able to enrich the data and make it useful for downstream and make it useful for downstream and make it useful for downstream customers, we need to move that customers, we need to move that customers, we need to move that responsibility back to the CNAs to to responsibility back to the CNAs to to responsibility back to the CNAs to to provide that information. Uh we also provide that information. Uh we also provide that information. Uh we also should get rid of the references and and should get rid of the references and and should get rid of the references and and make that be included in the data. Uh make that be included in the data. Uh make that be included in the data. Uh right now I'm a part of a program uh right now I'm a part of a program uh right now I'm a part of a program uh from the automated working group that's from the automated working group that's from the automated working group that's trying to build a link scraper uh for trying to build a link scraper uh for trying to build a link scraper uh for the CWE uh for the CVE program because the CWE uh for the CVE program because the CWE uh for the CVE program because of how poorly links go away. We could of how poorly links go away. We could of how poorly links go away. We could easily fix this by requiring either a easily fix this by requiring either a easily fix this by requiring either a VEX uh part of the of the record or if VEX uh part of the of the record or if VEX uh part of the of the record or if not at a minimum just a markdown plain not at a minimum just a markdown plain not at a minimum just a markdown plain text of here's what you had in your text of here's what you had in your text of here's what you had in your advisory. We're going to store this advisory. We're going to store this advisory. We're going to store this data. We don't even have to display it data. We don't even have to display it data. We don't even have to display it all the time, but in five years when all the time, but in five years when all the time, but in five years when when your website's down, we now have a when your website's down, we now have a when your website's down, we now have a copy of of what you said in your copy of of what you said in your copy of of what you said in your advisory because right now it it's super advisory because right now it it's super advisory because right now it it's super hard. Um, scraping is possible, but a hard. Um, scraping is possible, but a hard. Um, scraping is possible, but a lot of it it's a lot of headaches to get lot of it it's a lot of headaches to get lot of it it's a lot of headaches to get full data control because if you've ever full data control because if you've ever full data control because if you've ever tried to scrape a website, uh, sometimes tried to scrape a website, uh, sometimes tried to scrape a website, uh, sometimes they don't like it if you come from AWS. they don't like it if you come from AWS. they don't like it if you come from AWS. Sometimes they don't like it if you Sometimes they don't like it if you Sometimes they don't like it if you don't use the right thing. Sometimes you don't use the right thing. Sometimes you don't use the right thing. Sometimes you need JavaScript, right? So even the best need JavaScript, right? So even the best need JavaScript, right? So even the best scrapers that we're going to build is scrapers that we're going to build is scrapers that we're going to build is going to be a 90% going to be a 90% going to be a 90% uh completion rate. So we'll get 90% of uh completion rate. So we'll get 90% of uh completion rate. So we'll get 90% of the data in a scraper which we could the data in a scraper which we could the data in a scraper which we could easily just fix by saying hey can you easily just fix by saying hey can you easily just fix by saying hey can you just turn your advisory into plain text just turn your advisory into plain text just turn your advisory into plain text or markdown or vex or whatever and add or markdown or vex or whatever and add or markdown or vex or whatever and add it to the records. Even if that isn't a it to the records. Even if that isn't a it to the records. Even if that isn't a mandatory field it should be a proposed mandatory field it should be a proposed mandatory field it should be a proposed it should be a field that you could use it should be a field that you could use it should be a field that you could use going forward and and we don't have that going forward and and we don't have that going forward and and we don't have that today. today. today. Uh this is the big one. Standardized Uh this is the big one. Standardized Uh this is the big one. Standardized tooling. The CVE program should build tooling. The CVE program should build tooling. The CVE program should build and maintain tooling. They should have a and maintain tooling. They should have a and maintain tooling. They should have a a guey based, a CLI based and popular a guey based, a CLI based and popular a guey based, a CLI based and popular SDKs. Uh who knows what the most popular SDKs. Uh who knows what the most popular SDKs. Uh who knows what the most popular uh CVE publishing tool is uh CVE publishing tool is uh CVE publishing tool is today? today? today? Volig. Do you know who writes Volig. Do you know who writes Volig. Do you know who writes Voligram? Yeah. Do you know how much He Voligram? Yeah. Do you know how much He Voligram? Yeah. Do you know how much He gets paid for that. Nothing. Right. Do gets paid for that. Nothing. Right. Do gets paid for that. Nothing. Right. Do you know how much he supported? Very you know how much he supported? Very you know how much he supported? Very little. Do you know that we had to stop little. Do you know that we had to stop little. Do you know that we had to stop pushing out a schema update because he pushing out a schema update because he pushing out a schema update because he didn't have the time to to update the didn't have the time to to update the didn't have the time to to update the vulner vulnerogram endpoint, right? And vulner vulnerogram endpoint, right? And vulner vulnerogram endpoint, right? And it's an open source project. He has a it's an open source project. He has a it's an open source project. He has a job. He has he has other job. He has he has other job. He has he has other responsibilities. It's best effort. But responsibilities. It's best effort. But responsibilities. It's best effort. But at the end of the day, if the CVE at the end of the day, if the CVE at the end of the day, if the CVE program is going to be serious, at a program is going to be serious, at a program is going to be serious, at a minimum, they should support these. I'm minimum, they should support these. I'm minimum, they should support these. I'm not saying a complete takeover of not saying a complete takeover of not saying a complete takeover of Voligram or trying to fork it, but a Voligram or trying to fork it, but a Voligram or trying to fork it, but a support in some way so that it runs the support in some way so that it runs the support in some way so that it runs the program. And then when we start doing program. And then when we start doing program. And then when we start doing quality control, you're able to build quality control, you're able to build quality control, you're able to build QC, you're able to build checking into QC, you're able to build checking into QC, you're able to build checking into those. And I I know everybody has their those. And I I know everybody has their those. And I I know everybody has their own data workflows at their CNA, but own data workflows at their CNA, but own data workflows at their CNA, but there should be at least a minimal set there should be at least a minimal set there should be at least a minimal set of tooling that is built and maintained of tooling that is built and maintained of tooling that is built and maintained by by the CVE by by the CVE by by the CVE program. Uh, and to be completely program. Uh, and to be completely program. Uh, and to be completely honest, I try not to mention AI a bunch honest, I try not to mention AI a bunch honest, I try not to mention AI a bunch in here because it doesn't it's not in here because it doesn't it's not in here because it doesn't it's not useful. But the CVE program should useful. But the CVE program should useful. But the CVE program should invest in minimal AI tooling so that A invest in minimal AI tooling so that A invest in minimal AI tooling so that A it can suggest improving descriptions. B it can suggest improving descriptions. B it can suggest improving descriptions. B it could suggest C CWES and CVSS scores it could suggest C CWES and CVSS scores it could suggest C CWES and CVSS scores and CPEs, right? Those all exist. and CPEs, right? Those all exist. and CPEs, right? Those all exist. They're they're all uh there was a great They're they're all uh there was a great They're they're all uh there was a great talk on CWE. Somebody built a very very talk on CWE. Somebody built a very very talk on CWE. Somebody built a very very simple model that costs simple model that costs simple model that costs 0.001 cent to run. You give it the 0.001 cent to run. You give it the 0.001 cent to run. You give it the description. It picks what CWE it should description. It picks what CWE it should description. It picks what CWE it should be and it was I think they tested it out be and it was I think they tested it out be and it was I think they tested it out to 95% accuracy, right? Um I would take to 95% accuracy, right? Um I would take to 95% accuracy, right? Um I would take a 95% accuracy guess than than it being a 95% accuracy guess than than it being a 95% accuracy guess than than it being blank in most fields, right? But you blank in most fields, right? But you blank in most fields, right? But you can't do those things and you can't can't do those things and you can't can't do those things and you can't build that kind of tooling into a build that kind of tooling into a build that kind of tooling into a program if the program doesn't own and program if the program doesn't own and program if the program doesn't own and operate basic tooling to do that. Uh I I operate basic tooling to do that. Uh I I operate basic tooling to do that. Uh I I have no problem with open source. I love have no problem with open source. I love have no problem with open source. I love open source. I love that that the open source. I love that that the open source. I love that that the community is there. But if the CVE community is there. But if the CVE community is there. But if the CVE program wants to move forward, they program wants to move forward, they program wants to move forward, they really really need to take an ownership really really need to take an ownership really really need to take an ownership stake and a minimal viable set of tools stake and a minimal viable set of tools stake and a minimal viable set of tools to publish CVEes. to publish CVEes. to publish CVEes. We have a comment in the Discord here. We have a comment in the Discord here. We have a comment in the Discord here. Requiring CBSS, CPE, and C.WE sounds Requiring CBSS, CPE, and C.WE sounds Requiring CBSS, CPE, and C.WE sounds like a good idea, but would be a major like a good idea, but would be a major like a good idea, but would be a major blocker for small OSS projects. Uh this blocker for small OSS projects. Uh this blocker for small OSS projects. Uh this is just too much effort to learn what is just too much effort to learn what is just too much effort to learn what the stuff is. Not even mentioning how to the stuff is. Not even mentioning how to the stuff is. Not even mentioning how to do it right. Yeah, that that can I think do it right. Yeah, that that can I think do it right. Yeah, that that can I think that was an excuse. Now, I think that that was an excuse. Now, I think that that was an excuse. Now, I think that that was the stance of the CVE program that was the stance of the CVE program that was the stance of the CVE program for the last 25 years is we're going to for the last 25 years is we're going to for the last 25 years is we're going to set the bar down here so everybody can set the bar down here so everybody can set the bar down here so everybody can just put in data and we see that even just put in data and we see that even just put in data and we see that even with the bar at three, we still get bad with the bar at three, we still get bad with the bar at three, we still get bad data put into the database. So, I don't data put into the database. So, I don't data put into the database. So, I don't think raising the bar here is going to think raising the bar here is going to think raising the bar here is going to stop that many people from doing it. Um, stop that many people from doing it. Um, stop that many people from doing it. Um, I I have some other suggestions later in I I have some other suggestions later in I I have some other suggestions later in the in the program about training. I am the in the program about training. I am the in the program about training. I am sure that if you're a CNA, the CVSS sure that if you're a CNA, the CVSS sure that if you're a CNA, the CVSS program would love to give you 45 program would love to give you 45 program would love to give you 45 minutes on how to minutes on how to minutes on how to score your CVEes. I I don't think it's a score your CVEes. I I don't think it's a score your CVEes. I I don't think it's a problem. And I I think that that's one problem. And I I think that that's one problem. And I I think that that's one of the key things we need to lean into of the key things we need to lean into of the key things we need to lean into is that just saying, "Oh, somebody won't is that just saying, "Oh, somebody won't is that just saying, "Oh, somebody won't do it because it's hard," means that we do it because it's hard," means that we do it because it's hard," means that we won't do it as a community. is is won't do it as a community. is is won't do it as a community. is is probably a bad place to be in 2025. Hi. Um, love this session by the way. Hi. Um, love this session by the way. Hi. Um, love this session by the way. Um, so what about like a certification Um, so what about like a certification Um, so what about like a certification program? Is that an idea? That that's program? Is that an idea? That that's program? Is that an idea? That that's coming up. Oh, okay. I'll we we're coming up. Oh, okay. I'll we we're coming up. Oh, okay. I'll we we're there. We're getting there. Okay, cool. there. We're getting there. Okay, cool. there. We're getting there. Okay, cool. Uh the last one is quality validation Uh the last one is quality validation Uh the last one is quality validation process. All VCBS should have to pass a process. All VCBS should have to pass a process. All VCBS should have to pass a well doumented and maintained validation well doumented and maintained validation well doumented and maintained validation process. Right? There there should be process. Right? There there should be process. Right? There there should be something that is written and something that is written and something that is written and maintained. It says here's what a great maintained. It says here's what a great maintained. It says here's what a great CVE looks like and you're going to to CVE looks like and you're going to to CVE looks like and you're going to to match this in some way and we can walk match this in some way and we can walk match this in some way and we can walk in there even if you just start by in there even if you just start by in there even if you just start by adding rejects to to most of the schema adding rejects to to most of the schema adding rejects to to most of the schema so that it's matching and matching well. so that it's matching and matching well. so that it's matching and matching well. We can then get into the the wide crazy We can then get into the the wide crazy We can then get into the the wide crazy world of AI to help with description and world of AI to help with description and world of AI to help with description and CW and CBSS, but at some point we have CW and CBSS, but at some point we have CW and CBSS, but at some point we have to step back and say we're not going to to step back and say we're not going to to step back and say we're not going to to do the point where we just allow to do the point where we just allow to do the point where we just allow three three fields to be a CBE three three fields to be a CBE three three fields to be a CBE record. Um, let's talk about stakeholder record. Um, let's talk about stakeholder record. Um, let's talk about stakeholder collaboration. And this is where collaboration. And this is where collaboration. And this is where everybody in the room can help. And I everybody in the room can help. And I everybody in the room can help. And I would love everybody in the room to would love everybody in the room to would love everybody in the room to help. Uh the CVE program should start an help. Uh the CVE program should start an help. Uh the CVE program should start an open source working group tomorrow. Um open source working group tomorrow. Um open source working group tomorrow. Um I'm surprised they they don't have one, I'm surprised they they don't have one, I'm surprised they they don't have one, but there if the tooling is going to but there if the tooling is going to but there if the tooling is going to stay open source, we we should have an stay open source, we we should have an stay open source, we we should have an open source working group for for the open source working group for for the open source working group for for the CVE program. I I'm sure that the Open CVE program. I I'm sure that the Open CVE program. I I'm sure that the Open Source Security Foundation and others Source Security Foundation and others Source Security Foundation and others would be super interested in in working would be super interested in in working would be super interested in in working with that and helping it. Um, the CNA with that and helping it. Um, the CNA with that and helping it. Um, the CNA tooling has to be formalized. I I know tooling has to be formalized. I I know tooling has to be formalized. I I know that I know that the CVE program doesn't that I know that the CVE program doesn't that I know that the CVE program doesn't have unlimited resources, but having a have unlimited resources, but having a have unlimited resources, but having a minimal set of tooling that allows minimal set of tooling that allows minimal set of tooling that allows people to to submit records that are people to to submit records that are people to to submit records that are checked and enriched is is going to be checked and enriched is is going to be checked and enriched is is going to be an important part. And we need to an important part. And we need to an important part. And we need to remember the data consumers. U we should remember the data consumers. U we should remember the data consumers. U we should host a hackathon. I think that that was host a hackathon. I think that that was host a hackathon. I think that that was something that was missing at Volcon. something that was missing at Volcon. something that was missing at Volcon. I'm going to suggest next year is is I'm going to suggest next year is is I'm going to suggest next year is is some kind of half a day hackathon to some kind of half a day hackathon to some kind of half a day hackathon to just come and hack on the data. And then just come and hack on the data. And then just come and hack on the data. And then there's a data science community called there's a data science community called there's a data science community called Kaggle that that runs competitions where Kaggle that that runs competitions where Kaggle that that runs competitions where you say here's our data set. Please tell you say here's our data set. Please tell you say here's our data set. Please tell me what you could do with it and and me what you could do with it and and me what you could do with it and and students and other people take that data students and other people take that data students and other people take that data and build great virtualizations and and build great virtualizations and and build great virtualizations and great models with it and gives it back great models with it and gives it back great models with it and gives it back to the community. Um those are normally to the community. Um those are normally to the community. Um those are normally free are very cheap. Uh get somebody to free are very cheap. Uh get somebody to free are very cheap. Uh get somebody to sponsor some prizes. Sometimes the sponsor some prizes. Sometimes the sponsor some prizes. Sometimes the prizes are, you know, $100 Amazon gift prizes are, you know, $100 Amazon gift prizes are, you know, $100 Amazon gift card for the top one up to to whatever card for the top one up to to whatever card for the top one up to to whatever depending on how you want to motivate depending on how you want to motivate depending on how you want to motivate people, but we don't have the data there people, but we don't have the data there people, but we don't have the data there that that's a that's a very lowcost that that's a that's a very lowcost that that's a that's a very lowcost thing that we could do as a community to thing that we could do as a community to thing that we could do as a community to get people to look at this data. This one is is really big for me. data. This one is is really big for me. data. This one is is really big for me. It's It's It's communication. Uh does anybody know how communication. Uh does anybody know how communication. Uh does anybody know how to reach out to the CVE program? to reach out to the CVE program? to reach out to the CVE program? Does everybody know that they have a Does everybody know that they have a Does everybody know that they have a Slack, but it's not Slack, but it's not Slack, but it's not official? It which is it it's kind of official? It which is it it's kind of official? It which is it it's kind of both ways, right? Like I don't know what both ways, right? Like I don't know what both ways, right? Like I don't know what you need to have the official stamp on you need to have the official stamp on you need to have the official stamp on it on the Slack that says this is how it on the Slack that says this is how it on the Slack that says this is how you talk to the CVE program or other you talk to the CVE program or other you talk to the CVE program or other people in the CVE program, but it's made people in the CVE program, but it's made people in the CVE program, but it's made very clear that the that the Slack that very clear that the that the Slack that very clear that the that the Slack that only has a few hundred people in there only has a few hundred people in there only has a few hundred people in there is not official and is not a is not a is not official and is not a is not a is not official and is not a is not a valid communication mechanism. um in valid communication mechanism. um in valid communication mechanism. um in 2025 that that has to change. Nobody has 2025 that that has to change. Nobody has 2025 that that has to change. Nobody has an SLA on what on what they expect out an SLA on what on what they expect out an SLA on what on what they expect out of that, right? But having a community of that, right? But having a community of that, right? But having a community where you say this is the community where you say this is the community where you say this is the community slack. You can come in here. It's best slack. You can come in here. It's best slack. You can come in here. It's best effort. We're going to have all the CNAs effort. We're going to have all the CNAs effort. We're going to have all the CNAs in there. The board members can be in in there. The board members can be in in there. The board members can be in there if they want. But just a place there if they want. But just a place there if they want. But just a place that isn't deemed that isn't deemed that isn't deemed nonofficial would would be a great a nonofficial would would be a great a nonofficial would would be a great a great place. Um I I don't know what it great place. Um I I don't know what it great place. Um I I don't know what it takes to get that. And I know that some takes to get that. And I know that some takes to get that. And I know that some people at the program have when I've people at the program have when I've people at the program have when I've talked about it, they've been worried talked about it, they've been worried talked about it, they've been worried that it then puts some kind of onus on that it then puts some kind of onus on that it then puts some kind of onus on them to monitor and maintain it. Uh them to monitor and maintain it. Uh them to monitor and maintain it. Uh which I don't think it does. But on the which I don't think it does. But on the which I don't think it does. But on the other hand, they do use it to make other hand, they do use it to make other hand, they do use it to make public announcements, which has always public announcements, which has always public announcements, which has always been been kind of up in the air to me. been been kind of up in the air to me. been been kind of up in the air to me. Uh we need to increase our community Uh we need to increase our community Uh we need to increase our community involvement. I I went back and looked involvement. I I went back and looked involvement. I I went back and looked the CVE program. RVD has not been at RSA the CVE program. RVD has not been at RSA the CVE program. RVD has not been at RSA our black hat that I could tell for the our black hat that I could tell for the our black hat that I could tell for the last five plus years. That was just a last five plus years. That was just a last five plus years. That was just a quick quick look. Right. quick quick look. Right. quick quick look. Right. We have some questions in here. It looks We have some questions in here. It looks We have some questions in here. It looks like could you provide links to the like could you provide links to the like could you provide links to the Slack channel etc. Yeah, I I will I will Slack channel etc. Yeah, I I will I will Slack channel etc. Yeah, I I will I will add the link to the Slack um after the add the link to the Slack um after the add the link to the Slack um after the after the session. There's no longer one after the session. There's no longer one after the session. There's no longer one up here that I lost. Um there it is. Uh you were talking Um there it is. Uh you were talking Um there it is. Uh you were talking about validation process. Uh this about validation process. Uh this about validation process. Uh this questioner asked uh someone else another questioner asked uh someone else another questioner asked uh someone else another speaker yesterday about quality process speaker yesterday about quality process speaker yesterday about quality process and review about uh when a CNA signed and review about uh when a CNA signed and review about uh when a CNA signed CVE. Do you think this work should be CVE. Do you think this work should be CVE. Do you think this work should be done through an official quality done through an official quality done through an official quality documentation? I think that's in quotes. documentation? I think that's in quotes. documentation? I think that's in quotes. That will be mandatory for some That will be mandatory for some That will be mandatory for some requesting to be a CNA. Yeah. I I I I requesting to be a CNA. Yeah. I I I I requesting to be a CNA. Yeah. I I I I think think think that setting up a minimum quality for that setting up a minimum quality for that setting up a minimum quality for what your CBES look like is is a what your CBES look like is is a what your CBES look like is is a no-brainer. I mean, I I don't know how no-brainer. I mean, I I don't know how no-brainer. I mean, I I don't know how anybody can argue that we shouldn't have anybody can argue that we shouldn't have anybody can argue that we shouldn't have a minimum quality bar for there. The a minimum quality bar for there. The a minimum quality bar for there. The documentation is probably another issue. documentation is probably another issue. documentation is probably another issue. Um and we'll work on Um and we'll work on Um and we'll work on that. Uh onto education and training. Uh that. Uh onto education and training. Uh that. Uh onto education and training. Uh there should be certification for CNAs, there should be certification for CNAs, there should be certification for CNAs, right? Everybody loves to get a good right? Everybody loves to get a good right? Everybody loves to get a good certification. Um, and there should be certification. Um, and there should be certification. Um, and there should be certifications for the for the certifications for the for the certifications for the for the vulnerability data consumers, too, that vulnerability data consumers, too, that vulnerability data consumers, too, that said, "Hey, you've you've come in, said, "Hey, you've you've come in, said, "Hey, you've you've come in, you've taken a half a day class.

There are it's still only 450 people. There are it's still only 450 people. There are more than 450 people in the world who more than 450 people in the world who more than 450 people in the world who care about CVE data and using it. And to care about CVE data and using it. And to care about CVE data and using it. And to be completely honest, it still skews be completely honest, it still skews be completely honest, it still skews very very heavily to CNAs and to and to very very heavily to CNAs and to and to very very heavily to CNAs and to and to PERT teams, which I understand that PERT teams, which I understand that PERT teams, which I understand that that's the main environment, but you're that's the main environment, but you're that's the main environment, but you're not producing this data for the void. not producing this data for the void. not producing this data for the void. You're producing this data for companies You're producing this data for companies You're producing this data for companies to to use, for individuals to use, for to to use, for individuals to use, for to to use, for individuals to use, for academics to use. and we really need to academics to use. and we really need to academics to use. and we really need to lean into that group and to to make them lean into that group and to to make them lean into that group and to to make them feel welcome at these events and to take feel welcome at these events and to take feel welcome at these events and to take their their uh input and advice their their uh input and advice their their uh input and advice seriously. And then my last one is we seriously. And then my last one is we seriously. And then my last one is we need standardized reporting. I I know need standardized reporting. I I know need standardized reporting. I I know they have the the CNA enrichment list they have the the CNA enrichment list they have the the CNA enrichment list that that they list, but I I don't think that that they list, but I I don't think that that they list, but I I don't think that goes far enough. I really think that goes far enough. I really think that goes far enough. I really think that there should be quarterly public that there should be quarterly public that there should be quarterly public reporting that list every CNA, how many reporting that list every CNA, how many reporting that list every CNA, how many CVEes they put out, what fields they are CVEes they put out, what fields they are CVEes they put out, what fields they are filling in, and how. This wouldn't be to filling in, and how. This wouldn't be to filling in, and how. This wouldn't be to embarrass anybody. It would just be embarrass anybody. It would just be embarrass anybody. It would just be here's what the CNAs are publishing and here's what the CNAs are publishing and here's what the CNAs are publishing and here's the data they provide. Right? A here's the data they provide. Right? A here's the data they provide. Right? A public scorecard is never should never public scorecard is never should never public scorecard is never should never embarrass anybody. if you want, you embarrass anybody. if you want, you embarrass anybody. if you want, you know, I don't see why we why we don't go know, I don't see why we why we don't go know, I don't see why we why we don't go out and publish the stats as a CVE out and publish the stats as a CVE out and publish the stats as a CVE program more more openly. And even if program more more openly. And even if program more more openly. And even if you wanted to, even if you just wanted you wanted to, even if you just wanted you wanted to, even if you just wanted to send the reports to the CNAs directly to send the reports to the CNAs directly to send the reports to the CNAs directly for the first year or whatever, I'm more for the first year or whatever, I'm more for the first year or whatever, I'm more than willing to stand up and provide than willing to stand up and provide than willing to stand up and provide that data and and those scripts to run that data and and those scripts to run that data and and those scripts to run those. Scott, you have a question, I those. Scott, you have a question, I those. Scott, you have a question, I think. And with that, we'll just use the think. And with that, we'll just use the think. And with that, we'll just use the rest of the time for questions. so on. I I understand that, questions. so on. I I understand that, questions. so on. I I understand that, you know, CV doesn't want to push more you know, CV doesn't want to push more you know, CV doesn't want to push more regulations to push more people out regulations to push more people out regulations to push more people out because they want people submitting because they want people submitting because they want people submitting information, but how are you going to information, but how are you going to information, but how are you going to add how are they going to add more rules add how are they going to add more rules add how are they going to add more rules and regulations if the current rules and regulations if the current rules and regulations if the current rules aren't even enforced in the first place? aren't even enforced in the first place? aren't even enforced in the first place? That that is a good question. I would I That that is a good question. I would I That that is a good question. I would I think that the the start is to start think that the the start is to start think that the the start is to start enforcing the rules and to start being enforcing the rules and to start being enforcing the rules and to start being more strict on on solutions, right? more strict on on solutions, right? more strict on on solutions, right? like the the rules are so limited now. like the the rules are so limited now. like the the rules are so limited now. You have to start somewhere. And and I You have to start somewhere. And and I You have to start somewhere. And and I think that we we have to the program has think that we we have to the program has think that we we have to the program has to lean in and say we're going to get to lean in and say we're going to get to lean in and say we're going to get serious and here's what here's what serious and here's what here's what serious and here's what here's what we're going to do starting July 1st. we're going to do starting July 1st. we're going to do starting July 1st. Here's what we're going to do starting Here's what we're going to do starting Here's what we're going to do starting January. I don't think you can just do January. I don't think you can just do January. I don't think you can just do it all in one slope, but there does need it all in one slope, but there does need it all in one slope, but there does need to be a steady walk to adding more and to be a steady walk to adding more and to be a steady walk to adding more and more validation and credibility around more validation and credibility around more validation and credibility around around the data. around the data. around the data. And and I think that when when I talk And and I think that when when I talk And and I think that when when I talk about the quality of CBEEs, a lot of about the quality of CBEEs, a lot of about the quality of CBEEs, a lot of people think I'm talking about the junk people think I'm talking about the junk people think I'm talking about the junk CVEEs that that slide in a little bit. CVEEs that that slide in a little bit. CVEEs that that slide in a little bit. Those CVEes that I Those CVEes that I Those CVEes that I showed that I showed at the back at the showed that I showed at the back at the showed that I showed at the back at the beginning of the talk that were three or beginning of the talk that were three or beginning of the talk that were three or four words long, those are all four words long, those are all four words long, those are all considered super considered super considered super valid. like like nobody would say that valid. like like nobody would say that valid. like like nobody would say that these CVEes don't meet the minimum these CVEes don't meet the minimum these CVEes don't meet the minimum quality requirements for publication, quality requirements for publication, quality requirements for publication, but anybody who needs to use this data but anybody who needs to use this data but anybody who needs to use this data would say I I have no idea what to do to would say I I have no idea what to do to would say I I have no idea what to do to do with this data. Right? So, you have do with this data. Right? So, you have do with this data. Right? So, you have an elevation of privilege in in what an elevation of privilege in in what an elevation of privilege in in what product and what thing and what product and what thing and what product and what thing and what configuration, right? Like like those configuration, right? Like like those configuration, right? Like like those are the things that we need to get to are the things that we need to get to are the things that we need to get to even outside of CVEes that look like even outside of CVEes that look like even outside of CVEes that look like they're just in quotes junk. it it's the they're just in quotes junk. it it's the they're just in quotes junk. it it's the next level up of valid CVE records that next level up of valid CVE records that next level up of valid CVE records that offer little little usage. Uh we have offer little little usage. Uh we have offer little little usage. Uh we have one minute left. Does anybody have any one minute left. Does anybody have any one minute left. Does anybody have any further questions? Yes, because I love all the test I love all the ideas. Uh but it's test I love all the ideas. Uh but it's test I love all the ideas. Uh but it's always like you know what will happen always like you know what will happen always like you know what will happen with those ideas after this event. So with those ideas after this event. So with those ideas after this event. So I'm going to continue to go to every I'm going to continue to go to every I'm going to continue to go to every quality working group meeting and every quality working group meeting and every quality working group meeting and every automation working group meeting and automation working group meeting and automation working group meeting and continue to raise a fuss until they kick continue to raise a fuss until they kick continue to raise a fuss until they kick me out. Basically I I'm trying I I I am me out. Basically I I'm trying I I I am me out. Basically I I'm trying I I I am walking a fine line in between trying to walking a fine line in between trying to walking a fine line in between trying to be a good community member and be a good community member and be a good community member and productive community member and also productive community member and also productive community member and also pushing pushing people forward in in pushing pushing people forward in in pushing pushing people forward in in those groups. Right. Um, I'm not on the those groups. Right. Um, I'm not on the those groups. Right. Um, I'm not on the board, so I am I'm a level below where I board, so I am I'm a level below where I board, so I am I'm a level below where I have any direct say. Uh, but I'm seeing have any direct say. Uh, but I'm seeing have any direct say. Uh, but I'm seeing good movement from the board. I saw that good movement from the board. I saw that good movement from the board. I saw that they uh have paused CNA editions because they uh have paused CNA editions because they uh have paused CNA editions because we've added a bunch of CNAs who haven't we've added a bunch of CNAs who haven't we've added a bunch of CNAs who haven't published anything. So, so they're I published anything. So, so they're I published anything. So, so they're I think they're really starting to take think they're really starting to take think they're really starting to take CVE data quality seriously and and the CVE data quality seriously and and the CVE data quality seriously and and the growth of the program seriously, and I growth of the program seriously, and I growth of the program seriously, and I think that they're leaning into that, think that they're leaning into that, think that they're leaning into that, and I hope to see them continue to do and I hope to see them continue to do and I hope to see them continue to do that. Okay. So with that, I want to say thank you So with that, I want to say thank you So with that, I want to say thank you for everybody coming out. Once again, for everybody coming out. Once again, for everybody coming out. Once again, this wasn't supposed to be an open this wasn't supposed to be an open this wasn't supposed to be an open criticism of anybody. These are all criticism of anybody. These are all criticism of anybody. These are all ideas. I have bad ideas all the time. So ideas. I have bad ideas all the time. So ideas. I have bad ideas all the time. So if these were bad, please tell me if these were bad, please tell me if these were bad, please tell me afterwards. Or if you'd like to work on afterwards. Or if you'd like to work on afterwards. Or if you'd like to work on these ideas, please see me, too. I'm these ideas, please see me, too. I'm these ideas, please see me, too. I'm more than glad to help. And these are more than glad to help. And these are more than glad to help. And these are things I would like to see uh used in things I would like to see uh used in things I would like to see uh used in the program in the future because I the program in the future because I the program in the future because I really think that we could lean in and really think that we could lean in and really think that we could lean in and help create quality for everybody help create quality for everybody help create quality for everybody because I think at the end of the day because I think at the end of the day because I think at the end of the day CVE quality is just as important to the CVE quality is just as important to the CVE quality is just as important to the CNA as it is to the data consumers. So CNA as it is to the data consumers. So CNA as it is to the data consumers. So thank you guys very very much for your thank you guys very very much for your thank you guys very very much for your time today and and for listening to me time today and and for listening to me time today and and for listening to me on this topic.
