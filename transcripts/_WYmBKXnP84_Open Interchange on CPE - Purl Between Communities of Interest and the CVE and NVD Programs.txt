Kind: captions Language: en So, just warning you guys, FYI, Pete and So, just warning you guys, FYI, Pete and So, just warning you guys, FYI, Pete and I put tons of planning I put tons of planning I put tons of planning in into this in into this in into this discussion. Um, no, I think what we discussion. Um, no, I think what we discussion. Um, no, I think what we wanted to cover here today, and we're wanted to cover here today, and we're wanted to cover here today, and we're even missing somebody, I think, by the even missing somebody, I think, by the even missing somebody, I think, by the way. Um what we wanted to cover I think way. Um what we wanted to cover I think way. Um what we wanted to cover I think is is is uh we're doing a lot of work on software uh we're doing a lot of work on software uh we're doing a lot of work on software identification right now specifically identification right now specifically identification right now specifically what we just covered with CPE um I think what we just covered with CPE um I think what we just covered with CPE um I think the next big hurdle or next big thing the next big hurdle or next big thing the next big hurdle or next big thing that we're looking towards is Pearl um that we're looking towards is Pearl um that we're looking towards is Pearl um and how those might fit together um and and how those might fit together um and and how those might fit together um and maybe even some other software maybe even some other software maybe even some other software identifiers. I think we're looking for identifiers. I think we're looking for identifiers. I think we're looking for feedback from the community on feedback from the community on feedback from the community on um how to do some of this and how to um how to do some of this and how to um how to do some of this and how to make it the most useful to data make it the most useful to data make it the most useful to data consumers. And that is another thing I consumers. And that is another thing I consumers. And that is another thing I think there's a theme for a lot of us think there's a theme for a lot of us think there's a theme for a lot of us right now is that you know for a long right now is that you know for a long right now is that you know for a long time we've focused on the data producers time we've focused on the data producers time we've focused on the data producers and how they produce the data and what and how they produce the data and what and how they produce the data and what works for them. I think now for any of works for them. I think now for any of works for them. I think now for any of you that are in the audience that are you that are in the audience that are you that are in the audience that are data consumers, I think we're very data consumers, I think we're very data consumers, I think we're very interested in your points of view and interested in your points of view and interested in your points of view and what things are most useful for you. How what things are most useful for you. How what things are most useful for you. How do we implement Pearl and CPE and other do we implement Pearl and CPE and other do we implement Pearl and CPE and other software identifiers that we not even software identifiers that we not even software identifiers that we not even know about right now in the best way know about right now in the best way know about right now in the best way that works for for you? And how do we that works for for you? And how do we that works for for you? And how do we make it all work together? And that's make it all work together? And that's make it all work together? And that's how I think I would introduce this. how I think I would introduce this. how I think I would introduce this. Pete, you have anything to add? I I Pete, you have anything to add? I I Pete, you have anything to add? I I would I want to take the opposite end of would I want to take the opposite end of would I want to take the opposite end of the problem set which is people who are the problem set which is people who are the problem set which is people who are consuming the data are having a problem consuming the data are having a problem consuming the data are having a problem talking to their software talking to their software talking to their software provider and the challenge they are provider and the challenge they are provider and the challenge they are having having having is how do I know that I'm vulnerable or is how do I know that I'm vulnerable or is how do I know that I'm vulnerable or not? Because I have a scanner says I am not? Because I have a scanner says I am not? Because I have a scanner says I am and often the producer saying but that and often the producer saying but that and often the producer saying but that is fixed or you have the wrong is fixed or you have the wrong is fixed or you have the wrong version. And so we we have a a data version. And so we we have a a data version. And so we we have a a data problem. I'm not going to call it a data problem. I'm not going to call it a data problem. I'm not going to call it a data aggregation problem. We have a data aggregation problem. We have a data aggregation problem. We have a data classification problem that when you classification problem that when you classification problem that when you aggregate provides a real headache for aggregate provides a real headache for aggregate provides a real headache for all of us. So the challenge we're trying all of us. So the challenge we're trying all of us. So the challenge we're trying to get to is the utility of to get to is the utility of to get to is the utility of CPE. How do we extend for things that we CPE. How do we extend for things that we CPE. How do we extend for things that we hadn't had before? We don't own this, by hadn't had before? We don't own this, by hadn't had before? We don't own this, by the way. This is an MVD. the way. This is an MVD. the way. This is an MVD. Uh Tanya, it's by law. You guys have the Uh Tanya, it's by law. You guys have the Uh Tanya, it's by law. You guys have the CBE dictionary, correct? Yes. So, it's it's it's their correct? Yes. So, it's it's it's their correct? Yes. So, it's it's it's their their dictionary. And so, it's not like their dictionary. And so, it's not like their dictionary. And so, it's not like um we we own this dictionary. We're um we we own this dictionary. We're um we we own this dictionary. We're we're trying to contribute to the we're trying to contribute to the we're trying to contribute to the dictionary in a way that makes it useful dictionary in a way that makes it useful dictionary in a way that makes it useful within the dictionary uh within the dictionary uh within the dictionary uh confines and adaptability that MVD has. confines and adaptability that MVD has. confines and adaptability that MVD has. So we realize that we're coming at this So we realize that we're coming at this So we realize that we're coming at this kind of from the side and we're not here kind of from the side and we're not here kind of from the side and we're not here to overrun that. We're trying to to overrun that. We're trying to to overrun that. We're trying to help further refine that problem set so help further refine that problem set so help further refine that problem set so the consumer actually understands what the consumer actually understands what the consumer actually understands what they're looking at. And in some ways they're looking at. And in some ways they're looking at. And in some ways we're looking how to better describe we're looking how to better describe we're looking how to better describe vulnerable or not vulnerable because if vulnerable or not vulnerable because if vulnerable or not vulnerable because if you can't identify the you can't identify the you can't identify the components you're really in a creek and components you're really in a creek and components you're really in a creek and that means we have to extend past what that means we have to extend past what that means we have to extend past what was the proprietary uh uh approach. Not was the proprietary uh uh approach. Not was the proprietary uh uh approach. Not not that we don't have open source in not that we don't have open source in not that we don't have open source in that but we just don't have it well that but we just don't have it well that but we just don't have it well accounted for. And when folks I won't accounted for. And when folks I won't accounted for. And when folks I won't try not to talk as Red Hat too much. I try not to talk as Red Hat too much. I try not to talk as Red Hat too much. I have people who are actually experts in have people who are actually experts in have people who are actually experts in the room from Red Hat, um, Rogue and the room from Red Hat, um, Rogue and the room from Red Hat, um, Rogue and Martin for for starters. Um, but how do Martin for for starters. Um, but how do Martin for for starters. Um, but how do we overall as an industry do we overall as an industry do we overall as an industry do that? Because I hear customers really that? Because I hear customers really that? Because I hear customers really hollering and they can't read it. They hollering and they can't read it. They hollering and they can't read it. They don't understand when when we take don't understand when when we take don't understand when when we take something that was upstream fix and then something that was upstream fix and then something that was upstream fix and then we did something called a backboard and we did something called a backboard and we did something called a backboard and how does a scanner interpret that so a how does a scanner interpret that so a how does a scanner interpret that so a consumer sees it or how can a consumer consumer sees it or how can a consumer consumer sees it or how can a consumer see it directly or someone who's using see it directly or someone who's using see it directly or someone who's using it further downstream from us. So this it further downstream from us. So this it further downstream from us. So this is the the crux of the problem and this is the the crux of the problem and this is the the crux of the problem and this is a not an easy way to define because is a not an easy way to define because is a not an easy way to define because there's different approaches and we just there's different approaches and we just there's different approaches and we just name CPE and Pearl and you know there's name CPE and Pearl and you know there's name CPE and Pearl and you know there's probably a half a dozen other things you probably a half a dozen other things you probably a half a dozen other things you can add. Omnivore can add. Omnivore can add. Omnivore I tried not to use that word. I tried not to use that word. I tried not to use that word. We have an omnibore representative in We have an omnibore representative in We have an omnibore representative in the room as well. Andrew is here. the room as well. Andrew is here. the room as well. Andrew is here. I'm not going to speak for it. I'm gonna I'm not going to speak for it. I'm gonna I'm not going to speak for it. I'm gonna let Andrew talk to it. let Andrew talk to it. let Andrew talk to it. Yes. Yes. Yes. Hi. Oh, is it? Yeah. Um, I think one Hi. Oh, is it? Yeah. Um, I think one Hi. Oh, is it? Yeah. Um, I think one problem that I'm seeing is potentially problem that I'm seeing is potentially problem that I'm seeing is potentially there's no single source of truth. So, there's no single source of truth. So, there's no single source of truth. So, um, I had a chance to speak to some of um, I had a chance to speak to some of um, I had a chance to speak to some of the the the um the people at the booth in the room um the people at the booth in the room um the people at the booth in the room too and it seems like CPEs are the more too and it seems like CPEs are the more too and it seems like CPEs are the more common product identifier. Um and common product identifier. Um and common product identifier. Um and uh we know that organizations like uh we know that organizations like uh we know that organizations like Microsoft they they include CPEs in Microsoft they they include CPEs in Microsoft they they include CPEs in their own their own their own CVEEs but there are there are CVEEs but there are there are CVEEs but there are there are vulnerability scanners out there that vulnerability scanners out there that vulnerability scanners out there that create CPEs as well um create CPEs as well um create CPEs as well um for uh like published CVEEs. So it's not for uh like published CVEEs. So it's not for uh like published CVEEs. So it's not only now that CNA there are some CNAs only now that CNA there are some CNAs only now that CNA there are some CNAs creating their CPEs, vulnerability creating their CPEs, vulnerability creating their CPEs, vulnerability scanners are creating CPEs and then now scanners are creating CPEs and then now scanners are creating CPEs and then now we're introducing CPE applicability. So we're introducing CPE applicability. So we're introducing CPE applicability. So there's like multiple things that now there's like multiple things that now there's like multiple things that now vulnerability scanners have to be made vulnerability scanners have to be made vulnerability scanners have to be made aware of and they might not be made aware of and they might not be made aware of and they might not be made aware of. But shouldn't the CVE JSON aware of. But shouldn't the CVE JSON aware of. But shouldn't the CVE JSON files issued by CNAs be the single files issued by CNAs be the single files issued by CNAs be the single source of source of source of truth and vulnerability scanners use truth and vulnerability scanners use truth and vulnerability scanners use those as the um use the product those as the um use the product those as the um use the product identifiers there because surely CNAs identifiers there because surely CNAs identifiers there because surely CNAs should know the most about their own should know the most about their own should know the most about their own vulnerabilities and their own products vulnerabilities and their own products vulnerabilities and their own products so that customers can um identify so that customers can um identify so that customers can um identify vulnerabilities on their systems. vulnerabilities on their systems. vulnerabilities on their systems. That's a great question and and great That's a great question and and great That's a great question and and great observation and I think if you look at observation and I think if you look at observation and I think if you look at the CBE program and what we've done the CBE program and what we've done the CBE program and what we've done since 2016, we've federated the uh since 2016, we've federated the uh since 2016, we've federated the uh publication of CBE records. Um, and I publication of CBE records. Um, and I publication of CBE records. Um, and I think what what we're trying to do with think what what we're trying to do with think what what we're trying to do with CPE is, you know, before we gave the CPE is, you know, before we gave the CPE is, you know, before we gave the ability to CNAs to publish their own ability to CNAs to publish their own ability to CNAs to publish their own vulnerability data. Now we're giving vulnerability data. Now we're giving vulnerability data. Now we're giving them that ability to publish CPE data them that ability to publish CPE data them that ability to publish CPE data or, you know, standardized software or, you know, standardized software or, you know, standardized software identification because they're the ones identification because they're the ones identification because they're the ones that know the products, their own that know the products, their own that know the products, their own products best, and they're the ones that products best, and they're the ones that products best, and they're the ones that can that can represent that product can that can represent that product can that can represent that product information the best. We that that's information the best. We that that's information the best. We that that's just my opinion. Now, there may be some just my opinion. Now, there may be some just my opinion. Now, there may be some differences of opinion in the room. I I differences of opinion in the room. I I differences of opinion in the room. I I don't know. But um that's the way that I don't know. But um that's the way that I don't know. But um that's the way that I look at it. Pete, look at it. Pete, look at it. Pete, yeah, from a CVE board position, what yeah, from a CVE board position, what yeah, from a CVE board position, what we're trying to do is uh we believe that we're trying to do is uh we believe that we're trying to do is uh we believe that the CNA is authoritative source. Okay. the CNA is authoritative source. Okay. the CNA is authoritative source. Okay. You can go to our metrics page. You'll You can go to our metrics page. You'll You can go to our metrics page. You'll see it a couple of spots there on on see it a couple of spots there on on see it a couple of spots there on on CVE. This past year since VonCon last CVE. This past year since VonCon last CVE. This past year since VonCon last year actually uh we started evaluating year actually uh we started evaluating year actually uh we started evaluating the data that came in and we focused on the data that came in and we focused on the data that came in and we focused on four fields. There were C uh CVSS CWE um four fields. There were C uh CVSS CWE um four fields. There were C uh CVSS CWE um uh related fields. We're collecting CPE. uh related fields. We're collecting CPE. uh related fields. We're collecting CPE. We know that we have a We know that we have a We know that we have a deficit across the board. deficit across the board. deficit across the board. uh I look at it that if you look at a uh I look at it that if you look at a uh I look at it that if you look at a vone scanner assigned a vone scanner assigned a vone scanner assigned a CVE then the question I have is did the CVE then the question I have is did the CVE then the question I have is did the the upstream the person who owned that the upstream the person who owned that the upstream the person who owned that not take on that vulnerability because not take on that vulnerability because not take on that vulnerability because underneath the program let's say it's underneath the program let's say it's underneath the program let's say it's against Red Hat um that's in my scope against Red Hat um that's in my scope against Red Hat um that's in my scope our our purpose in doing that is every our our purpose in doing that is every our our purpose in doing that is every vulnerability gets an identifier vulnerability gets an identifier vulnerability gets an identifier They may not all be critical but they They may not all be critical but they They may not all be critical but they all will get an identifier and then that all will get an identifier and then that all will get an identifier and then that means we have to put the additional means we have to put the additional means we have to put the additional information in information in information in there. The problem then comes there. The problem then comes there. The problem then comes to being able to understand my to being able to understand my to being able to understand my code to what code to what code to what product and how do you identify it and product and how do you identify it and product and how do you identify it and that's where the system breaks for that's where the system breaks for that's where the system breaks for me. So that's that's the part where me. So that's that's the part where me. So that's that's the part where we're trying to get past is how do we do we're trying to get past is how do we do we're trying to get past is how do we do that? I see Ed's got his hand up and that? I see Ed's got his hand up and that? I see Ed's got his hand up and then we have another one over here for Shane. So our code also will provide CPE Shane. So our code also will provide CPE Shane. So our code also will provide CPE in the CV record JSON. So I think your in the CV record JSON. So I think your in the CV record JSON. So I think your question is a kind of out of order right question is a kind of out of order right question is a kind of out of order right because the scanner vendors provide CP because the scanner vendors provide CP because the scanner vendors provide CP because they're not presented in the CC because they're not presented in the CC because they're not presented in the CC CV record. If more vendor provide that CV record. If more vendor provide that CV record. If more vendor provide that they will copy that directly. So I don't they will copy that directly. So I don't they will copy that directly. So I don't think they will generate their own if think they will generate their own if think they will generate their own if they're already presented somewhere. She says yes and no. And it Yeah, we we'll evidently do some Yeah, we we'll evidently do some Yeah, we we'll evidently do some walking. walking. walking. You should be on the panel. Yeah. Oh, You should be on the panel. Yeah. Oh, You should be on the panel. Yeah. Oh, okay. okay. okay. Um Oh, thank you. Thank you. Um and I'm Um Oh, thank you. Thank you. Um and I'm Um Oh, thank you. Thank you. Um and I'm like CPEs I am quite passionate about. I like CPEs I am quite passionate about. I like CPEs I am quite passionate about. I actually presented on CPS just before actually presented on CPS just before actually presented on CPS just before this. Um but yes and no. Um Orca this. Um but yes and no. Um Orca this. Um but yes and no. Um Orca security we we use them. I'm from security we we use them. I'm from security we we use them. I'm from MongoDB. Um and uh we reached out to our MongoDB. Um and uh we reached out to our MongoDB. Um and uh we reached out to our vulnerability scanners to find out, you vulnerability scanners to find out, you vulnerability scanners to find out, you know, where are they getting their CPEs know, where are they getting their CPEs know, where are they getting their CPEs because if they're not being added into because if they're not being added into because if they're not being added into the JSON files by the CNAs, where are the JSON files by the CNAs, where are the JSON files by the CNAs, where are they go? Like who's who's providing that they go? Like who's who's providing that they go? Like who's who's providing that data? Especially since, you know, MVD is data? Especially since, you know, MVD is data? Especially since, you know, MVD is struggling with, you know, keeping up struggling with, you know, keeping up struggling with, you know, keeping up with bone enrichment. And you're right, with bone enrichment. And you're right, with bone enrichment. And you're right, we should be as CNAs be providing those we should be as CNAs be providing those we should be as CNAs be providing those product identifiers product identifiers product identifiers as not only a requirement just so that as not only a requirement just so that as not only a requirement just so that CV consumers know when or if or when or CV consumers know when or if or when or CV consumers know when or if or when or when not are they affected by the when not are they affected by the when not are they affected by the vulnerability. vulnerability. vulnerability. Now I don't know if Orca themselves they Now I don't know if Orca themselves they Now I don't know if Orca themselves they consolidate that information but I think consolidate that information but I think consolidate that information but I think you mentioned that CPA dictionary hasn't you mentioned that CPA dictionary hasn't you mentioned that CPA dictionary hasn't been updated for a while right so like been updated for a while right so like been updated for a while right so like is the information coming from the NVD is the information coming from the NVD is the information coming from the NVD APIs but it's now no longer present or APIs but it's now no longer present or APIs but it's now no longer present or are they really pulling those JSON files are they really pulling those JSON files are they really pulling those JSON files from CVE or from CVE or from CVE or so they do UCP for a long long so they do UCP for a long long so they do UCP for a long long So So So the MVD safety dictionary basically the the MVD safety dictionary basically the the MVD safety dictionary basically the single source of truth for a long time single source of truth for a long time single source of truth for a long time for a long time but we've now but for for a long time but we've now but for for a long time but we've now but for here I think the MVD should make a here I think the MVD should make a here I think the MVD should make a prediction do they want to copy the CP prediction do they want to copy the CP prediction do they want to copy the CP from the CVJSON record I don't think from the CVJSON record I don't think from the CVJSON record I don't think they make that commitment yet that means they make that commitment yet that means they make that commitment yet that means we'll make things more consistent we'll make things more consistent we'll make things more consistent between the CV record and CP dictionary between the CV record and CP dictionary between the CV record and CP dictionary Chris Turner is here we can ask him on Chris Turner is here we can ask him on Chris Turner is here we can ask him on Thursday because I thought. So your Thursday because I thought. So your Thursday because I thought. So your question is very ahead, right? We need question is very ahead, right? We need question is very ahead, right? We need multiple parties to get agreement. Yes. multiple parties to get agreement. Yes. multiple parties to get agreement. Yes. Yeah. So I'm just saying we need a Yeah. So I'm just saying we need a Yeah. So I'm just saying we need a single source of truth. Yeah. I I agree single source of truth. Yeah. I I agree single source of truth. Yeah. I I agree with that. And so uh I'm from Cisco. I with that. And so uh I'm from Cisco. I with that. And so uh I'm from Cisco. I work on the ESBOM management platform. work on the ESBOM management platform. work on the ESBOM management platform. Um and I'm in charge of testing SEA Um and I'm in charge of testing SEA Um and I'm in charge of testing SEA tools. So I've tested Net Rise, Anchor, tools. So I've tested Net Rise, Anchor, tools. So I've tested Net Rise, Anchor, BlackDuck, a number of other tools, and BlackDuck, a number of other tools, and BlackDuck, a number of other tools, and they do all add CPE data to their CVE they do all add CPE data to their CVE they do all add CPE data to their CVE records. They pretend like they're NVD records. They pretend like they're NVD records. They pretend like they're NVD and they add stuff. They enrich. In and they add stuff. They enrich. In and they add stuff. They enrich. In fact, Enkor now has a CVE enrichment fact, Enkor now has a CVE enrichment fact, Enkor now has a CVE enrichment feed that purports to solve the problem feed that purports to solve the problem feed that purports to solve the problem of NVD. Like you guys can go look it up of NVD. Like you guys can go look it up of NVD. Like you guys can go look it up and start feeding it in. Um because it's and start feeding it in. Um because it's and start feeding it in. Um because it's they open sourced it. So So the problem they open sourced it. So So the problem they open sourced it. So So the problem I have with most of those I know is um I have with most of those I know is um I have with most of those I know is um they don't follow the versioning very they don't follow the versioning very they don't follow the versioning very well. No. if they actually read our well. No. if they actually read our well. No. if they actually read our Sbombs and were taking those in. I Sbombs and were taking those in. I Sbombs and were taking those in. I haven't seen any of them who took an haven't seen any of them who took an haven't seen any of them who took an SBOM in yet. My folks can correct me if SBOM in yet. My folks can correct me if SBOM in yet. My folks can correct me if that's So, they're not taking that in. that's So, they're not taking that in. that's So, they're not taking that in. Then how do they know what are their Then how do they know what are their Then how do they know what are their components? And then how can they assign components? And then how can they assign components? And then how can they assign a a a CPE? And and my biggest challenge is if CPE? And and my biggest challenge is if CPE? And and my biggest challenge is if I'm rebasing or I'm backboarding, they I'm rebasing or I'm backboarding, they I'm rebasing or I'm backboarding, they certainly don't know what I'm doing. No, certainly don't know what I'm doing. No, certainly don't know what I'm doing. No, they don't. But they and I could, you they don't. But they and I could, you they don't. But they and I could, you know, ugly truth, we can get a component know, ugly truth, we can get a component know, ugly truth, we can get a component from from from upstream. I wait I can have five upstream. I wait I can have five upstream. I wait I can have five different backports for that. Okay. But different backports for that. Okay. But different backports for that. Okay. But you're from Red Hat. Redhead provides you're from Red Hat. Redhead provides you're from Red Hat. Redhead provides security advisors. Anchor pulls in security advisors. Anchor pulls in security advisors. Anchor pulls in RHSAs. They pull in, you know, Debian RHSAs. They pull in, you know, Debian RHSAs. They pull in, you know, Debian and Ubuntu security notices. Like, you and Ubuntu security notices. Like, you and Ubuntu security notices. Like, you know what? I' I'd say you're wrong, know what? I' I'd say you're wrong, know what? I' I'd say you're wrong, Anchor. Why would you say that? because Anchor. Why would you say that? because Anchor. Why would you say that? because they're put on an RHSA and they should they're put on an RHSA and they should they're put on an RHSA and they should be reading my VEX file because the RHSA be reading my VEX file because the RHSA be reading my VEX file because the RHSA is not detailed enough for what they is not detailed enough for what they is not detailed enough for what they need to do. Really? Yes. That's that's need to do. Really? Yes. That's that's need to do. Really? Yes. That's that's the real problem is I'm not going to the real problem is I'm not going to the real problem is I'm not going to name a vendor, but there's a vendor who name a vendor, but there's a vendor who name a vendor, but there's a vendor who pulls in our HSA. I can have five CBEs pulls in our HSA. I can have five CBEs pulls in our HSA. I can have five CBEs in there. One's a critical and the rest in there. One's a critical and the rest in there. One's a critical and the rest are moderate and they will call five of are moderate and they will call five of are moderate and they will call five of them critical. Now, how are you doing them critical. Now, how are you doing them critical. Now, how are you doing real service there? And and since you real service there? And and since you real service there? And and since you don't read the VEX file, you're saying don't read the VEX file, you're saying don't read the VEX file, you're saying that Red Hat is rescoring that Red Hat is rescoring that Red Hat is rescoring vulnerabilities based on its usage in vulnerabilities based on its usage in vulnerabilities based on its usage in its product. Yes. Interesting. So, and its product. Yes. Interesting. So, and its product. Yes. Interesting. So, and then you report VEX and vendors. Yeah. then you report VEX and vendors. Yeah. then you report VEX and vendors. Yeah. Our our severity levels based on how Our our severity levels based on how Our our severity levels based on how it's used in the product or how it's it's used in the product or how it's it's used in the product or how it's protecting the product. Okay. So, that protecting the product. Okay. So, that protecting the product. Okay. So, that that means we're changing the base that means we're changing the base that means we're changing the base score. So, we're not using CBSS as that score. So, we're not using CBSS as that score. So, we're not using CBSS as that harbinger of it. That's why sometimes we harbinger of it. That's why sometimes we harbinger of it. That's why sometimes we go back to MBD and say we need to go back to MBD and say we need to go back to MBD and say we need to rescore and here's why. But then we have rescore and here's why. But then we have rescore and here's why. But then we have to keep that on our website. But that to keep that on our website. But that to keep that on our website. But that doesn't mean that a scanning vendor will doesn't mean that a scanning vendor will doesn't mean that a scanning vendor will go back and read that. Okay? They'll go back and read that. Okay? They'll go back and read that. Okay? They'll want to pull an MBD score thinking want to pull an MBD score thinking want to pull an MBD score thinking that's the true. But they looked at it that's the true. But they looked at it that's the true. But they looked at it before with the rescore because you know before with the rescore because you know before with the rescore because you know this rescore process is not quick. So this rescore process is not quick. So this rescore process is not quick. So now you have a disparity in the ind in now you have a disparity in the ind in now you have a disparity in the ind in the information. That's true. And then the information. That's true. And then the information. That's true. And then there's EPSS. I would ask do you know if there's EPSS. I would ask do you know if there's EPSS. I would ask do you know if they consider EPSS has a hard time they consider EPSS has a hard time they consider EPSS has a hard time reading open source very well. Jane, I reading open source very well. Jane, I reading open source very well. Jane, I and Sasha have talked about that because and Sasha have talked about that because and Sasha have talked about that because I was a big believer trying to push that I was a big believer trying to push that I was a big believer trying to push that into Red Hat and I had to go back to my into Red Hat and I had to go back to my into Red Hat and I had to go back to my boss and say I have to eat my words. It boss and say I have to eat my words. It boss and say I have to eat my words. It was not a nice thing I had to do, but it was not a nice thing I had to do, but it was not a nice thing I had to do, but it was honest. Okay. Um yeah, my my comment was just that in Um yeah, my my comment was just that in Um yeah, my my comment was just that in consuming the CVE consuming the CVE consuming the CVE data, it's difficult to tell from a CVE data, it's difficult to tell from a CVE data, it's difficult to tell from a CVE record whether the CNA is the owner of record whether the CNA is the owner of record whether the CNA is the owner of the product or not, right? So we, you the product or not, right? So we, you the product or not, right? So we, you know, you generally you have like well know, you generally you have like well know, you generally you have like well some CNAs are research CNAs. They some CNAs are research CNAs. They some CNAs are research CNAs. They publish a CVE record. They obviously publish a CVE record. They obviously publish a CVE record. They obviously don't own the product. don't own the product. don't own the product. Some are vendors, they own the product, Some are vendors, they own the product, Some are vendors, they own the product, but it's not clear in the record. And but it's not clear in the record. And but it's not clear in the record. And sometimes the vendor scope is both. And sometimes the vendor scope is both. And sometimes the vendor scope is both. And so then I don't know whether they're so then I don't know whether they're so then I don't know whether they're claiming to be authoritative owners of claiming to be authoritative owners of claiming to be authoritative owners of the product that they're saying is the product that they're saying is the product that they're saying is affected. So I'll give you a a couple affected. So I'll give you a a couple affected. So I'll give you a a couple examples. Example number one, examples. Example number one, examples. Example number one, Colonel 731 CBES. What was it two and a Colonel 731 CBES. What was it two and a Colonel 731 CBES. What was it two and a half, three weeks ago? half, three weeks ago? half, three weeks ago? of that I don't remember the exact of that I don't remember the exact of that I don't remember the exact number. I think it was maybe 50 affected number. I think it was maybe 50 affected number. I think it was maybe 50 affected us. Now here's a problem in the system us. Now here's a problem in the system us. Now here's a problem in the system and as a root I'm I'm addressing this and as a root I'm I'm addressing this and as a root I'm I'm addressing this with the open source CNAs current. Well with the open source CNAs current. Well with the open source CNAs current. Well I know but you you got but there's two I I know but you you got but there's two I I know but you you got but there's two I forgot to say I also think that forgot to say I also think that forgot to say I also think that commercial and open source are commercial and open source are commercial and open source are different. So like if someone is like different. So like if someone is like different. So like if someone is like Microsoft like I own Microsoft Word I'm Microsoft like I own Microsoft Word I'm Microsoft like I own Microsoft Word I'm saying for sure I'm authoritative in saying for sure I'm authoritative in saying for sure I'm authoritative in Microsoft Word. Just having that would Microsoft Word. Just having that would Microsoft Word. Just having that would be useful for commercial open source is be useful for commercial open source is be useful for commercial open source is extra tricks you would say. Yeah, I I extra tricks you would say. Yeah, I I extra tricks you would say. Yeah, I I found that weird spot where one time I found that weird spot where one time I found that weird spot where one time I was I'm open source, another time I'm was I'm open source, another time I'm was I'm open source, another time I'm I'm I'm a proprietary and it depends I'm I'm a proprietary and it depends I'm I'm a proprietary and it depends on some government agency that has four on some government agency that has four on some government agency that has four letters that says I'm one or the other letters that says I'm one or the other letters that says I'm one or the other and therefore I'm excluded. I don't like and therefore I'm excluded. I don't like and therefore I'm excluded. I don't like that, right? I I look I'm on both sides that, right? I I look I'm on both sides that, right? I I look I'm on both sides of that coin. But the issue of that coin. But the issue of that coin. But the issue is when you take it from upstream and is when you take it from upstream and is when you take it from upstream and you touch it and you move it, it becomes you touch it and you move it, it becomes you touch it and you move it, it becomes a different problem set. So that's where a different problem set. So that's where a different problem set. So that's where the score has to be is is with the guy the score has to be is is with the guy the score has to be is is with the guy who moved it. So if Colonel's got one who moved it. So if Colonel's got one who moved it. So if Colonel's got one thing and I move it. Oh, by the way, thing and I move it. Oh, by the way, thing and I move it. Oh, by the way, when we have these open source when we have these open source when we have these open source discussions, uh, uh, CNAs, that includes discussions, uh, uh, CNAs, that includes discussions, uh, uh, CNAs, that includes Microsoft Microsoft Microsoft Azure, that includes Oracle Linux, that Azure, that includes Oracle Linux, that Azure, that includes Oracle Linux, that includes, you know, Debian, includes, you know, Debian, includes, you know, Debian, Abuntu, Canonicle, as well as Red Hat. Abuntu, Canonicle, as well as Red Hat. Abuntu, Canonicle, as well as Red Hat. So, you have to realize that we all have So, you have to realize that we all have So, you have to realize that we all have to modify it. If you go further down, to modify it. If you go further down, to modify it. If you go further down, everyone else is still doing something everyone else is still doing something everyone else is still doing something else to it. So there's the problem where else to it. So there's the problem where else to it. So there's the problem where Anchor is pulling something that's Anchor is pulling something that's Anchor is pulling something that's probably a kernel a CVSs. Greg would probably a kernel a CVSs. Greg would probably a kernel a CVSs. Greg would tell you, "Hey, I don't do CVS cuz I tell you, "Hey, I don't do CVS cuz I tell you, "Hey, I don't do CVS cuz I don't do anything that makes it use don't do anything that makes it use don't do anything that makes it use anything." You anything." You anything." You do. So here's a problem. Let me uh let me jump in real problem. Let me uh let me jump in real problem. Let me uh let me jump in real quick. Ed, I think you're arts boss, quick. Ed, I think you're arts boss, quick. Ed, I think you're arts boss, right? Um I've seen this issue in our uh right? Um I've seen this issue in our uh right? Um I've seen this issue in our uh in our issues list. So, I forgot to in our issues list. So, I forgot to in our issues list. So, I forgot to mention I I coordinate and chair the uh mention I I coordinate and chair the uh mention I I coordinate and chair the uh the quality working group for CBE. Um, the quality working group for CBE. Um, the quality working group for CBE. Um, and we do have an issue in that that Art and we do have an issue in that that Art and we do have an issue in that that Art put in um that talks about potentially put in um that talks about potentially put in um that talks about potentially having a property within the CVE record having a property within the CVE record having a property within the CVE record that defines whether it's the CNA is the that defines whether it's the CNA is the that defines whether it's the CNA is the authoritative source for this product or authoritative source for this product or authoritative source for this product or software. Um, so that is something that software. Um, so that is something that software. Um, so that is something that we're talking about adding at some we're talking about adding at some we're talking about adding at some point. Um, if anybody's interested in point. Um, if anybody's interested in point. Um, if anybody's interested in that or wants to talk about it more, that or wants to talk about it more, that or wants to talk about it more, that's that would be great. And even that's that would be great. And even that's that would be great. And even attending the QWG would be great as well attending the QWG would be great as well attending the QWG would be great as well if folks are interested. So, hit me up if folks are interested. So, hit me up if folks are interested. So, hit me up if you want to uh uh potentially become if you want to uh uh potentially become if you want to uh uh potentially become a member. Yeah. I just want to throw out a member. Yeah. I just want to throw out a member. Yeah. I just want to throw out that what I'm hearing is like the that what I'm hearing is like the that what I'm hearing is like the traditional sense of you have the code traditional sense of you have the code traditional sense of you have the code and you have a scanner that's assigning and you have a scanner that's assigning and you have a scanner that's assigning all this information. all this information. all this information. But I am a data scientist and I But I am a data scientist and I But I am a data scientist and I run a lot of tools and info gathering run a lot of tools and info gathering run a lot of tools and info gathering and we use anchor. I'm I'm not saying and we use anchor. I'm I'm not saying and we use anchor. I'm I'm not saying it's right or wrong. We use many it's right or wrong. We use many it's right or wrong. We use many different data sources and the problem different data sources and the problem different data sources and the problem is that is that is that um what you're suggesting requires that um what you're suggesting requires that um what you're suggesting requires that I have the code and my use case I have the code and my use case I have the code and my use case um I absolutely don't. I get a list of um I absolutely don't. I get a list of um I absolutely don't. I get a list of like poorly constructed sbombs and I like poorly constructed sbombs and I like poorly constructed sbombs and I have to guess what that is and make a have to guess what that is and make a have to guess what that is and make a mapping. And so for me that data is is mapping. And so for me that data is is mapping. And so for me that data is is useful. And so like I guess I'm trying useful. And so like I guess I'm trying useful. And so like I guess I'm trying to get my head around like I mean you're to get my head around like I mean you're to get my head around like I mean you're rescoring stuff but like and that's rescoring stuff but like and that's rescoring stuff but like and that's great you use your data and all of that great you use your data and all of that great you use your data and all of that but you know we also have huge but you know we also have huge but you know we also have huge information gaps and we got to fill them information gaps and we got to fill them information gaps and we got to fill them somehow. You're hitting the real somehow. You're hitting the real somehow. You're hitting the real problem. We have a data issue and how do problem. We have a data issue and how do problem. We have a data issue and how do we exchange that? I I'm not expecting we exchange that? I I'm not expecting we exchange that? I I'm not expecting any scanning vendor to actually uh read any scanning vendor to actually uh read any scanning vendor to actually uh read my my my SBOPS. I would encourage it. My boss SBOPS. I would encourage it. My boss SBOPS. I would encourage it. My boss expects it. I he and I have different expects it. I he and I have different expects it. I he and I have different expectations there. I do expect them to expectations there. I do expect them to expectations there. I do expect them to at least look at my VEX data because my at least look at my VEX data because my at least look at my VEX data because my VEX data, you will actually see where my VEX data, you will actually see where my VEX data, you will actually see where my CPEs and pearls are. And then you'll see CPEs and pearls are. And then you'll see CPEs and pearls are. And then you'll see when I amended the code and I did six when I amended the code and I did six when I amended the code and I did six variations off that same problem set. variations off that same problem set. variations off that same problem set. And that's very important for you as a And that's very important for you as a And that's very important for you as a data scientist because you're looking data scientist because you're looking data scientist because you're looking for that data. You want accuracy. So as for that data. You want accuracy. So as for that data. You want accuracy. So as it goes out our door, we're doing the it goes out our door, we're doing the it goes out our door, we're doing the Sbomb, but we're aligning that code back Sbomb, but we're aligning that code back Sbomb, but we're aligning that code back into V management. So our VEX keeps that into V management. So our VEX keeps that into V management. So our VEX keeps that same state. That's an important point same state. That's an important point same state. That's an important point there because you want to know the state there because you want to know the state there because you want to know the state of every issue as it changes. of every issue as it changes. of every issue as it changes. Yes. But how many vendors do VEX? Yes. But how many vendors do VEX? Yes. But how many vendors do VEX? They're going to No, seriously. We have They're going to No, seriously. We have They're going to No, seriously. We have and and Rogue and Martin can tell you. and and Rogue and Martin can tell you. and and Rogue and Martin can tell you. Uh Martin, you want to talk about people Uh Martin, you want to talk about people Uh Martin, you want to talk about people who are looking at our Vex and how who are looking at our Vex and how who are looking at our Vex and how they're moving from that? No. they're moving from that? No. they're moving from that? No. I'm putting them on the spot. Rogue. I'm putting them on the spot. Rogue. I'm putting them on the spot. Rogue. Hey, hey, hey, hold on, hold on. B's Hey, hey, hey, hold on, hold on. B's Hey, hey, hey, hold on, hold on. B's been waiting patiently for quite a been waiting patiently for quite a been waiting patiently for quite a while. Been waiting about 10 minutes. It while. Been waiting about 10 minutes. It while. Been waiting about 10 minutes. It seems you like you guys are pretty into seems you like you guys are pretty into seems you like you guys are pretty into this topic, but I got only a couple this topic, but I got only a couple this topic, but I got only a couple points to make. Thank god I got out points to make. Thank god I got out points to make. Thank god I got out vulnerability scanning years ago. Uh the vulnerability scanning years ago. Uh the vulnerability scanning years ago. Uh the other point is how the hell you fill up other point is how the hell you fill up other point is how the hell you fill up your data pool? your data pool? your data pool? Where do you get all this data from? You Where do you get all this data from? You Where do you get all this data from? You mean you don't collect it? mean you don't collect it? mean you don't collect it? We do. Are you getting everything? We do. Are you getting everything? We do. Are you getting everything? I you know everything is you know define I you know everything is you know define I you know everything is you know define what everything what everything what everything define everything. define everything. define everything. Uh Bruce, you can you can talk to my two Uh Bruce, you can you can talk to my two Uh Bruce, you can you can talk to my two experts here, Martin and Rogue, about experts here, Martin and Rogue, about experts here, Martin and Rogue, about how we actually pull that in. Uh and and how we actually pull that in. Uh and and how we actually pull that in. Uh and and it's in the release stream, you know, as it's in the release stream, you know, as it's in the release stream, you know, as they're doing the build. So, we're they're doing the build. So, we're they're doing the build. So, we're pulling it right there. Well, I can pulling it right there. Well, I can pulling it right there. Well, I can guarantee you there's vendors out there guarantee you there's vendors out there guarantee you there's vendors out there that aren't contributing it. I didn't that aren't contributing it. I didn't that aren't contributing it. I didn't say everyone. I I don't I don't take say everyone. I I don't I don't take say everyone. I I don't I don't take care of the world, but if you want good care of the world, but if you want good care of the world, but if you want good stuff, we could sell it to you. Should I cover that question about Vex? Should I cover that question about Vex? Should I cover that question about Vex? Yes. Yeah. So uh we cooperate with many Yes. Yeah. So uh we cooperate with many Yes. Yeah. So uh we cooperate with many scanning vendors and um from month to scanning vendors and um from month to scanning vendors and um from month to month we see more uh feedback and month we see more uh feedback and month we see more uh feedback and questions from from them how to consume questions from from them how to consume questions from from them how to consume our data and they're asking for vex our data and they're asking for vex our data and they're asking for vex because we need some kind of level because we need some kind of level because we need some kind of level standardization and precision precise standardization and precision precise standardization and precision precise information what exactly it is what is information what exactly it is what is information what exactly it is what is the status that's why I pres I was the status that's why I pres I was the status that's why I pres I was presenting in the open UX approach where presenting in the open UX approach where presenting in the open UX approach where it will again improve the situation it will again improve the situation it will again improve the situation because you know right now anyone can because you know right now anyone can because you know right now anyone can produce produce produce sbombs and if we don't use the sbombs and if we don't use the sbombs and if we don't use the same connection through for example CPEs same connection through for example CPEs same connection through for example CPEs from sbomb in a vex and then also in in from sbomb in a vex and then also in in from sbomb in a vex and then also in in in the product identification what in the product identification what in the product identification what exactly it exactly it exactly it is it will be one big mess and if is it will be one big mess and if is it will be one big mess and if vendors like anhor other scanning vendors like anhor other scanning vendors like anhor other scanning vendors aquac so with exactly the same vendors aquac so with exactly the same vendors aquac so with exactly the same data data data not produce them by not produce them by not produce them by themsel that would be very big themsel that would be very big themsel that would be very big win. So our also provide that if you win. So our also provide that if you win. So our also provide that if you download our CEP documents so it has a download our CEP documents so it has a download our CEP documents so it has a vaccine information there both the vaccine information there both the vaccine information there both the CVs redhead also has it. Yeah. Yeah has CVs redhead also has it. Yeah. Yeah has CVs redhead also has it. Yeah. Yeah has it. Yeah. You know we need whatever we can get You know we need whatever we can get You know we need whatever we can get now. We can't you know Yeah. It's great. now. We can't you know Yeah. It's great. now. We can't you know Yeah. It's great. is coming in the future, but like for is coming in the future, but like for is coming in the future, but like for right now, we have to use ankor other right now, we have to use ankor other right now, we have to use ankor other things. And so we're we're staying tuned things. And so we're we're staying tuned things. And so we're we're staying tuned and we're excited and support the VEX, and we're excited and support the VEX, and we're excited and support the VEX, but I'm just saying it's it's not in but I'm just saying it's it's not in but I'm just saying it's it's not in place right now. So it is super place right now. So it is super place right now. So it is super challenging. Yeah. So CISA will be a ISO document, Yeah. So CISA will be a ISO document, Yeah. So CISA will be a ISO document, ISO standard. Hopefully we'll get more ISO standard. Hopefully we'll get more ISO standard. Hopefully we'll get more visibilities more vendors will adopt visibilities more vendors will adopt visibilities more vendors will adopt CF. So that's why they can provide vex. So do have a follow-up question for vex. So do have a follow-up question for vex. So do have a follow-up question for piece you know CVSS piece you know CVSS piece you know CVSS modification. I'm in the first CSS 6. So modification. I'm in the first CSS 6. So modification. I'm in the first CSS 6. So the six official position you don't need the six official position you don't need the six official position you don't need to change the baseboard. You don't need to change the baseboard. You don't need to change the baseboard. You don't need to modify the baseboard. You can't use to modify the baseboard. You can't use to modify the baseboard. You can't use environmental it's not base score having environmental it's not base score having environmental it's not base score having created that beast uh it's temporal created that beast uh it's temporal created that beast uh it's temporal really and and the problem is no one has really and and the problem is no one has really and and the problem is no one has actually done temporal for 3.1 so the actually done temporal for 3.1 so the actually done temporal for 3.1 so the question is in four and 4.1 we will be question is in four and 4.1 we will be question is in four and 4.1 we will be uh moving into that area and and that's uh moving into that area and and that's uh moving into that area and and that's where I think we have to change as an where I think we have to change as an where I think we have to change as an industry because everyone has always industry because everyone has always industry because everyone has always gone with the base score in three well gone with the base score in three well gone with the base score in three well one two three and 31 and that's wrong. one two three and 31 and that's wrong. one two three and 31 and that's wrong. We've been wrong since that was We've been wrong since that was We've been wrong since that was invented. Yeah, that's f hard truth, invented. Yeah, that's f hard truth, invented. Yeah, that's f hard truth, right? Nobody actually using Yeah. right? Nobody actually using Yeah. right? Nobody actually using Yeah. elementary and also not quite metrics, elementary and also not quite metrics, elementary and also not quite metrics, right? That that's where we've got to right? That that's where we've got to right? That that's where we've got to make a change because everyone's gotten make a change because everyone's gotten make a change because everyone's gotten used to base score. And you're right, used to base score. And you're right, used to base score. And you're right, it's supposed to be immutable. I it's supposed to be immutable. I it's supposed to be immutable. I remember when I said that word the first remember when I said that word the first remember when I said that word the first time in the SIG, uh, you know, it's time in the SIG, uh, you know, it's time in the SIG, uh, you know, it's supposed to be immutable and yet supposed to be immutable and yet supposed to be immutable and yet everyone has has made it more temporal everyone has has made it more temporal everyone has has made it more temporal than it should be. So, okay, we're than it should be. So, okay, we're than it should be. So, okay, we're maturing. We're going to get that, but maturing. We're going to get that, but maturing. We're going to get that, but we have to start with VEX somewhere. And we have to start with VEX somewhere. And we have to start with VEX somewhere. And the question that you're going to see on the question that you're going to see on the question that you're going to see on Thursday in the BAF is false Thursday in the BAF is false Thursday in the BAF is false positives. What do we as an industry do positives. What do we as an industry do positives. What do we as an industry do to work with security to work with security to work with security vendors and help vendors and help vendors and help them? That's that's going to be the open them? That's that's going to be the open them? That's that's going to be the open question for Thursday afternoon. question for Thursday afternoon. question for Thursday afternoon. I have a quick question about what you I have a quick question about what you I have a quick question about what you just said that was intriguing to me. Why just said that was intriguing to me. Why just said that was intriguing to me. Why do you think temporal temporality is a do you think temporal temporality is a do you think temporal temporality is a problem? Why do you think that we should problem? Why do you think that we should problem? Why do you think that we should not make not make not make exploitability part of the score? And exploitability part of the score? And exploitability part of the score? And that's very temporal. that's very temporal. that's very temporal. So you have the base score. The question So you have the base score. The question So you have the base score. The question is should we also be doing a temporal is should we also be doing a temporal is should we also be doing a temporal score? Yeah. Because that's where the score? Yeah. Because that's where the score? Yeah. Because that's where the exploitability is and that's where exploitability is and that's where exploitability is and that's where actually patching and other actually patching and other actually patching and other configuration uh mitigations should be configuration uh mitigations should be configuration uh mitigations should be at. That's in the temporal score, not in at. That's in the temporal score, not in at. That's in the temporal score, not in the base score. But over time, the base score. But over time, the base score. But over time, everyone's used the base score everyone's used the base score everyone's used the base score solely. And the question is, well, if solely. And the question is, well, if solely. And the question is, well, if it's being used differently, why didn't it's being used differently, why didn't it's being used differently, why didn't we do a temporal? But everyone only has we do a temporal? But everyone only has we do a temporal? But everyone only has allowed and coded for that one score, allowed and coded for that one score, allowed and coded for that one score, which is the problem. Well, why do you which is the problem. Well, why do you which is the problem. Well, why do you say people have gone more temporal than say people have gone more temporal than say people have gone more temporal than they should have? Why did you mean by they should have? Why did you mean by they should have? Why did you mean by that? Because when we did CBSS V1 and we that? Because when we did CBSS V1 and we that? Because when we did CBSS V1 and we made a base temporal and environmental made a base temporal and environmental made a base temporal and environmental just because they were four point 5 just because they were four point 5 just because they were four point 5 point 10point and then search CC with 20 point 10point and then search CC with 20 point 10point and then search CC with 20 to 180 scales and we're looking for a to 180 scales and we're looking for a to 180 scales and we're looking for a common way to do it. So we made base as common way to do it. So we made base as common way to do it. So we made base as a way to say this is the immutable score a way to say this is the immutable score a way to say this is the immutable score and we thought everyone would do and we thought everyone would do and we thought everyone would do temporal themselves and environmental temporal themselves and environmental temporal themselves and environmental themselves. The security industry didn't themselves. The security industry didn't themselves. The security industry didn't pick up on the temporal part. pick up on the temporal part. pick up on the temporal part. the customer didn't do uh environmental the customer didn't do uh environmental the customer didn't do uh environmental part and so everything reverted back to part and so everything reverted back to part and so everything reverted back to the the quote immutable base score and the the quote immutable base score and the the quote immutable base score and that's where we went wrong. We we didn't that's where we went wrong. We we didn't that's where we went wrong. We we didn't enforce that because we're looking for enforce that because we're looking for enforce that because we're looking for adoption adoption adoption and that was you know retrospect almost and that was you know retrospect almost and that was you know retrospect almost 20 years I'm going oh we we missed the 20 years I'm going oh we we missed the 20 years I'm going oh we we missed the we missed the opportunity I had to clean we missed the opportunity I had to clean we missed the opportunity I had to clean that one up. So Red Hat is doing the in that one up. So Red Hat is doing the in that one up. So Red Hat is doing the in between thing which is providing the between thing which is providing the between thing which is providing the like running on with score. So when we like running on with score. So when we like running on with score. So when we score it, okay, we actually rescore the score it, okay, we actually rescore the score it, okay, we actually rescore the base score to make sure it's correct base score to make sure it's correct base score to make sure it's correct because not everyone looks at that and because not everyone looks at that and because not everyone looks at that and understands it. And then we do a understands it. And then we do a understands it. And then we do a severity severity severity score, by the way. So does like Rahu and score, by the way. So does like Rahu and score, by the way. So does like Rahu and Microsoft. And that severity score is Microsoft. And that severity score is Microsoft. And that severity score is what we do as to whether or not we what we do as to whether or not we what we do as to whether or not we prioritize a fix. prioritize a fix. prioritize a fix. So notice that we're not using CVSS to So notice that we're not using CVSS to So notice that we're not using CVSS to say this is a fix or not. But you don't say this is a fix or not. But you don't say this is a fix or not. But you don't put that information in security put that information in security put that information in security notices. Why not? It's on our website notices. Why not? It's on our website notices. Why not? It's on our website already. Okay. So in our life cycle say already. Okay. So in our life cycle say already. Okay. So in our life cycle say we will fix all critical and important we will fix all critical and important we will fix all critical and important right and kebs, right and kebs, right and kebs, right? But you don't it's not easy to right? But you don't it's not easy to right? But you don't it's not easy to find why you prioritize some fixes over find why you prioritize some fixes over find why you prioritize some fixes over others. Like you're you're not very others. Like you're you're not very others. Like you're you're not very transparent about no offense. Um yeah I transparent about no offense. Um yeah I transparent about no offense. Um yeah I we have lots of documentation blogs uh we have lots of documentation blogs uh we have lots of documentation blogs uh KBS uh presentations all on the net uh KBS uh presentations all on the net uh KBS uh presentations all on the net uh YouTube channels and we talk to YouTube channels and we talk to YouTube channels and we talk to customers about that all the time. It's customers about that all the time. It's customers about that all the time. It's it's right there on our severity page it's right there on our severity page it's right there on our severity page and I do read that page multiple times. and I do read that page multiple times. and I do read that page multiple times. It's very unclear how you basically map It's very unclear how you basically map It's very unclear how you basically map into that category in many into that category in many into that category in many times. You do have some times. You do have some times. You do have some secret formula somewhere to do that. I secret formula somewhere to do that. I secret formula somewhere to do that. I understand it. Yeah, because you have to understand it. Yeah, because you have to understand it. Yeah, because you have to get into the belly of the software. Um, get into the belly of the software. Um, get into the belly of the software. Um, but I think you'll see the changes in but I think you'll see the changes in but I think you'll see the changes in four CBSSV4 because the string will be four CBSSV4 because the string will be four CBSSV4 because the string will be different and it'll be more inclusive of different and it'll be more inclusive of different and it'll be more inclusive of the the the temporal. Sorry, I didn't make it about temporal. Sorry, I didn't make it about temporal. Sorry, I didn't make it about all red. Sorry. Stun silence. Sorry. Stun silence. Sorry. Stun silence. anything on discord yet? So what what are we trying to say yet? So what what are we trying to say yet? So what what are we trying to say here here here is CPE and the extension of CPE with is CPE and the extension of CPE with is CPE and the extension of CPE with whatever additional language so we can whatever additional language so we can whatever additional language so we can be specific about the be specific about the be specific about the component is the key to understanding component is the key to understanding component is the key to understanding whether or not you may be at risk or whether or not you may be at risk or whether or not you may be at risk or not. And then from a CVE perspective, not. And then from a CVE perspective, not. And then from a CVE perspective, it's how complete does that record have it's how complete does that record have it's how complete does that record have to be for a scene A to be to be for a scene A to be to be for a scene A to be authoritative. That's the recognition authoritative. That's the recognition authoritative. That's the recognition part we're trying to get part we're trying to get part we're trying to get to and and that's the scoring part we're to and and that's the scoring part we're to and and that's the scoring part we're trying to figure out because we don't trying to figure out because we don't trying to figure out because we don't know the the complete answer now. Go know the the complete answer now. Go know the the complete answer now. Go ahead, Christina, I can see that ahead, Christina, I can see that ahead, Christina, I can see that question. I mean, we don't have any question. I mean, we don't have any question. I mean, we don't have any representatives here from Abuntu. So, representatives here from Abuntu. So, representatives here from Abuntu. So, I'm just going to keep attacking Red I'm just going to keep attacking Red I'm just going to keep attacking Red Hat. No offense. I met some from someone Hat. No offense. I met some from someone Hat. No offense. I met some from someone from Canonical earlier, but he's not in from Canonical earlier, but he's not in from Canonical earlier, but he's not in the room. So, you know, that's right. We the room. So, you know, that's right. We the room. So, you know, that's right. We talk with them. talk with them. talk with them. Um so in the earlier discussion today uh Um so in the earlier discussion today uh Um so in the earlier discussion today uh someone from MITER was talking about you someone from MITER was talking about you someone from MITER was talking about you know the plan to potentially add pearls know the plan to potentially add pearls know the plan to potentially add pearls as an option to CDE records. Does Red as an option to CDE records. Does Red as an option to CDE records. Does Red Hat have any plans to adopt Pearls as Hat have any plans to adopt Pearls as Hat have any plans to adopt Pearls as like an additional identifier as sort of like an additional identifier as sort of like an additional identifier as sort of a like a nested identifier? I mean this a like a nested identifier? I mean this a like a nested identifier? I mean this this is the topic of this talk, right? this is the topic of this talk, right? this is the topic of this talk, right? The answer is yes. Okay. So, in your The answer is yes. Okay. So, in your The answer is yes. Okay. So, in your whether it's VEX or security notices, my whether it's VEX or security notices, my whether it's VEX or security notices, my voice is to like nest some pearls in voice is to like nest some pearls in voice is to like nest some pearls in there in addition to the CPE there in addition to the CPE there in addition to the CPE assignments. assignments. assignments. So, come to my talk tomorrow at 11. I So, come to my talk tomorrow at 11. I So, come to my talk tomorrow at 11. I explain all of this in detail. Um, but explain all of this in detail. Um, but explain all of this in detail. Um, but we do use CPEs. We use them as product we do use CPEs. We use them as product we do use CPEs. We use them as product identifiers, not really as component identifiers, not really as component identifiers, not really as component identifiers. We're actually still stuck identifiers. We're actually still stuck identifiers. We're actually still stuck on using the 2.2 version of CP. And then on using the 2.2 version of CP. And then on using the 2.2 version of CP. And then we use pearls for identifying we use pearls for identifying we use pearls for identifying components. So any soft piece of components. So any soft piece of components. So any soft piece of software that acts as a package software that acts as a package software that acts as a package component whatever it has its own pearl. component whatever it has its own pearl. component whatever it has its own pearl. So what you're saying is is that you So what you're saying is is that you So what you're saying is is that you will use a combination of CPE and Pearl. will use a combination of CPE and Pearl. will use a combination of CPE and Pearl. Yes. Yeah. Okay. We already do. Have Yes. Yeah. Okay. We already do. Have Yes. Yeah. Okay. We already do. Have been for a while. Will you be discussing been for a while. Will you be discussing been for a while. Will you be discussing at that talk how you are going to plan at that talk how you are going to plan at that talk how you are going to plan to identify version ranges etc using to identify version ranges etc using to identify version ranges etc using pro? I can. Okay. I'll add a slide for pro? I can. Okay. I'll add a slide for pro? I can. Okay. I'll add a slide for you. And Martin made a distinction there And Martin made a distinction there And Martin made a distinction there because people talking CPEs and products because people talking CPEs and products because people talking CPEs and products for for for CVEes. Notice that we like scoring CVEes. Notice that we like scoring CVEes. Notice that we like scoring components components components internally. So that's why there's Pearl. internally. So that's why there's Pearl. internally. So that's why there's Pearl. That's why we do both. That's why we do both. That's why we do both. Sorry, I do um I have a question over Sorry, I do um I have a question over Sorry, I do um I have a question over here. Well, I don't know if it's a here. Well, I don't know if it's a here. Well, I don't know if it's a question. So um uh MongoDB we are CNA question. So um uh MongoDB we are CNA question. So um uh MongoDB we are CNA and it's really helpful to hear how like and it's really helpful to hear how like and it's really helpful to hear how like Red Hat and other vulnerability scanners Red Hat and other vulnerability scanners Red Hat and other vulnerability scanners are you know utilizing CPS or pearls. are you know utilizing CPS or pearls. are you know utilizing CPS or pearls. The thing is we would like to know this The thing is we would like to know this The thing is we would like to know this as CNA so we can provide as much as CNA so we can provide as much as CNA so we can provide as much information as possible from the very information as possible from the very information as possible from the very beginning right so so that vulnerability beginning right so so that vulnerability beginning right so so that vulnerability scanners can read our scanners can read our scanners can read our CVEes as and making sure our con our CVEes as and making sure our con our CVEes as and making sure our con our customers and our users are you know customers and our users are you know customers and our users are you know being fixed for any issues. So is there being fixed for any issues. So is there being fixed for any issues. So is there going to be and I don't know if the CV going to be and I don't know if the CV going to be and I don't know if the CV program should be mandating this right program should be mandating this right program should be mandating this right but we need I guess there just needs to but we need I guess there just needs to but we need I guess there just needs to be guidance for like us the smaller CNAs be guidance for like us the smaller CNAs be guidance for like us the smaller CNAs who want to be you know helpful in the who want to be you know helpful in the who want to be you know helpful in the industry and provide the right industry and provide the right industry and provide the right information from the very beginning information from the very beginning information from the very beginning because um the number of CNAs being because um the number of CNAs being because um the number of CNAs being added every year it's just growing I added every year it's just growing I added every year it's just growing I think like in the last few years I think think like in the last few years I think think like in the last few years I think the number of CNAs being added will hit the number of CNAs being added will hit the number of CNAs being added will hit 100 by 202 end of 2025 77 yeah we're 44 100 by 202 end of 2025 77 yeah we're 44 100 by 202 end of 2025 77 yeah we're 44 447 but every year it's we haven't 447 but every year it's we haven't 447 but every year it's we haven't reached 100 yet in terms of per year and reached 100 yet in terms of per year and reached 100 yet in terms of per year and I think last year was 88 so this year I think last year was 88 so this year I think last year was 88 so this year will probably be 100 so that will bring will probably be 100 so that will bring will probably be 100 so that will bring that to 500 something right so um as new that to 500 something right so um as new that to 500 something right so um as new CNAs are being added that guidance CNAs are being added that guidance CNAs are being added that guidance should be provided right and I think I should be provided right and I think I should be provided right and I think I had to do a lot of dig digging in terms had to do a lot of dig digging in terms had to do a lot of dig digging in terms of finding out how vulnerability of finding out how vulnerability of finding out how vulnerability scanners use the CBES for scanners use the CBES for scanners use the CBES for identification sorry product identification sorry product identification sorry product identification right so so I think it's identification right so so I think it's identification right so so I think it's clear what the information that's clear what the information that's clear what the information that's required but I think what you're asking required but I think what you're asking required but I think what you're asking and what I'm hearing is is that you need and what I'm hearing is is that you need and what I'm hearing is is that you need better guidance better guidance better guidance on what's the the the recommended data on what's the the the recommended data on what's the the the recommended data that you should be providing and what we that you should be providing and what we that you should be providing and what we think would be best case for you right think would be best case for you right think would be best case for you right yeah and like what are vulnerability yeah and like what are vulnerability yeah and like what are vulnerability scanners doing in terms of because you scanners doing in terms of because you scanners doing in terms of because you know CP PPEs haven't been historically know CP PPEs haven't been historically know CP PPEs haven't been historically very well known and um they've not been very well known and um they've not been very well known and um they've not been added by CNAs themselves. So what are added by CNAs themselves. So what are added by CNAs themselves. So what are they doing? Um what sources are they they doing? Um what sources are they they doing? Um what sources are they using and what can CNAs be doing to help using and what can CNAs be doing to help using and what can CNAs be doing to help the vulnerability scanners? Because at the vulnerability scanners? Because at the vulnerability scanners? Because at the end of the day, we're all part of the end of the day, we're all part of the end of the day, we're all part of the same industry and we want to make the same industry and we want to make the same industry and we want to make sure that that you do the right thing. sure that that you do the right thing. sure that that you do the right thing. Yeah. Exactly. Yeah. I I think if you Yeah. Exactly. Yeah. I I think if you Yeah. Exactly. Yeah. I I think if you take a look at some of the SEA tools take a look at some of the SEA tools take a look at some of the SEA tools that are out there like SIFT, they just that are out there like SIFT, they just that are out there like SIFT, they just make it up on the spot, right? They look make it up on the spot, right? They look make it up on the spot, right? They look at the system, they observe it, they at the system, they observe it, they at the system, they observe it, they figure out some of the attributes of figure out some of the attributes of figure out some of the attributes of that of what they're looking at, and that of what they're looking at, and that of what they're looking at, and then they compile together an then they compile together an then they compile together an identifier, a CP, Pearl, whatever, identifier, a CP, Pearl, whatever, identifier, a CP, Pearl, whatever, right? That there is no other way for right? That there is no other way for right? That there is no other way for them to do this unless you actually them to do this unless you actually them to do this unless you actually attach the identity to the component attach the identity to the component attach the identity to the component that you're looking at. Then they have that you're looking at. Then they have that you're looking at. Then they have to make it out of thin air, right? to make it out of thin air, right? to make it out of thin air, right? So to make that better is essentially we So to make that better is essentially we So to make that better is essentially we all have to come to the same table and all have to come to the same table and all have to come to the same table and make sure that the way we use these make sure that the way we use these make sure that the way we use these identifiers is standardized across the identifiers is standardized across the identifiers is standardized across the industry. Right. The way I use Pearl and industry. Right. The way I use Pearl and industry. Right. The way I use Pearl and the way you use Pearl must be the same. the way you use Pearl must be the same. the way you use Pearl must be the same. Right. Exactly. And we actually Red Hat Right. Exactly. And we actually Red Hat Right. Exactly. And we actually Red Hat actually published uh a set of Pearl actually published uh a set of Pearl actually published uh a set of Pearl guidelines that literally outline in a guidelines that literally outline in a guidelines that literally outline in a very detailed manner of this is how we very detailed manner of this is how we very detailed manner of this is how we use Pearl for Red Hat specific use Pearl for Red Hat specific use Pearl for Red Hat specific components. So if it's an RPM, this is components. So if it's an RPM, this is components. So if it's an RPM, this is the qualifiers that we use. you can the qualifiers that we use. you can the qualifiers that we use. you can expect these values in it if it's a I expect these values in it if it's a I expect these values in it if it's a I don't know a Maven jar here's how we don't know a Maven jar here's how we don't know a Maven jar here's how we name it here is how we version it and name it here is how we version it and name it here is how we version it and all that right yeah and I but it's still all that right yeah and I but it's still all that right yeah and I but it's still not a very common identifier I think not a very common identifier I think not a very common identifier I think again I keep calling like pointing back again I keep calling like pointing back again I keep calling like pointing back to Andrew's talk from yesterday from uh to Andrew's talk from yesterday from uh to Andrew's talk from yesterday from uh Blackberry and I think he said that only Blackberry and I think he said that only Blackberry and I think he said that only two CBEs out there have pearls in them two CBEs out there have pearls in them two CBEs out there have pearls in them so it's Yes, providing guidance but also so it's Yes, providing guidance but also so it's Yes, providing guidance but also that standardization that structure that standardization that structure that standardization that structure needs to be there because otherwise you needs to be there because otherwise you needs to be there because otherwise you know we have all this data. Yes, we're know we have all this data. Yes, we're know we have all this data. Yes, we're you know you know other metadata like you know you know other metadata like you know you know other metadata like CVSS and CWES they're all being added CVSS and CWES they're all being added CVSS and CWES they're all being added into CVEEs but there's nothing to tie it into CVEEs but there's nothing to tie it into CVEEs but there's nothing to tie it to. You have that really good to. You have that really good to. You have that really good information out there but it's just information out there but it's just information out there but it's just floating. It's not tied to a product or floating. It's not tied to a product or floating. It's not tied to a product or a version. I think that's just a matter a version. I think that's just a matter a version. I think that's just a matter of getting the CNAs to do it right. of getting the CNAs to do it right. of getting the CNAs to do it right. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And so you you asked Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And so you you asked Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And so you you asked earlier like as a CNA as MongoDB, how earlier like as a CNA as MongoDB, how earlier like as a CNA as MongoDB, how can you make it easier for us downstream can you make it easier for us downstream can you make it easier for us downstream consumers to recognize your identity, consumers to recognize your identity, consumers to recognize your identity, right? Because I think Redhead does ship right? Because I think Redhead does ship right? Because I think Redhead does ship MongoDB as part of real. Yeah. Um and MongoDB as part of real. Yeah. Um and MongoDB as part of real. Yeah. Um and it's literally just like filling out the it's literally just like filling out the it's literally just like filling out the CVA records with correct and predictable CVA records with correct and predictable CVA records with correct and predictable information, right? Put put the right information, right? Put put the right information, right? Put put the right identifiers in there and things will identifiers in there and things will identifiers in there and things will just just work, right? Um that of course just just work, right? Um that of course just just work, right? Um that of course assumes that for example the CV records assumes that for example the CV records assumes that for example the CV records don't don't fully support pearls yet, don't don't fully support pearls yet, don't don't fully support pearls yet, right? So, we have to wait for that a right? So, we have to wait for that a right? So, we have to wait for that a little bit. They do support the CPE little bit. They do support the CPE little bit. They do support the CPE applicability statements. You know, you applicability statements. You know, you applicability statements. You know, you can start using those and that that'll can start using those and that that'll can start using those and that that'll improve it. But I I guess what we really improve it. But I I guess what we really improve it. But I I guess what we really just have to get away from is the CNAs just have to get away from is the CNAs just have to get away from is the CNAs that will publish a record and it'll that will publish a record and it'll that will publish a record and it'll have, you know, product equals NA. have, you know, product equals NA. have, you know, product equals NA. That's the big problem here. So, he's That's the big problem here. So, he's That's the big problem here. So, he's right and something I was going to add right and something I was going to add right and something I was going to add real quick. Sorry, Ro. um the CP real quick. Sorry, Ro. um the CP real quick. Sorry, Ro. um the CP applicability uh format that we talked applicability uh format that we talked applicability uh format that we talked about in the previous uh presentation. about in the previous uh presentation. about in the previous uh presentation. There is a a proposal in the QWG right There is a a proposal in the QWG right There is a a proposal in the QWG right now to use a very similar structure to now to use a very similar structure to now to use a very similar structure to support Pearl identifiers in a more support Pearl identifiers in a more support Pearl identifiers in a more official way using the applicability official way using the applicability official way using the applicability language. Um so that is another thing language. Um so that is another thing language. Um so that is another thing that QWG is currently working towards. that QWG is currently working towards. that QWG is currently working towards. Um so that could be coming down the Um so that could be coming down the Um so that could be coming down the road. Go ahead. Yeah. So like Martin road. Go ahead. Yeah. So like Martin road. Go ahead. Yeah. So like Martin said if you include as a CNA to your CD said if you include as a CNA to your CD said if you include as a CNA to your CD record information about your product by record information about your product by record information about your product by CPE right we will use it internally at CPE right we will use it internally at CPE right we will use it internally at rest then right now um very soon we will rest then right now um very soon we will rest then right now um very soon we will start adding CPE information and um start adding CPE information and um start adding CPE information and um other metadata to our for example other metadata to our for example other metadata to our for example container images. So scanning vendor who container images. So scanning vendor who container images. So scanning vendor who scan a container image with MongoDB we scan a container image with MongoDB we scan a container image with MongoDB we took from you will see that okay this is took from you will see that okay this is took from you will see that okay this is a component and associated CP ID is this a component and associated CP ID is this a component and associated CP ID is this one so I know what exactly it is and in one so I know what exactly it is and in one so I know what exactly it is and in this case they will know that they this case they will know that they this case they will know that they should use ARCP because this is the should use ARCP because this is the should use ARCP because this is the component that they are scanning and go component that they are scanning and go component that they are scanning and go to Red Hat CV record and in CEX to Red Hat CV record and in CEX to Red Hat CV record and in CEX advisories advisories advisories uh and they consume it from our side so uh and they consume it from our side so uh and they consume it from our side so they will know okay this is the status they will know okay this is the status they will know okay this is the status for this component that I'm scanning for this component that I'm scanning for this component that I'm scanning right now instead going right now instead going right now instead going to upstream data and using your CP ID to upstream data and using your CP ID to upstream data and using your CP ID that can bring incorrect information that can bring incorrect information that can bring incorrect information about the status because there could be about the status because there could be about the status because there could be a C CDE that affects MongoDB but the way a C CDE that affects MongoDB but the way a C CDE that affects MongoDB but the way how we use it in our component could be how we use it in our component could be how we use it in our component could be completely different story. So is it just providing the CP I like a So is it just providing the CP I like a So is it just providing the CP I like a string or are you saying we can just string or are you saying we can just string or are you saying we can just have fill in affected product and have fill in affected product and have fill in affected product and version as not in the CPE because you version as not in the CPE because you version as not in the CPE because you know you can uh list out the affected know you can uh list out the affected know you can uh list out the affected product and version just in the schema product and version just in the schema product and version just in the schema itself rather than providing the CPE. itself rather than providing the CPE. itself rather than providing the CPE. Does is that enough or do we h should we Does is that enough or do we h should we Does is that enough or do we h should we be send like adding those be send like adding those be send like adding those CPEs should be both? Both. Yeah, because CPEs should be both? Both. Yeah, because CPEs should be both? Both. Yeah, because if you're already filling in that if you're already filling in that if you're already filling in that section, you should be able to fill in section, you should be able to fill in section, you should be able to fill in the CPE, right? Yeah. And like as CPEs the CPE, right? Yeah. And like as CPEs the CPE, right? Yeah. And like as CPEs become more common, I think there's become more common, I think there's become more common, I think there's loads of people out there or loads of people out there or loads of people out there or organizations out there that have organizations out there that have organizations out there that have internal tools to develop CPEs for their internal tools to develop CPEs for their internal tools to develop CPEs for their products, right? based on the CVES that products, right? based on the CVES that products, right? based on the CVES that they've created, but because it's not they've created, but because it's not they've created, but because it's not commonly known in the industry, those commonly known in the industry, those commonly known in the industry, those tools aren't available for like our tools aren't available for like our tools aren't available for like our smaller CNAs who would love to be smaller CNAs who would love to be smaller CNAs who would love to be involved and you know involved and you know involved and you know um aren't really sure how to create a um aren't really sure how to create a um aren't really sure how to create a CPE themselves. I mean, it does take a CPE themselves. I mean, it does take a CPE themselves. I mean, it does take a little bit of learning to understand the little bit of learning to understand the little bit of learning to understand the schema, but yeah, I think it's just schema, but yeah, I think it's just schema, but yeah, I think it's just bringing that awareness. bringing that awareness. bringing that awareness. the the beginning and adoption takes the the beginning and adoption takes the the beginning and adoption takes some time but when you pass it then it's some time but when you pass it then it's some time but when you pass it then it's easy. easy. easy. Sure. So uh I've evaluated a lot of SCA Sure. So uh I've evaluated a lot of SCA Sure. So uh I've evaluated a lot of SCA tools um in my work at Cisco. I've been tools um in my work at Cisco. I've been tools um in my work at Cisco. I've been there for like six years and uh Cisco there for like six years and uh Cisco there for like six years and uh Cisco itself has had an ESB management itself has had an ESB management itself has had an ESB management platform based on SEA tools since 2014. platform based on SEA tools since 2014. platform based on SEA tools since 2014. Um I can't say a lot about those tools Um I can't say a lot about those tools Um I can't say a lot about those tools without like breaking NDAs but I can without like breaking NDAs but I can without like breaking NDAs but I can talk a little bit about how we have talk a little bit about how we have talk a little bit about how we have handled the naming problem internally. handled the naming problem internally. handled the naming problem internally. So seven years ago we started what's So seven years ago we started what's So seven years ago we started what's called alias service called alias service called alias service which had its flaws. It still has its which had its flaws. It still has its which had its flaws. It still has its flaws. Um but it was basically the idea flaws. Um but it was basically the idea flaws. Um but it was basically the idea that um there's always going to be that um there's always going to be that um there's always going to be different names for software packages on different names for software packages on different names for software packages on different platforms. And so in 2018 we different platforms. And so in 2018 we different platforms. And so in 2018 we created alias service to to map those created alias service to to map those created alias service to to map those names together to tie them together names together to tie them together names together to tie them together right as a sort of nested uh array of right as a sort of nested uh array of right as a sort of nested uh array of like how names are tied together across like how names are tied together across like how names are tied together across different platforms. NVD has its own different platforms. NVD has its own different platforms. NVD has its own name right has its own name. Those two name right has its own name. Those two name right has its own name. Those two things are tied together. So that was things are tied together. So that was things are tied together. So that was mostly for tracking for licensing mostly for tracking for licensing mostly for tracking for licensing purposes but somewhat also for CVE purposes but somewhat also for CVE purposes but somewhat also for CVE purposes. Um, and I think of and I'm purposes. Um, and I think of and I'm purposes. Um, and I think of and I'm going to talk about Ankor only because going to talk about Ankor only because going to talk about Ankor only because most of it is open sourced, right? You most of it is open sourced, right? You most of it is open sourced, right? You you all know that they have like 15 you all know that they have like 15 you all know that they have like 15 different feeds that are coming from, different feeds that are coming from, different feeds that are coming from, you know, different places and they're you know, different places and they're you know, different places and they're trying to tie all that data together. trying to tie all that data together. trying to tie all that data together. They have a similar idea. They have a similar idea. They have a similar idea. Um, but it it's sort of more open-ended Um, but it it's sort of more open-ended Um, but it it's sort of more open-ended in terms of like they can add pearls. in terms of like they can add pearls. in terms of like they can add pearls. They add lots of pearls to a lot of They add lots of pearls to a lot of They add lots of pearls to a lot of their what they call artifacts their what they call artifacts their what they call artifacts sometimes. Um, but you have to be very sometimes. Um, but you have to be very sometimes. Um, but you have to be very specific about where you want the feed specific about where you want the feed specific about where you want the feed to go to and which name you want to use to go to and which name you want to use to go to and which name you want to use on that feed. And I sort of imagined on that feed. And I sort of imagined on that feed. And I sort of imagined that if MITER could accomplish this, it that if MITER could accomplish this, it that if MITER could accomplish this, it would sort of look the same way. we'd would sort of look the same way. we'd would sort of look the same way. we'd have like a CPE name that was tied have like a CPE name that was tied have like a CPE name that was tied to pearls right together or whatever to pearls right together or whatever to pearls right together or whatever identifier like maybe I don't want to identifier like maybe I don't want to identifier like maybe I don't want to say the forbidden word of omnibore but say the forbidden word of omnibore but say the forbidden word of omnibore but like tied to you know artifacts that like tied to you know artifacts that like tied to you know artifacts that come from omnibore um in a sort of like come from omnibore um in a sort of like come from omnibore um in a sort of like parent child way as it as it goes down parent child way as it as it goes down parent child way as it as it goes down that's my personal suggestion based on that's my personal suggestion based on that's my personal suggestion based on my experience my experience my experience it's the CBE program not MITER show it's the CBE program not MITER show it's the CBE program not MITER show Sorry. Sure. Sure. Sorry. Sure. Sure. Sorry. Sure. Sure. I still don't understand how they're I still don't understand how they're I still don't understand how they're different honestly. Okay. So to give different honestly. Okay. So to give different honestly. Okay. So to give more information about CPS, we have more information about CPS, we have more information about CPS, we have using CP for a long time. So starting using CP for a long time. So starting using CP for a long time. So starting point the CP2 array. If you risk back point the CP2 array. If you risk back point the CP2 array. If you risk back using CP the string and you find out has using CP the string and you find out has using CP the string and you find out has many weakness in that string special many weakness in that string special many weakness in that string special characters versions cannot be actually characters versions cannot be actually characters versions cannot be actually addressed by that old standard. addressed by that old standard. addressed by that old standard. That's why NVD move from string to the That's why NVD move from string to the That's why NVD move from string to the JSON workaround. They put version JSON workaround. They put version JSON workaround. They put version ending, version starting this kind of ending, version starting this kind of ending, version starting this kind of thing to cover version thing to cover version thing to cover version ranges. So as a group we should push ranges. So as a group we should push ranges. So as a group we should push list to design the next version of CP. list to design the next version of CP. list to design the next version of CP. The CP23 basically totally out ofd The CP23 basically totally out ofd The CP23 basically totally out ofd cannot be cannot be cannot be used. So we should have some new modern used. So we should have some new modern used. So we should have some new modern schema like JSON based. So that's why we schema like JSON based. So that's why we schema like JSON based. So that's why we can do the mapping between CP to pro to can do the mapping between CP to pro to can do the mapping between CP to pro to other identifiers. You know the challenge of about trashing You know the challenge of about trashing You know the challenge of about trashing one and going the other is the crossover one and going the other is the crossover one and going the other is the crossover and cost of and cost of and cost of tooling. tooling. tooling. Um certainly an option but it would Um certainly an option but it would Um certainly an option but it would disrupt heavily. So the question really disrupt heavily. So the question really disrupt heavily. So the question really was how do we amend and grow it extend was how do we amend and grow it extend was how do we amend and grow it extend it to account for most of what we're it to account for most of what we're it to account for most of what we're doing. That was the approach from the doing. That was the approach from the doing. That was the approach from the CBE program about doing that. The CBE program about doing that. The CBE program about doing that. The difference is MITER is an FFRDC and has difference is MITER is an FFRDC and has difference is MITER is an FFRDC and has secretariat duties to the program and secretariat duties to the program and secretariat duties to the program and the program run by the board pushes out the program run by the board pushes out the program run by the board pushes out where we're trying to go. The question where we're trying to go. The question where we're trying to go. The question we're trying to figure out, we're both we're trying to figure out, we're both we're trying to figure out, we're both board members also, is what constitutes board members also, is what constitutes board members also, is what constitutes a CVE record. So Art's question a CVE record. So Art's question a CVE record. So Art's question yesterday was actually very appropo. yesterday was actually very appropo. yesterday was actually very appropo. What is a minimum record? Okay. Then What is a minimum record? Okay. Then What is a minimum record? Okay. Then what is an ideal what is an ideal what is an ideal record? I could envision at some point record? I could envision at some point record? I could envision at some point you could say, do we tier those CNAs or you could say, do we tier those CNAs or you could say, do we tier those CNAs or if you can't get there, you don't become if you can't get there, you don't become if you can't get there, you don't become a CNA, but you can get CBEES. a CNA, but you can get CBEES. a CNA, but you can get CBEES. Notice that's a change in thought Notice that's a change in thought Notice that's a change in thought process. So when I hear, you know, process. So when I hear, you know, process. So when I hear, you know, agencies talk about, well, we're agencies talk about, well, we're agencies talk about, well, we're recruiting. What are we recruiting? recruiting. What are we recruiting? recruiting. What are we recruiting? Another Another Another CNA. So what? Let's let's have CNA. So what? Let's let's have CNA. So what? Let's let's have quality. So it's about the record, not quality. So it's about the record, not quality. So it's about the record, not about the about the about the CNA. And that's a a thought process CNA. And that's a a thought process CNA. And that's a a thought process change we all need to think about is a change we all need to think about is a change we all need to think about is a CNA is a trusted entity who repeatedly CNA is a trusted entity who repeatedly CNA is a trusted entity who repeatedly does this. does this. does this. The question is define The question is define The question is define this and that's what we're trying to this and that's what we're trying to this and that's what we're trying to figure out. figure out. figure out. So the min requirement should be put So the min requirement should be put So the min requirement should be put into the JSON schema the required field into the JSON schema the required field into the JSON schema the required field right makes that very clear right if you right makes that very clear right if you right makes that very clear right if you submit record you should have this kind submit record you should have this kind submit record you should have this kind of field presented probably audited for of field presented probably audited for of field presented probably audited for the high qualities. Okay, there we go. So, I'm Andrew um Okay, there we go. So, I'm Andrew um Okay, there we go. So, I'm Andrew um with MITER uh part of the Omnibore core with MITER uh part of the Omnibore core with MITER uh part of the Omnibore core team and also the person who's formally team and also the person who's formally team and also the person who's formally submitted the proposals to add Pearl and submitted the proposals to add Pearl and submitted the proposals to add Pearl and Omnibore to the CVE record format. One Omnibore to the CVE record format. One Omnibore to the CVE record format. One thing I want to just make clear is that thing I want to just make clear is that thing I want to just make clear is that because I heard a couple times like because I heard a couple times like because I heard a couple times like ideas for improvement to CPE or to Pearl ideas for improvement to CPE or to Pearl ideas for improvement to CPE or to Pearl certainly, you know, always room for certainly, you know, always room for certainly, you know, always room for improvement, but I know with the improvement, but I know with the improvement, but I know with the QWG, the goal is not to workshop the QWG, the goal is not to workshop the QWG, the goal is not to workshop the identifier formats and make improvements identifier formats and make improvements identifier formats and make improvements to them. It's a question of use or not to them. It's a question of use or not to them. It's a question of use or not use. So where there's you know ideas of use. So where there's you know ideas of use. So where there's you know ideas of like oh CPE could be improved in various like oh CPE could be improved in various like oh CPE could be improved in various ways or where you know concerns with the ways or where you know concerns with the ways or where you know concerns with the state of 2.3 which was you know written state of 2.3 which was you know written state of 2.3 which was you know written quite a while ago those are all great quite a while ago those are all great quite a while ago those are all great but at least from the perspective of CVE but at least from the perspective of CVE but at least from the perspective of CVE like the the sort of boundary has been like the the sort of boundary has been like the the sort of boundary has been set to say look like CVE is not sort of set to say look like CVE is not sort of set to say look like CVE is not sort of reaching out like solving the identifier reaching out like solving the identifier reaching out like solving the identifier formats but is instead deciding does it formats but is instead deciding does it formats but is instead deciding does it make sense to add these to the record make sense to add these to the record make sense to add these to the record format so that they can be used for format so that they can be used for format so that they can be used for specifying uh the applicability specifying uh the applicability specifying uh the applicability constraints and sort of enabling cross constraints and sort of enabling cross constraints and sort of enabling cross referencing and like the other benefits. Were you going to answer that? Oh, no, Were you going to answer that? Oh, no, Were you going to answer that? Oh, no, no, I don't mean to dominate the I don't mean to dominate the I don't mean to dominate the conversation. I will say this. Um, and I conversation. I will say this. Um, and I conversation. I will say this. Um, and I think we it was talked about a little think we it was talked about a little think we it was talked about a little bit in the earlier session. And I think bit in the earlier session. And I think bit in the earlier session. And I think Omnibore does have value in that it sort Omnibore does have value in that it sort Omnibore does have value in that it sort of um does cover a space that Pearl does of um does cover a space that Pearl does of um does cover a space that Pearl does not cover. and and like you said, being not cover. and and like you said, being not cover. and and like you said, being able to add um vex documents that able to add um vex documents that able to add um vex documents that specify, you know, specific omnivore specify, you know, specific omnivore specify, you know, specific omnivore records that might be underneath a CP records that might be underneath a CP records that might be underneath a CP CPE record that that would be useful, CPE record that that would be useful, CPE record that that would be useful, you know, to say, well, this isn't in a you know, to say, well, this isn't in a you know, to say, well, this isn't in a package manager ecosystem, but this package manager ecosystem, but this package manager ecosystem, but this particular artifact has this score, you particular artifact has this score, you particular artifact has this score, you know, as is. I want to go back to something Martin I want to go back to something Martin I want to go back to something Martin spoke to spoke to spoke to is the CPE is more towards the application and we're using Pearl application and we're using Pearl application and we're using Pearl towards the components. towards the components. towards the components. CP can cover part of the it could. Yeah, CP can cover part of the it could. Yeah, CP can cover part of the it could. Yeah, CPE could cover both although Pearl CPE could cover both although Pearl CPE could cover both although Pearl seems to be more package module seems to be more package module seems to be more package module specific, right? Yeah. So the the the specific, right? Yeah. So the the the specific, right? Yeah. So the the the thing you have to think through there is thing you have to think through there is thing you have to think through there is where are we going to where are we going to where are we going to go? And that's more of an open go? And that's more of an open go? And that's more of an open question. I mean that's really what was question. I mean that's really what was question. I mean that's really what was just said is where do we go? That's what just said is where do we go? That's what just said is where do we go? That's what Martin was pointing to is we need to be Martin was pointing to is we need to be Martin was pointing to is we need to be standard. That that wasn't this is the standard. That that wasn't this is the standard. That that wasn't this is the standard. That is we need to be standard. That is we need to be standard. That is we need to be standard. We need to go there. If we all standard. We need to go there. If we all standard. We need to go there. If we all shift that shift that shift that way and become the way and become the way and become the standard, that really helps us move standard, that really helps us move standard, that really helps us move forward. And that's the the forward. And that's the the forward. And that's the the consideration we're trying to get you consideration we're trying to get you consideration we're trying to get you all to think through. I do have an observation that through. I do have an observation that through. I do have an observation that might lead to a question. Uh might lead to a question. Uh might lead to a question. Uh I observe that things are moving fast. I observe that things are moving fast. I observe that things are moving fast. Uh we were talking about CVE, now we're Uh we were talking about CVE, now we're Uh we were talking about CVE, now we're talking about CPE and then more and talking about CPE and then more and talking about CPE and then more and more. And then we talk about data as more. And then we talk about data as more. And then we talk about data as well. If the more data we well. If the more data we well. If the more data we have, the more uh correct information we have, the more uh correct information we have, the more uh correct information we have. So what the comm the community is So what the comm the community is So what the comm the community is doing to bring more data or more people doing to bring more data or more people doing to bring more data or more people to share the data because there are to share the data because there are to share the data because there are organization out there they are not organization out there they are not organization out there they are not willing to share the data. Uh last year willing to share the data. Uh last year willing to share the data. Uh last year uh there was one speaker from uh uh uh there was one speaker from uh uh uh there was one speaker from uh uh China talk about what China is doing to China talk about what China is doing to China talk about what China is doing to reinforce organization to provide the reinforce organization to provide the reinforce organization to provide the data to the the government not even to data to the the government not even to data to the the government not even to uh what NVD uh thinking about that or uh what NVD uh thinking about that or uh what NVD uh thinking about that or uh us as a comm a committee to bring uh us as a comm a committee to bring uh us as a comm a committee to bring more people and then to share more data. more people and then to share more data. more people and then to share more data. thinking about regulation. So, thinking about regulation. So, thinking about regulation. So, but I think what you do see is um like but I think what you do see is um like but I think what you do see is um like the lady from Mozilla, she's willing to the lady from Mozilla, she's willing to the lady from Mozilla, she's willing to share more data. She wants to know how share more data. She wants to know how share more data. She wants to know how best to do that. Um I think we need to best to do that. Um I think we need to best to do that. Um I think we need to on the QWG and with the CDE record on the QWG and with the CDE record on the QWG and with the CDE record format, we're trying find to find ways format, we're trying find to find ways format, we're trying find to find ways to facilitate that and to let people to facilitate that and to let people to facilitate that and to let people bring that data out in a way that makes bring that data out in a way that makes bring that data out in a way that makes the most sense for data consumers. So I the most sense for data consumers. So I the most sense for data consumers. So I think that's what all this boils down think that's what all this boils down think that's what all this boils down to. It goes to the question at the to. It goes to the question at the to. It goes to the question at the opening I asked. opening I asked. opening I asked. Okay, we say ecosystem but we haven't Okay, we say ecosystem but we haven't Okay, we say ecosystem but we haven't defined what that is or how we work defined what that is or how we work defined what that is or how we work together. And you're right, it's a data together. And you're right, it's a data together. And you're right, it's a data problem. We have a huge data problem. We have a huge data problem. We have a huge data issue. We have to figure out what pieces issue. We have to figure out what pieces issue. We have to figure out what pieces are are are required. And then how do we make those required. And then how do we make those required. And then how do we make those elements collaborate together? Not just elements collaborate together? Not just elements collaborate together? Not just communicate. we have to collaborate communicate. we have to collaborate communicate. we have to collaborate because if we're not all pulling that because if we're not all pulling that because if we're not all pulling that same same same outcome, it's going to be too disjointed outcome, it's going to be too disjointed outcome, it's going to be too disjointed and then we'll miss the opportunity of and then we'll miss the opportunity of and then we'll miss the opportunity of capturing a way to inform that scanning capturing a way to inform that scanning capturing a way to inform that scanning vendors can use to inform their vendors can use to inform their vendors can use to inform their customers which are our customers. So customers which are our customers. So customers which are our customers. So realize that has to be more realize that has to be more realize that has to be more symbiotic. So we we have to determine symbiotic. So we we have to determine symbiotic. So we we have to determine okay if CVE is the identifier just use okay if CVE is the identifier just use okay if CVE is the identifier just use that for the moment I know some people that for the moment I know some people that for the moment I know some people have other things they want to do but if have other things they want to do but if have other things they want to do but if that's identifier then what is a record okay for what is really important for okay for what is really important for okay for what is really important for the consumer if we can if we can the consumer if we can if we can the consumer if we can if we can minimally define that then we have minimally define that then we have minimally define that then we have something as Martin put to that we can something as Martin put to that we can something as Martin put to that we can standardize on that's what we don't have standardize on that's what we don't have standardize on that's what we don't have we don't have that standardization So, what we're going to do is kind of So, what we're going to do is kind of So, what we're going to do is kind of pick up for where we left off earlier pick up for where we left off earlier pick up for where we left off earlier before lunch. Those of us who got to before lunch. Those of us who got to before lunch. Those of us who got to eat, some of us gabbed for a while and eat, some of us gabbed for a while and eat, some of us gabbed for a while and we we we got I don't know, Slim Pickins would be got I don't know, Slim Pickins would be got I don't know, Slim Pickins would be a an over statement. We can't be that a an over statement. We can't be that a an over statement. We can't be that close together. Um, so what we want to close together. Um, so what we want to close together. Um, so what we want to do is some of the concepts we came out do is some of the concepts we came out do is some of the concepts we came out with in that discussion, we'd like to go with in that discussion, we'd like to go with in that discussion, we'd like to go ahead and capture some of those as ideas ahead and capture some of those as ideas ahead and capture some of those as ideas to to to consider. consider. consider. Um, and pardon me for some of the Um, and pardon me for some of the Um, and pardon me for some of the discussion we had Chris and I with some discussion we had Chris and I with some discussion we had Chris and I with some people who stuck around afterwards people who stuck around afterwards people who stuck around afterwards because they gave us some feedback uh because they gave us some feedback uh because they gave us some feedback uh about items we could do. So, I'm going about items we could do. So, I'm going about items we could do. So, I'm going to try to recap a couple items, not to to try to recap a couple items, not to to try to recap a couple items, not to be all-incclusive, just to start the be all-incclusive, just to start the be all-incclusive, just to start the conversation. conversation. conversation. And yes, we have mics for you guys to uh And yes, we have mics for you guys to uh And yes, we have mics for you guys to uh share. Last time we were short on mics. share. Last time we were short on mics. share. Last time we were short on mics. This time I think we have too This time I think we have too This time I think we have too many. We were talking about and CPE how many. We were talking about and CPE how many. We were talking about and CPE how we could extend CPE and how we could we could extend CPE and how we could we could extend CPE and how we could extend then for Pearl. The CPE part of extend then for Pearl. The CPE part of extend then for Pearl. The CPE part of the extension has already started. the the extension has already started. the the extension has already started. the quality work group and the automation quality work group and the automation quality work group and the automation work group are working hard with that work group are working hard with that work group are working hard with that and we're conversing with uh uh Chris and we're conversing with uh uh Chris and we're conversing with uh uh Chris Turner who's also representing uh NVD Turner who's also representing uh NVD Turner who's also representing uh NVD and NIST on the CDE board uh about that and NIST on the CDE board uh about that and NIST on the CDE board uh about that extension. One of the things we talked extension. One of the things we talked extension. One of the things we talked about and the concept is we all need to about and the concept is we all need to about and the concept is we all need to move in the same direction to get move in the same direction to get move in the same direction to get adoption. So the question would be or adoption. So the question would be or adoption. So the question would be or the statement I guess would be we want the statement I guess would be we want the statement I guess would be we want to move rapidly forward on extending to move rapidly forward on extending to move rapidly forward on extending CPE and then adding Pearl. So I think CPE and then adding Pearl. So I think CPE and then adding Pearl. So I think that's one of the outcomes that we would that's one of the outcomes that we would that's one of the outcomes that we would start with. Okay, Chris. Yep. And then start with. Okay, Chris. Yep. And then start with. Okay, Chris. Yep. And then what does it mean to to do that? That's what does it mean to to do that? That's what does it mean to to do that? That's going to be the big question past that. going to be the big question past that. going to be the big question past that. What's it mean to do that? Um and some What's it mean to do that? Um and some What's it mean to do that? Um and some of us have already started. Microsoft's of us have already started. Microsoft's of us have already started. Microsoft's done some things. Redhead's doing some done some things. Redhead's doing some done some things. Redhead's doing some things. I think uh MongoDB has some nice things. I think uh MongoDB has some nice things. I think uh MongoDB has some nice ideas. Uh she's not here right now. ideas. Uh she's not here right now. ideas. Uh she's not here right now. Hopefully she comes in a little bit. Hopefully she comes in a little bit. Hopefully she comes in a little bit. Some others have other Some others have other Some others have other ideas. The key because we actually had ideas. The key because we actually had ideas. The key because we actually had some vendors, security scanning vendors some vendors, security scanning vendors some vendors, security scanning vendors in the crowd is they're looking for a in the crowd is they're looking for a in the crowd is they're looking for a good aggregation good aggregation good aggregation point to pull from. Put it another Put it another Put it another way, maybe a little more blunt, is way, maybe a little more blunt, is way, maybe a little more blunt, is they're looking for an easy way to get they're looking for an easy way to get they're looking for an easy way to get the data and and stop the crisscross the data and and stop the crisscross the data and and stop the crisscross between customers, between customers, between customers, producers, and other vendors, security producers, and other vendors, security producers, and other vendors, security vendors. I think that's a fair way of vendors. I think that's a fair way of vendors. I think that's a fair way of putting putting putting it. So, how do we do it. So, how do we do it. So, how do we do that? The interesting point is I asked that? The interesting point is I asked that? The interesting point is I asked Tanya because Tanya Brewer from MVD was Tanya because Tanya Brewer from MVD was Tanya because Tanya Brewer from MVD was here, the director at MVD. Hey, is CPE here, the director at MVD. Hey, is CPE here, the director at MVD. Hey, is CPE dictionary required by dictionary required by dictionary required by law? To which I got a surprising answer, law? To which I got a surprising answer, law? To which I got a surprising answer, no. I went, "Oh, I thought that you told no. I went, "Oh, I thought that you told no. I went, "Oh, I thought that you told us last year." So, seems to me that us last year." So, seems to me that us last year." So, seems to me that maybe we're looking at this wrong about maybe we're looking at this wrong about maybe we're looking at this wrong about how we update that CPE dictionary. Not how we update that CPE dictionary. Not how we update that CPE dictionary. Not that I'm trying to supersede that I'm trying to supersede that I'm trying to supersede NVD, but from an ecosystem perspective, NVD, but from an ecosystem perspective, NVD, but from an ecosystem perspective, how do we make that how do we make that how do we make that work? Because the point of the problem work? Because the point of the problem work? Because the point of the problem right now everyone mentioned was we have right now everyone mentioned was we have right now everyone mentioned was we have a data a data a data problem and in that data problem we have problem and in that data problem we have problem and in that data problem we have a data format a data format a data format problem. How do we problem. How do we problem. How do we inform? So I'm using as an open premise inform? So I'm using as an open premise inform? So I'm using as an open premise and I can see you guys had all that food and I can see you guys had all that food and I can see you guys had all that food I missed because you're ready to go to I missed because you're ready to go to I missed because you're ready to go to sleep and not give me an answer which sleep and not give me an answer which sleep and not give me an answer which means I now have to call on you if you means I now have to call on you if you means I now have to call on you if you don't volunteer. don't volunteer. don't volunteer. So, anyone want to react to So, anyone want to react to So, anyone want to react to that? Christine, I'm counting on you. Hold on a second. We'll get that mic for Hold on a second. We'll get that mic for Hold on a second. We'll get that mic for gonna say we should have just recorded gonna say we should have just recorded gonna say we should have just recorded the previous session and put all that the previous session and put all that the previous session and put all that down on scratch pad just to start with down on scratch pad just to start with down on scratch pad just to start with this. So, um the gentleman uh who's from this. So, um the gentleman uh who's from this. So, um the gentleman uh who's from Oracle, his boss is here now. Oh, okay. Oracle, his boss is here now. Oh, okay. Oracle, his boss is here now. Oh, okay. Bruce is behind you. Bruce is behind you. Bruce is behind you. Hey, how's it going? So, uh, he he Hey, how's it going? So, uh, he he Hey, how's it going? So, uh, he he talked a little bit about the JSON talked a little bit about the JSON talked a little bit about the JSON format, and maybe this isn't the place format, and maybe this isn't the place format, and maybe this isn't the place to get into the nitty-gritty of the to get into the nitty-gritty of the to get into the nitty-gritty of the formatting that we do, but maybe it is formatting that we do, but maybe it is formatting that we do, but maybe it is the place to get into it. You know, you the place to get into it. You know, you the place to get into it. You know, you know, I talked about nesting data, but know, I talked about nesting data, but know, I talked about nesting data, but he actually had ideas on how you might he actually had ideas on how you might he actually had ideas on how you might nest that data in a JSON structure, how nest that data in a JSON structure, how nest that data in a JSON structure, how you would tie pearls to CPEs. Is that you would tie pearls to CPEs. Is that you would tie pearls to CPEs. Is that something something Let's record it. something something Let's record it. something something Let's record it. That's an idea. Okay. And I I want to That's an idea. Okay. And I I want to That's an idea. Okay. And I I want to let Bruce talk that in a second. Just let Bruce talk that in a second. Just let Bruce talk that in a second. Just just a second. The guy's name that did just a second. The guy's name that did just a second. The guy's name that did that is named Fung. I mispronounced it. that is named Fung. I mispronounced it. that is named Fung. I mispronounced it. Everybody mispronounced it. It's fun. Everybody mispronounced it. It's fun. Everybody mispronounced it. It's fun. And everybody says Fang because that's And everybody says Fang because that's And everybody says Fang because that's the way it looks in English. Okay. I the way it looks in English. Okay. I the way it looks in English. Okay. I just wanted to say that so you know I'm just wanted to say that so you know I'm just wanted to say that so you know I'm not the one that's I'm not saying he's not the one that's I'm not saying he's not the one that's I'm not saying he's long or anything. That's not I'm not I long or anything. That's not I'm not I long or anything. That's not I'm not I didn't promote that. That's me. That's didn't promote that. That's me. That's didn't promote that. That's me. That's okay. I I I think it's a good idea that okay. I I I think it's a good idea that okay. I I I think it's a good idea that we need to bring forward. um not not to we need to bring forward. um not not to we need to bring forward. um not not to try to solution it here. I think what try to solution it here. I think what try to solution it here. I think what we're trying to figure out is what are we're trying to figure out is what are we're trying to figure out is what are the approaches that we could consider the approaches that we could consider the approaches that we could consider and who might have those ideas for all and who might have those ideas for all and who might have those ideas for all of us to look at. of us to look at. of us to look at. I don't know that anyone has ever had I don't know that anyone has ever had I don't know that anyone has ever had that idea like solution from the ground that idea like solution from the ground that idea like solution from the ground up. Each person each vendor tries to up. Each person each vendor tries to up. Each person each vendor tries to create their own internal solution and create their own internal solution and create their own internal solution and they all have different formats they all have different formats they all have different formats internally that they try to then tie to internally that they try to then tie to internally that they try to then tie to external formats because there is no one external formats because there is no one external formats because there is no one point. No, there there isn't. And that's point. No, there there isn't. And that's point. No, there there isn't. And that's why I looked at we need to bring them why I looked at we need to bring them why I looked at we need to bring them forward because uh I know uh Microsoft forward because uh I know uh Microsoft forward because uh I know uh Microsoft has brought forward what they're doing. has brought forward what they're doing. has brought forward what they're doing. I know that uh Red Hat we've taken our I know that uh Red Hat we've taken our I know that uh Red Hat we've taken our stuff forward. Uh I don't I'm not going stuff forward. Uh I don't I'm not going stuff forward. Uh I don't I'm not going to claim any any one of us has quote the to claim any any one of us has quote the to claim any any one of us has quote the answer. We have starting points and and answer. We have starting points and and answer. We have starting points and and where is the commonality? I think where is the commonality? I think where is the commonality? I think commonality is key because it's faster commonality is key because it's faster commonality is key because it's faster to adoption and as someone uh postulated to adoption and as someone uh postulated to adoption and as someone uh postulated in the last uh session in the last uh session in the last uh session um do we start over and I think the um do we start over and I think the um do we start over and I think the problem with start over is it's like problem with start over is it's like problem with start over is it's like okay two to three years to kind of get okay two to three years to kind of get okay two to three years to kind of get anything and then another two years to anything and then another two years to anything and then another two years to get adoption and by the way all the get adoption and by the way all the get adoption and by the way all the tooling we'd all have to do. I'd rather tooling we'd all have to do. I'd rather tooling we'd all have to do. I'd rather extend, if possible, what's already extend, if possible, what's already extend, if possible, what's already existent and amend what our differences existent and amend what our differences existent and amend what our differences are that we could make it more broad, more broad, more broad, acceptable. I don't know what that acceptable. I don't know what that acceptable. I don't know what that trade-off is. That that's a conversation trade-off is. That that's a conversation trade-off is. That that's a conversation that's going to have to take place, I that's going to have to take place, I that's going to have to take place, I think, in in technical terms about how think, in in technical terms about how think, in in technical terms about how we do that. we do that. we do that. Well, there's a good question. What is Well, there's a good question. What is Well, there's a good question. What is Red Hat doing internally? like what what Red Hat doing internally? like what what Red Hat doing internally? like what what do your formats look like? do your formats look like? do your formats look like? So, uh actually Martin is presenting on So, uh actually Martin is presenting on So, uh actually Martin is presenting on uh some of that uh this afternoon. So, I uh some of that uh this afternoon. So, I uh some of that uh this afternoon. So, I want to ask you to go and see him. But want to ask you to go and see him. But want to ask you to go and see him. But like he said earlier, we use CPE at the like he said earlier, we use CPE at the like he said earlier, we use CPE at the application level, but we use Pearl at application level, but we use Pearl at application level, but we use Pearl at the component level. So, you have to the component level. So, you have to the component level. So, you have to realize we probably do realize we probably do realize we probably do uh we probably do a little different. We uh we probably do a little different. We uh we probably do a little different. We didn't mean to be different. It's just didn't mean to be different. It's just didn't mean to be different. It's just what we do. what we do. what we do. um when we assign a CVE we actually go um when we assign a CVE we actually go um when we assign a CVE we actually go to the component and then we search for to the component and then we search for to the component and then we search for where the component is in the where the component is in the where the component is in the applications and then where the applications and then where the applications and then where the dependencies are where it's stacked dependencies are where it's stacked dependencies are where it's stacked above that. So internally we look at above that. So internally we look at above that. So internally we look at components components components externally because everyone talks externally because everyone talks externally because everyone talks applications to CVEEs because that's the applications to CVEEs because that's the applications to CVEEs because that's the way they saw everyone else. We translate way they saw everyone else. We translate way they saw everyone else. We translate that across for people to do that. But that across for people to do that. But that across for people to do that. But if you look at our VEX file, it'll if you look at our VEX file, it'll if you look at our VEX file, it'll contain both the CPE the application contain both the CPE the application contain both the CPE the application level and then the uh Pearl down to the level and then the uh Pearl down to the level and then the uh Pearl down to the component level and they both have the component level and they both have the component level and they both have the CVE. Um I have a question because I feel CVE. Um I have a question because I feel CVE. Um I have a question because I feel like we're not talking apples to apples like we're not talking apples to apples like we're not talking apples to apples when you say components. When you say when you say components. When you say when you say components. When you say packages upstream yeah packages. See packages upstream yeah packages. See packages upstream yeah packages. See when you say components you mean when you say components you mean when you say components you mean packages but when um say Cisco says packages but when um say Cisco says packages but when um say Cisco says components um we mean you know components um we mean you know components um we mean you know applications or can mean both. So okay applications or can mean both. So okay applications or can mean both. So okay there's a a point we need to put on the there's a a point we need to put on the there's a a point we need to put on the scratch pad is make sure that we're scratch pad is make sure that we're scratch pad is make sure that we're using the definition similarly or at using the definition similarly or at using the definition similarly or at least we know when we're translating least we know when we're translating least we know when we're translating back across. Bruce. So the there's a back across. Bruce. So the there's a back across. Bruce. So the there's a fundamental there's a number of problems fundamental there's a number of problems fundamental there's a number of problems and it would be good to put them down and it would be good to put them down and it would be good to put them down somewhere so people can start thinking somewhere so people can start thinking somewhere so people can start thinking about them because people come and do about them because people come and do about them because people come and do I'll answer this. I'll address your I'll answer this. I'll address your I'll answer this. I'll address your issue but I wanted to bring up something issue but I wanted to bring up something issue but I wanted to bring up something else first. There's people that are else first. There's people that are else first. There's people that are saying pearls solve all known problems. saying pearls solve all known problems. saying pearls solve all known problems. Okay. And there's people that say that Okay. And there's people that say that Okay. And there's people that say that Tom Aldridge is one to pick Tom Aldridge is one to pick Tom Aldridge is one to pick one but they don't support version one but they don't support version one but they don't support version ranges. ranges. ranges. So, you know, they don't solve all those So, you know, they don't solve all those So, you know, they don't solve all those problems. They don't solve problems of problems. They don't solve problems of problems. They don't solve problems of products that use that don't use products that use that don't use products that use that don't use packages. Uh, and that's a lot of packages. Uh, and that's a lot of packages. Uh, and that's a lot of products. So, what we're we're talking products. So, what we're we're talking products. So, what we're we're talking about here is a problem about here is a problem about here is a problem where there's a vulnerability that where where there's a vulnerability that where where there's a vulnerability that where do you get the fix and that's in the do you get the fix and that's in the do you get the fix and that's in the product, but what is vulnerable is a product, but what is vulnerable is a product, but what is vulnerable is a component. Okay? and and you need to component. Okay? and and you need to component. Okay? and and you need to support f both if if the instructions support f both if if the instructions support f both if if the instructions were let's use CPE for the product and were let's use CPE for the product and were let's use CPE for the product and Pearl for the component and it was clear Pearl for the component and it was clear Pearl for the component and it was clear that that's what you were doing that that that's what you were doing that that that's what you were doing that would help would help would help everybody because of you know of a everybody because of you know of a everybody because of you know of a couple of reasons and one thing you'll couple of reasons and one thing you'll couple of reasons and one thing you'll notice in the C I don't know if you notice in the C I don't know if you notice in the C I don't know if you looked in the CVE entries you'll figure looked in the CVE entries you'll figure looked in the CVE entries you'll figure out that that if you look at the vendor out that that if you look at the vendor out that that if you look at the vendor and product fields in in the C in the CV and product fields in in the C in the CV and product fields in in the C in the CV or entries, they're often different than or entries, they're often different than or entries, they're often different than if the if a CPE is provided, the vendor if the if a CPE is provided, the vendor if the if a CPE is provided, the vendor and product in the CPE and nobody knows and product in the CPE and nobody knows and product in the CPE and nobody knows what that means. Is it just different what that means. Is it just different what that means. Is it just different parts of the company use different parts of the company use different parts of the company use different names? There's names? There's names? There's no there's no rigor anywhere. What no there's no rigor anywhere. What no there's no rigor anywhere. What what's going on? If if the answer is what's going on? If if the answer is what's going on? If if the answer is we're talking about the component that's we're talking about the component that's we're talking about the component that's vulnerable and not the product and the vulnerable and not the product and the vulnerable and not the product and the way I think about it is what's the way I think about it is what's the way I think about it is what's the product that's patched versus what's the product that's patched versus what's the product that's patched versus what's the product that has the product that has the product that has the vulnerability. Now maybe that's the vulnerability. Now maybe that's the vulnerability. Now maybe that's the wrong way but that's the way I've been wrong way but that's the way I've been wrong way but that's the way I've been thinking about it. I'm happy to comply thinking about it. I'm happy to comply thinking about it. I'm happy to comply with whatever that cons you know I want with whatever that cons you know I want with whatever that cons you know I want to be standardized that helps everybody to be standardized that helps everybody to be standardized that helps everybody but but that's what I see the but but that's what I see the but but that's what I see the difference. So I don't know what is that difference. So I don't know what is that difference. So I don't know what is that what you guys are doing with CPE versus what you guys are doing with CPE versus what you guys are doing with CPE versus CV uh versus uh pearls or do you know or CV uh versus uh pearls or do you know or CV uh versus uh pearls or do you know or is it anarchy? Oh I was just about to is it anarchy? Oh I was just about to is it anarchy? Oh I was just about to tell you the infamous it depends. tell you the infamous it depends. tell you the infamous it depends. Ah okay so if we had a problem in a Ah okay so if we had a problem in a Ah okay so if we had a problem in a package component of package component of package component of re okay then the question is is it in re okay then the question is is it in re okay then the question is is it in the container that's open the container that's open the container that's open shift or is it in the package underneath shift or is it in the package underneath shift or is it in the package underneath that container of open shift that container of open shift that container of open shift because scanning vendors will look at as because scanning vendors will look at as because scanning vendors will look at as being the same. It's not. Uh, and it being the same. It's not. Uh, and it being the same. It's not. Uh, and it really depends on the version level of really depends on the version level of really depends on the version level of those two. Ouch. Oh, that hurt. I'm good. All I do is put in my hurt. I'm good. All I do is put in my hurt. I'm good. All I do is put in my pocket now. Hold it. I'm not trusting pocket now. Hold it. I'm not trusting pocket now. Hold it. I'm not trusting that belt loop that belt loop that belt loop anymore. Um, of how we package that and anymore. Um, of how we package that and anymore. Um, of how we package that and and how they're using it. So it it and how they're using it. So it it and how they're using it. So it it depends on both ways because notice once depends on both ways because notice once depends on both ways because notice once it's in the container, it's listed it's in the container, it's listed it's in the container, it's listed differently. It's listed then as a differently. It's listed then as a differently. It's listed then as a component where if it's real, it's component where if it's real, it's component where if it's real, it's listed as a as a application. So you get listed as a as a application. So you get listed as a as a application. So you get Pearl in one and CPA in the other and Pearl in one and CPA in the other and Pearl in one and CPA in the other and they're totally seen differently by they're totally seen differently by they're totally seen differently by scanning vendor. And that's part of the scanning vendor. And that's part of the scanning vendor. And that's part of the problem and I think you kind of problem and I think you kind of problem and I think you kind of identified it is what do we mean and in identified it is what do we mean and in identified it is what do we mean and in some ways what you're talking Bruce it some ways what you're talking Bruce it some ways what you're talking Bruce it kind of made me think of do I need kind of made me think of do I need kind of made me think of do I need publish a publish a publish a key a generic key of how to read key a generic key of how to read key a generic key of how to read that I I didn't think of it that I I didn't think of it that I I didn't think of it before before before ahead you need I might give a I just wanted to highlight how big of a I just wanted to highlight how big of a I just wanted to highlight how big of a problem I think that is. problem I think that is. problem I think that is. Um, you know, it's one thing if you're Um, you know, it's one thing if you're Um, you know, it's one thing if you're the vendor, you you know what your stuff the vendor, you you know what your stuff the vendor, you you know what your stuff is, but if but if you have to like is, but if but if you have to like is, but if but if you have to like enrich, let's say you have to enrich the enrich, let's say you have to enrich the enrich, let's say you have to enrich the record for some reason and you have to record for some reason and you have to record for some reason and you have to figure out what the product is and you figure out what the product is and you figure out what the product is and you go to the vendor's website and they go to the vendor's website and they go to the vendor's website and they don't say the same thing. You can only don't say the same thing. You can only don't say the same thing. You can only use public references, then it's tricky use public references, then it's tricky use public references, then it's tricky and you end up it's hard to maintain a and you end up it's hard to maintain a and you end up it's hard to maintain a database that way. So that's that's a database that way. So that's that's a database that way. So that's that's a real problem. So if the vendors could real problem. So if the vendors could real problem. So if the vendors could say what their products are, right, that say what their products are, right, that say what their products are, right, that would be helpful. It's it's difficult. I would be helpful. It's it's difficult. I would be helpful. It's it's difficult. I know, but it it slows things down a lot. know, but it it slows things down a lot. know, but it it slows things down a lot. No, you just have to guess. Yeah, you're No, you just have to guess. Yeah, you're No, you just have to guess. Yeah, you're you're making me think a little bit you're making me think a little bit you're making me think a little bit differently in this conversation because differently in this conversation because differently in this conversation because now it goes back to what the EOX now it goes back to what the EOX now it goes back to what the EOX is. And this mic is not going to work is. And this mic is not going to work is. And this mic is not going to work very well with me. I can tell. very well with me. I can tell. very well with me. I can tell. Um, Um, Um, you know, if you look at my CVE you know, if you look at my CVE you know, if you look at my CVE pages, you're going to get one pages, you're going to get one pages, you're going to get one story. You're going to get initially story. You're going to get initially story. You're going to get initially because we we publish usually within because we we publish usually within because we we publish usually within like 3 days of the of an issue. Um, and like 3 days of the of an issue. Um, and like 3 days of the of an issue. Um, and it's usually faster than that, but three it's usually faster than that, but three it's usually faster than that, but three days is my max. I'm going to tell you days is my max. I'm going to tell you days is my max. I'm going to tell you Open Shift Open Shift Open Shift 4.x. And it's not until I publish in aa 4.x. And it's not until I publish in aa 4.x. And it's not until I publish in aa are you going to see the update of 412, are you going to see the update of 412, are you going to see the update of 412, 414, 416, 414, 416, 414, 416, right? Um, but that still doesn't give right? Um, but that still doesn't give right? Um, but that still doesn't give you the level of detail that you're you the level of detail that you're you the level of detail that you're really looking for, which is where the really looking for, which is where the really looking for, which is where the VEX file is. VEX file is. VEX file is. However, when I published the ARA, the However, when I published the ARA, the However, when I published the ARA, the ARA is accompanied by the Red Hat ARA is accompanied by the Red Hat ARA is accompanied by the Red Hat Security Advisory, which enumerates all Security Advisory, which enumerates all Security Advisory, which enumerates all the CVEEs in there, which means you have the CVEEs in there, which means you have the CVEEs in there, which means you have multiple different CVES in that same multiple different CVES in that same multiple different CVES in that same ARA. And now they each have different ARA. And now they each have different ARA. And now they each have different scoring levels, which again go back to scoring levels, which again go back to scoring levels, which again go back to if it's an open shift, I have a Red Hat if it's an open shift, I have a Red Hat if it's an open shift, I have a Red Hat uh excuse me, a re a different problem uh excuse me, a re a different problem uh excuse me, a re a different problem set yet again on what that scoring level set yet again on what that scoring level set yet again on what that scoring level is. So, it really goes to how it's used is. So, it really goes to how it's used is. So, it really goes to how it's used in the product, which goes back to that in the product, which goes back to that in the product, which goes back to that temporal temporal temporal problem. What I'm trying to do is map my problem. What I'm trying to do is map my problem. What I'm trying to do is map my mind through how I answer that mind through how I answer that mind through how I answer that information that Ed just asked me about, information that Ed just asked me about, information that Ed just asked me about, which I have security vendors, some I which I have security vendors, some I which I have security vendors, some I guess we're not here right now. Some guess we're not here right now. Some guess we're not here right now. Some pull from the CVE pull from the CVE pull from the CVE pages, some pull from the pages, some pull from the pages, some pull from the RHSAs, some pull from MBD, most of them. RHSAs, some pull from MBD, most of them. RHSAs, some pull from MBD, most of them. Some pull from CVE, a few of them. And Some pull from CVE, a few of them. And Some pull from CVE, a few of them. And then there's some who actually read my then there's some who actually read my then there's some who actually read my VEX VEX VEX files. I never walked my way through files. I never walked my way through files. I never walked my way through that until just now. And then think of that until just now. And then think of that until just now. And then think of if you're happen to be the MPD, which if you're happen to be the MPD, which if you're happen to be the MPD, which one are you supposed to pick, right? And one are you supposed to pick, right? And one are you supposed to pick, right? And what you know according to again what you know according to again what you know according to again according to NVD they say that they pull according to NVD they say that they pull according to NVD they say that they pull from CVD.org is they're upstream. from CVD.org is they're upstream. from CVD.org is they're upstream. That's what Tanya said three times last That's what Tanya said three times last That's what Tanya said three times last year. But sometimes the CVE will say year. But sometimes the CVE will say year. But sometimes the CVE will say something in product affected something something in product affected something something in product affected something different. It's again it's just hard to different. It's again it's just hard to different. It's again it's just hard to come up with the name and then if it come up with the name and then if it come up with the name and then if it doesn't say you go to the vendor's doesn't say you go to the vendor's doesn't say you go to the vendor's website and they give a list of products website and they give a list of products website and they give a list of products but their marketing material is but their marketing material is but their marketing material is different than their other material and different than their other material and different than their other material and you need a public reference and which you need a public reference and which you need a public reference and which one do you use? Right? It's just a one do you use? Right? It's just a one do you use? Right? It's just a that's just it's tricky, right? that's just it's tricky, right? that's just it's tricky, right? Is it George any? Well, no, just like Is it George any? Well, no, just like Is it George any? Well, no, just like all CVES, right? Like what are all the all CVES, right? Like what are all the all CVES, right? Like what are all the products, products, products, right? You know, so actually like you right? You know, so actually like you right? You know, so actually like you know, Red Hat's pretty I have a lot to know, Red Hat's pretty I have a lot to know, Red Hat's pretty I have a lot to pick from, right? So a lot of them I pick from, right? So a lot of them I pick from, right? So a lot of them I don't, don't, don't, right? I don't know what to I'm an easy right? I don't know what to I'm an easy right? I don't know what to I'm an easy target to talk to because it's out target to talk to because it's out target to talk to because it's out there. Um and and that's fair because there. Um and and that's fair because there. Um and and that's fair because that's why we we we believe in open and that's why we we we believe in open and that's why we we we believe in open and transparent. But that's why I was asking transparent. But that's why I was asking transparent. But that's why I was asking before about like are you know are you before about like are you know are you before about like are you know are you selling it? Are you the vendor? then you selling it? Are you the vendor? then you selling it? Are you the vendor? then you can say this is definitively the names I can say this is definitively the names I can say this is definitively the names I use for the things right if I go into use for the things right if I go into use for the things right if I go into help about that's the name that's going help about that's the name that's going help about that's the name that's going to be there so like it's all public and to be there so like it's all public and to be there so like it's all public and we know what it is so it can be we know what it is so it can be we know what it is so it can be consistent because if it's not public consistent because if it's not public consistent because if it's not public then how do you how do you pick what the then how do you how do you pick what the then how do you how do you pick what the name of the thing is you think it would name of the thing is you think it would name of the thing is you think it would be easy it is not easy there's many many be easy it is not easy there's many many be easy it is not easy there's many many examples where I do not know what the examples where I do not know what the examples where I do not know what the name of it is and sometimes people name of it is and sometimes people name of it is and sometimes people change the names which of course they're change the names which of course they're change the names which of course they're allowed to right but then do you go back allowed to right but then do you go back allowed to right but then do you go back and change everything and and change everything and and change everything and No, are hard. I I had that problem No, are hard. I I had that problem No, are hard. I I had that problem internally, you know. I mean, just Red internally, you know. I mean, just Red internally, you know. I mean, just Red Hat is what Red Hat Inc., you Hat is what Red Hat Inc., you Hat is what Red Hat Inc., you know. Of course, we name all our know. Of course, we name all our know. Of course, we name all our products RH something for some odd products RH something for some odd products RH something for some odd reason. I haven't figured out. reason. I haven't figured out. reason. I haven't figured out. So I'll just say that um for this So I'll just say that um for this So I'll just say that um for this specific problem like pulling from specific problem like pulling from specific problem like pulling from library science this problem is the the library science this problem is the the library science this problem is the the problem of controlled ontologies which problem of controlled ontologies which problem of controlled ontologies which CPE is a controlled ontology and there CPE is a controlled ontology and there CPE is a controlled ontology and there is a pretty substantial library science is a pretty substantial library science is a pretty substantial library science literature of how do you deal with literature of how do you deal with literature of how do you deal with trying to resolve what the canonical trying to resolve what the canonical trying to resolve what the canonical name is for something and in this name is for something and in this name is for something and in this particular system like I think the idea particular system like I think the idea particular system like I think the idea would be that the CPE dictionary is would be that the CPE dictionary is would be that the CPE dictionary is supposed to be the authoritative source supposed to be the authoritative source supposed to be the authoritative source of what the official name is for of what the official name is for of what the official name is for something and the point of conflict both something and the point of conflict both something and the point of conflict both is when you is when you is when you introducing new names and sort of who introducing new names and sort of who introducing new names and sort of who has the authority to issue directives to has the authority to issue directives to has the authority to issue directives to CPE to say like hey can you add this CPE to say like hey can you add this CPE to say like hey can you add this thing to the dictionary and also dealing thing to the dictionary and also dealing thing to the dictionary and also dealing with things like renames like product with things like renames like product with things like renames like product renames how do you deal with resolving renames how do you deal with resolving renames how do you deal with resolving the new name or you know having the new name or you know having the new name or you know having interlining between the two but I think interlining between the two but I think interlining between the two but I think the idea is that CPE is supposed to be the idea is that CPE is supposed to be the idea is that CPE is supposed to be the that the dictionary is supposed to the that the dictionary is supposed to the that the dictionary is supposed to be the authorative answer let's talk to be the authorative answer let's talk to be the authorative answer let's talk to where that's a problem that the CPE where that's a problem that the CPE where that's a problem that the CPE dictionary is not a dictionary it's just dictionary is not a dictionary it's just dictionary is not a dictionary it's just a list of all the CPEs ever issued a list of all the CPEs ever issued a list of all the CPEs ever issued There's no mapping between the CPE There's no mapping between the CPE There's no mapping between the CPE dictionary and a dictionary and a dictionary and a product, right? There isn't or a vendor. product, right? There isn't or a vendor. product, right? There isn't or a vendor. There's no mapping anywhere. You can't There's no mapping anywhere. You can't There's no mapping anywhere. You can't look at the CPE dictionary and find out look at the CPE dictionary and find out look at the CPE dictionary and find out that it's that it's that it's IBM. You just have to guess it because IBM. You just have to guess it because IBM. You just have to guess it because it says IBM or International Business it says IBM or International Business it says IBM or International Business Machine or International Business Machine or International Business Machine or International Business Machine Inc. or something like that. The Machine Inc. or something like that. The Machine Inc. or something like that. The other thing is vendors were not allowed other thing is vendors were not allowed other thing is vendors were not allowed to make to make to make CPEs, right? Only MBD could make CPEs, right? Only MBD could make CPEs, right? Only MBD could make them. The reason that vendors, and I'm them. The reason that vendors, and I'm them. The reason that vendors, and I'm just speaking for us, but I which is just speaking for us, but I which is just speaking for us, but I which is Oracle, um, but it seems to be true of Oracle, um, but it seems to be true of Oracle, um, but it seems to be true of everybody, we weren't issuing CPEs is everybody, we weren't issuing CPEs is everybody, we weren't issuing CPEs is because NVD wouldn't allow it. Okay. Now, you would think that the it. Okay. Now, you would think that the it. Okay. Now, you would think that the vendor would know more about what the vendor would know more about what the vendor would know more about what the products are than somebody else, like products are than somebody else, like products are than somebody else, like what the product names are, but that's what the product names are, but that's what the product names are, but that's not the way CPEs not the way CPEs not the way CPEs work. And the reason I said worked is work. And the reason I said worked is work. And the reason I said worked is because they're not getting assigned because they're not getting assigned because they're not getting assigned much anymore, right? In in the last um much anymore, right? In in the last um much anymore, right? In in the last um in in in NVD, so I think this year the biggest NVD, so I think this year the biggest NVD, so I think this year the biggest the biggest month has been onethird of the biggest month has been onethird of the biggest month has been onethird of the uh CVS got at least one CPE. the uh CVS got at least one CPE. the uh CVS got at least one CPE. you know, that's the biggest percentage you know, that's the biggest percentage you know, that's the biggest percentage this this year. And uh you know, this this year. And uh you know, this this year. And uh you know, basically since February of last year, basically since February of last year, basically since February of last year, they've not gotten above like 70%. they've not gotten above like 70%. they've not gotten above like 70%. Usually, it was around 40 or less Usually, it was around 40 or less Usually, it was around 40 or less uh of the CVE has got at least one CPE uh of the CVE has got at least one CPE uh of the CVE has got at least one CPE assigned to it. Now, they're putting out assigned to it. Now, they're putting out assigned to it. Now, they're putting out statistics and things like that in their statistics and things like that in their statistics and things like that in their dashboard that are misleading that say dashboard that are misleading that say dashboard that are misleading that say they're they're enriching, you know, they're they're enriching, you know, they're they're enriching, you know, like 80% of them. But if you care about like 80% of them. But if you care about like 80% of them. But if you care about the CPE part, we're down to one/ird or the CPE part, we're down to one/ird or the CPE part, we're down to one/ird or less and mostly less. So you can't less and mostly less. So you can't less and mostly less. So you can't depend on them for that. And we'd like depend on them for that. And we'd like depend on them for that. And we'd like to go someplace where we can depend on to go someplace where we can depend on to go someplace where we can depend on them. Hopefully CB C the CVE or will do them. Hopefully CB C the CVE or will do them. Hopefully CB C the CVE or will do that for us and we're looking to that or that for us and we're looking to that or that for us and we're looking to that or or somebody else. But that dictionary is or somebody else. But that dictionary is or somebody else. But that dictionary is completely misnamed. the CPE completely misnamed. the CPE completely misnamed. the CPE dictionary that furthermore well when dictionary that furthermore well when dictionary that furthermore well when things change names there's an things change names there's an things change names there's an indication that that happened that this indication that that happened that this indication that that happened that this CP is the same product as that CP even CP is the same product as that CP even CP is the same product as that CP even though they've got different IDs in the though they've got different IDs in the though they've got different IDs in the vendor and product vendor and product vendor and product area. So you know there's there's none area. So you know there's there's none area. So you know there's there's none of that going on there. You can't that's of that going on there. You can't that's of that going on there. You can't that's not something you can use. Does anyone disagree? Yeah, I would say I would tell disagree? Yeah, I would say I would tell disagree? Yeah, I would say I would tell you that we we have a we have a legal you that we we have a we have a legal you that we we have a we have a legal dictionary for for licenses and you're dictionary for for licenses and you're dictionary for for licenses and you're supposed to whenever you're going to use supposed to whenever you're going to use supposed to whenever you're going to use a new component, you have to put the a new component, you have to put the a new component, you have to put the name of the component, the name of of name of the component, the name of of name of the component, the name of of the Oracle product. And I can tell you the Oracle product. And I can tell you the Oracle product. And I can tell you it's a hell of a lot harder for me to it's a hell of a lot harder for me to it's a hell of a lot harder for me to figure out the Oracle product than it is figure out the Oracle product than it is figure out the Oracle product than it is the the third party product because the the third party product because the the third party product because there's, you know, it's just anarchy. there's, you know, it's just anarchy. there's, you know, it's just anarchy. We're we're working on fixing that. But We're we're working on fixing that. But We're we're working on fixing that. But and I completely understand his issue and I completely understand his issue and I completely understand his issue where he can't figure out what the where he can't figure out what the where he can't figure out what the product name is because I can't either product name is because I can't either product name is because I can't either and I know that, you know, and I work and I know that, you know, and I work and I know that, you know, and I work there. there. there. Yeah. I just see if we if you if you Yeah. I just see if we if you if you Yeah. I just see if we if you if you move the problem, you just have the same move the problem, you just have the same move the problem, you just have the same problem in CVE land unless you unless problem in CVE land unless you unless problem in CVE land unless you unless you do something about the authoritative you do something about the authoritative you do something about the authoritative part of like who has the name and then part of like who has the name and then part of like who has the name and then do we go back and change old do we go back and change old do we go back and change old records, right? I mean like th those records, right? I mean like th those records, right? I mean like th those issues are I think the things that have issues are I think the things that have issues are I think the things that have slowed down the NBD and so if come up slowed down the NBD and so if come up slowed down the NBD and so if come up with a new system and you don't address with a new system and you don't address with a new system and you don't address those then it's just the same thing all those then it's just the same thing all those then it's just the same thing all over again right I'm going to go with you about the right I'm going to go with you about the right I'm going to go with you about the authoritative record uh in fact it's authoritative record uh in fact it's authoritative record uh in fact it's probably for the scratch pad we have to probably for the scratch pad we have to probably for the scratch pad we have to be more definitive about the be more definitive about the be more definitive about the authoritative record authoritative record authoritative record I That's the other thing there wasn't a bunch of CNAs right thing there wasn't a bunch of CNAs right thing there wasn't a bunch of CNAs right so correct a bunch of this problem is so correct a bunch of this problem is so correct a bunch of this problem is because in the beginning it was because in the beginning it was because in the beginning it was different and then we expanded it but it different and then we expanded it but it different and then we expanded it but it was voluntary and then everyone wasn't was voluntary and then everyone wasn't was voluntary and then everyone wasn't doing all the stuff so still like how doing all the stuff so still like how doing all the stuff so still like how who do you rely on for what thing if who do you rely on for what thing if who do you rely on for what thing if there aren't mandatory fields. So what there aren't mandatory fields. So what there aren't mandatory fields. So what that points to it and something we that points to it and something we that points to it and something we talked on uh the extended in the lunch talked on uh the extended in the lunch talked on uh the extended in the lunch conversation was um the maturation conversation was um the maturation conversation was um the maturation of well of of well of of well of processes at different rates within the processes at different rates within the processes at different rates within the entire ecosystem and not being entire ecosystem and not being entire ecosystem and not being collaborative in our collaborative in our collaborative in our objectives. Okay, trying to be careful objectives. Okay, trying to be careful objectives. Okay, trying to be careful how I pick those words. Um, it's not how I pick those words. Um, it's not how I pick those words. Um, it's not that we didn't sometimes communicate that we didn't sometimes communicate that we didn't sometimes communicate because we were across groups, but it because we were across groups, but it because we were across groups, but it didn't mean that the groups were talking didn't mean that the groups were talking didn't mean that the groups were talking to each other and had any any tie off. to each other and had any any tie off. to each other and had any any tie off. So, when you get to that that problem So, when you get to that that problem So, when you get to that that problem about naming, it becomes a real problem. about naming, it becomes a real problem. about naming, it becomes a real problem. And I I'll I'll pick on as an example. And I I'll I'll pick on as an example. And I I'll I'll pick on as an example. If you just If you just If you just said, okay, what said, okay, what said, okay, what version? And and you know, you could say version? And and you know, you could say version? And and you know, you could say I'll just say rail 8. Okay. What is I'll just say rail 8. Okay. What is I'll just say rail 8. Okay. What is actually an act of support? Well, it's actually an act of support? Well, it's actually an act of support? Well, it's above 88 and above. Okay? So, you you above 88 and above. Okay? So, you you above 88 and above. Okay? So, you you can't say rail 8 for can't say rail 8 for can't say rail 8 for CPE because there's a difference between CPE because there's a difference between CPE because there's a difference between 88 and 86 of pretty significant 88 and 86 of pretty significant 88 and 86 of pretty significant proportion. Not as bad as going to real proportion. Not as bad as going to real proportion. Not as bad as going to real 9, which of course is totally different. 9, which of course is totally different. 9, which of course is totally different. Yes. Uh I hate to bring up alias service Yes. Uh I hate to bring up alias service Yes. Uh I hate to bring up alias service again because I really hate it. Jonathan again because I really hate it. Jonathan again because I really hate it. Jonathan can attest to that. He hates it even can attest to that. He hates it even can attest to that. He hates it even more than I do. But any solution has got more than I do. But any solution has got more than I do. But any solution has got to have some an actual you know to have some an actual you know to have some an actual you know crossorrelation cross mapping between crossorrelation cross mapping between crossorrelation cross mapping between old names new names names in different old names new names names in different old names new names names in different package managers names from different package managers names from different package managers names from different scan engines. Um like for example we scan engines. Um like for example we scan engines. Um like for example we have supplier and distro aliasing re has have supplier and distro aliasing re has have supplier and distro aliasing re has like 10 different names associated with like 10 different names associated with like 10 different names associated with it's all gets aliased to re I'm just it's all gets aliased to re I'm just it's all gets aliased to re I'm just saying like you got to have that mapping saying like you got to have that mapping saying like you got to have that mapping and any new system that we create is and any new system that we create is and any new system that we create is going to have to have a mapping to older going to have to have a mapping to older going to have to have a mapping to older CPEs if they change names. And I have a CPEs if they change names. And I have a CPEs if they change names. And I have a yet another point to make that's even yet another point to make that's even yet another point to make that's even more related to that because it's um I more related to that because it's um I more related to that because it's um I don't want to give away the Can you hold don't want to give away the Can you hold don't want to give away the Can you hold that one for a second because my brain that one for a second because my brain that one for a second because my brain won't hold what I already has. I'm I'm won't hold what I already has. I'm I'm won't hold what I already has. I'm I'm running ADA processor so right buffer's running ADA processor so right buffer's running ADA processor so right buffer's already crashed. I I already crashed. I I already crashed. I I think there's a key there's a mapping think there's a key there's a mapping think there's a key there's a mapping and I already forgot the third one. Okay, go is discord. Okay, go is discord. Okay, go is discord. The discord question from Andrew Sudter. The discord question from Andrew Sudter. The discord question from Andrew Sudter. He says, I think uh this is where He says, I think uh this is where He says, I think uh this is where delegating the CP dictionary out in a delegating the CP dictionary out in a delegating the CP dictionary out in a CNA like manner would help. Vendors can CNA like manner would help. Vendors can CNA like manner would help. Vendors can then make updates themselves within a then make updates themselves within a then make updates themselves within a defined scope. But there's still the defined scope. But there's still the defined scope. But there's still the question of what value it really brings. question of what value it really brings. question of what value it really brings. Uh the CPA dictionary uh is it worth Uh the CPA dictionary uh is it worth Uh the CPA dictionary uh is it worth having? Wow, that's a that's a big debatable Wow, that's a that's a big debatable Wow, that's a that's a big debatable point. Let's say that we need a point. Let's say that we need a point. Let's say that we need a dictionary that we can all go to and dictionary that we can all go to and dictionary that we can all go to and refer from. It's like the the one point refer from. It's like the the one point refer from. It's like the the one point you go to for a piece of that kind of you go to for a piece of that kind of you go to for a piece of that kind of data. data. data. Now, I'm going to presuppose that Now, I'm going to presuppose that Now, I'm going to presuppose that whoever is the authoritative source whoever is the authoritative source whoever is the authoritative source needs to be able to feed that in a needs to be able to feed that in a needs to be able to feed that in a common common common way. If we do that, then CPE is way. If we do that, then CPE is way. If we do that, then CPE is required. required. required. But to go with that, you actually need But to go with that, you actually need But to go with that, you actually need something like EOX because you have to something like EOX because you have to something like EOX because you have to know the life cycle of the problem set. know the life cycle of the problem set. know the life cycle of the problem set. So the name knows when it's no longer So the name knows when it's no longer So the name knows when it's no longer supported, which goes to an end of life supported, which goes to an end of life supported, which goes to an end of life problem set that we're experiencing like problem set that we're experiencing like problem set that we're experiencing like with with with no.js. Okay, that's a CVE challenge, but no.js. Okay, that's a CVE challenge, but no.js. Okay, that's a CVE challenge, but it's really an ecosystem problem. it's really an ecosystem problem. it's really an ecosystem problem. So we have to be able So we have to be able So we have to be able to collaborate those to work together so to collaborate those to work together so to collaborate those to work together so that we are answering the question in that we are answering the question in that we are answering the question in full instead of in full instead of in full instead of in part. That's Pete's opinion of of that. part. That's Pete's opinion of of that. part. That's Pete's opinion of of that. Ed, you want to add to that? Ed, you want to add to that? Ed, you want to add to that? I can pick one I can pick one I can pick one thing. It's really like three parts. The thing. It's really like three parts. The thing. It's really like three parts. The first part is there's a CNA registry and first part is there's a CNA registry and first part is there's a CNA registry and CNAs can put references there, right? CNAs can put references there, right? CNAs can put references there, right? Like this is this is our security Like this is this is our security Like this is this is our security contact. whatever, right? contact. whatever, right? contact. whatever, right? Um, and then they could post this is Um, and then they could post this is Um, and then they could post this is what we call all of our stuff. Like this what we call all of our stuff. Like this what we call all of our stuff. Like this is the authoritative list of all of our is the authoritative list of all of our is the authoritative list of all of our stuff. So if somebody doesn't use that stuff. So if somebody doesn't use that stuff. So if somebody doesn't use that list and they're not doing they're then list and they're not doing they're then list and they're not doing they're then you can just look and be like, "Hey, the you can just look and be like, "Hey, the you can just look and be like, "Hey, the vendor said it's called this and you're vendor said it's called this and you're vendor said it's called this and you're not calling it not calling it not calling it that, right?" But it has to be somewhere that, right?" But it has to be somewhere that, right?" But it has to be somewhere that like you know our marketing that like you know our marketing that like you know our marketing material says this over here says this material says this over here says this material says this over here says this over here says this but this is the one over here says this but this is the one over here says this but this is the one we mean for CVEes like this is what we mean for CVEes like this is what we mean for CVEes like this is what we're calling it right that if I could we're calling it right that if I could we're calling it right that if I could just you know make everybody do just you know make everybody do just you know make everybody do something you just name yeah because something you just name yeah because something you just name yeah because what you just said is every upstream what you just said is every upstream what you just said is every upstream package has to have some kind of name so package has to have some kind of name so package has to have some kind of name so that when that when that when some organization like mine pulls it some organization like mine pulls it some organization like mine pulls it down and we put it in our sbomb we call down and we put it in our sbomb we call down and we put it in our sbomb we call it the same thing so that when we do our it the same thing so that when we do our it the same thing so that when we do our AR we actually use that AR we actually use that AR we actually use that name right I think name right I think name right I think it's is it MZ that that's brought up it's is it MZ that that's brought up it's is it MZ that that's brought up having some kind of DNS like lookup for having some kind of DNS like lookup for having some kind of DNS like lookup for that exact thing it I like we need a that exact thing it I like we need a that exact thing it I like we need a lookup I'll leave the DNS out because lookup I'll leave the DNS out because lookup I'll leave the DNS out because that that will that just triggers that that will that just triggers that that will that just triggers geographic wars that we don't need geographic wars that we don't need geographic wars that we don't need um well one was I was going to agree a um well one was I was going to agree a um well one was I was going to agree a little bit with the like a name service little bit with the like a name service little bit with the like a name service like lookup. Um but uh so we have an like lookup. Um but uh so we have an like lookup. Um but uh so we have an open source project called guac open source project called guac open source project called guac underneath the open ssf um does a lot of underneath the open ssf um does a lot of underneath the open ssf um does a lot of stuff in this space. I think one of the stuff in this space. I think one of the stuff in this space. I think one of the biggest challenges we have and also biggest challenges we have and also biggest challenges we have and also security vendor is security vendor is security vendor is around understanding how do I look up around understanding how do I look up around understanding how do I look up that name? How do I like if like when we that name? How do I like if like when we that name? How do I like if like when we get CPEs or we get pearls in particular get CPEs or we get pearls in particular get CPEs or we get pearls in particular one of the biggest challenges is it's one of the biggest challenges is it's one of the biggest challenges is it's potentially a many to many mapping. Um potentially a many to many mapping. Um potentially a many to many mapping. Um especially if we kind of look even especially if we kind of look even especially if we kind of look even outside of vendors and we start to look outside of vendors and we start to look outside of vendors and we start to look at the open source uh stuff, we end up at the open source uh stuff, we end up at the open source uh stuff, we end up seeing that seeing that seeing that uh one pearl is ambiguous or it could be uh one pearl is ambiguous or it could be uh one pearl is ambiguous or it could be ambiguous. Um sometimes you get enough ambiguous. Um sometimes you get enough ambiguous. Um sometimes you get enough information in the pearl to know that it information in the pearl to know that it information in the pearl to know that it specifically points to that, but then specifically points to that, but then specifically points to that, but then you could still have multiple pearls you could still have multiple pearls you could still have multiple pearls that point to one sort of piece of that point to one sort of piece of that point to one sort of piece of software package component, whatever you software package component, whatever you software package component, whatever you want to call it. And then vice versa if want to call it. And then vice versa if want to call it. And then vice versa if you're kind of if I am given I have some you're kind of if I am given I have some you're kind of if I am given I have some piece of software piece of software piece of software here. What does that map back to? Um can here. What does that map back to? Um can here. What does that map back to? Um can also be quite ambiguous. also be quite ambiguous. also be quite ambiguous. um and without having some canonical way um and without having some canonical way um and without having some canonical way of of of uh going back to whether it's a uh going back to whether it's a uh going back to whether it's a dictionary or whether it's essentially dictionary or whether it's essentially dictionary or whether it's essentially like a DNS lookup or something like like a DNS lookup or something like like a DNS lookup or something like that. It could be very very complicated that. It could be very very complicated that. It could be very very complicated and then made even more so when somebody and then made even more so when somebody and then made even more so when somebody comes in and let's say renames something comes in and let's say renames something comes in and let's say renames something and sometimes it's not even necessarily and sometimes it's not even necessarily and sometimes it's not even necessarily renaming. It's just as simple as renaming. It's just as simple as renaming. It's just as simple as somebody capitalized a a G or something somebody capitalized a a G or something somebody capitalized a a G or something like that and then all of a sudden like that and then all of a sudden like that and then all of a sudden everything downstream breaks. everything downstream breaks. everything downstream breaks. We're experiencing that using Guac right We're experiencing that using Guac right We're experiencing that using Guac right now and and uh we have a new now and and uh we have a new now and and uh we have a new contribution coming that I think you're contribution coming that I think you're contribution coming that I think you're probably Yes. Yeah. So, not that that's probably Yes. Yeah. So, not that that's probably Yes. Yeah. So, not that that's going to solve everything. Yeah, I know. going to solve everything. Yeah, I know. going to solve everything. Yeah, I know. I hope this this is where you get into I hope this this is where you get into I hope this this is where you get into the hairy details. don't want to try to the hairy details. don't want to try to the hairy details. don't want to try to solution here, but it gives you an idea solution here, but it gives you an idea solution here, but it gives you an idea of the depth of the problem set because of the depth of the problem set because of the depth of the problem set because we never set guidelines up at the we never set guidelines up at the we never set guidelines up at the beginning and then we didn't deconlict beginning and then we didn't deconlict beginning and then we didn't deconlict our our our approaches. So, we're into the hairy bag approaches. So, we're into the hairy bag approaches. So, we're into the hairy bag of how do of how do of how do we back out to some point that we find we back out to some point that we find we back out to some point that we find acceptable by project, which is really acceptable by project, which is really acceptable by project, which is really the the that's a terrible way to do it the the that's a terrible way to do it the the that's a terrible way to do it because like everyone then quote has a because like everyone then quote has a because like everyone then quote has a vote. Um, and I don't think that works. vote. Um, and I don't think that works. vote. Um, and I don't think that works. I sorry, I've been on too many I sorry, I've been on too many I sorry, I've been on too many uh, goat uh, goat uh, goat ropes. Uh, so we've got to find a way to ropes. Uh, so we've got to find a way to ropes. Uh, so we've got to find a way to do that. Go ahead. do that. Go ahead. do that. Go ahead. Another question on Discord from Tom. Another question on Discord from Tom. Another question on Discord from Tom. Uh, he asks, "What if different people Uh, he asks, "What if different people Uh, he asks, "What if different people within the company use different names within the company use different names within the company use different names for the product? That happens all the for the product? That happens all the for the product? That happens all the time." time." time." So you have to have who is that source So you have to have who is that source So you have to have who is that source of truth? of truth? of truth? No, I I I am of the belief that it's the No, I I I am of the belief that it's the No, I I I am of the belief that it's the security team for security team for security team for product. And I say that product. And I say that product. And I say that because we are the ones that have to because we are the ones that have to because we are the ones that have to track the problem and assign that it track the problem and assign that it track the problem and assign that it needs to be done and communicate needs to be done and communicate needs to be done and communicate externally. And if you're going to tie externally. And if you're going to tie externally. And if you're going to tie your VEX statement to where your ESBOM your VEX statement to where your ESBOM your VEX statement to where your ESBOM is, then you need to be signing off on is, then you need to be signing off on is, then you need to be signing off on your ESBOM. That that is the release your ESBOM. That that is the release your ESBOM. That that is the release that you're supporting and you're doing that you're supporting and you're doing that you're supporting and you're doing your V management again. So you use the your V management again. So you use the your V management again. So you use the same terms. Now does that mean that term same terms. Now does that mean that term same terms. Now does that mean that term is consistent from product to is consistent from product to is consistent from product to product? Not necessarily, but it has to product? Not necessarily, but it has to product? Not necessarily, but it has to be consistent within the product. Also, they won't uh they won't Also, they won't uh they won't Also, they won't uh they won't capitalize weird things or put dashes or capitalize weird things or put dashes or capitalize weird things or put dashes or spaces in places like marketing one. spaces in places like marketing one. spaces in places like marketing one. That's another thing. That's a naming That's another thing. That's a naming That's another thing. That's a naming convention problem that that we're convention problem that that we're convention problem that that we're trying to work our way through. Uh trying to work our way through. Uh trying to work our way through. Uh because we're using guac and we're because we're using guac and we're because we're using guac and we're running into a bunch of problems running into a bunch of problems running into a bunch of problems internally for our how we manifest internally for our how we manifest internally for our how we manifest everything. And you'll hear me talk everything. And you'll hear me talk everything. And you'll hear me talk internally manifest. I call externally internally manifest. I call externally internally manifest. I call externally an SBOM because that's when you add an SBOM because that's when you add an SBOM because that's when you add licensing and a bunch of other stuff and licensing and a bunch of other stuff and licensing and a bunch of other stuff and I see that as a static file. Um, but my I see that as a static file. Um, but my I see that as a static file. Um, but my vex has got to be tied to that and we're vex has got to be tied to that and we're vex has got to be tied to that and we're trying to I don't know if we work with trying to I don't know if we work with trying to I don't know if we work with you guys on this cryptographically you guys on this cryptographically you guys on this cryptographically linking those. Okay. Um, you got to and linking those. Okay. Um, you got to and linking those. Okay. Um, you got to and that's why I say it's got to be the that's why I say it's got to be the that's why I say it's got to be the security team because more often than security team because more often than security team because more often than not people might hash it or they might not people might hash it or they might not people might hash it or they might sign it, but they don't necessarily link sign it, but they don't necessarily link sign it, but they don't necessarily link it in a way a security team will think it in a way a security team will think it in a way a security team will think of it. And that's what the the the phone of it. And that's what the the the phone of it. And that's what the the the phone scanner community looks for. That's what scanner community looks for. That's what scanner community looks for. That's what the customer looks for. Remember the old the customer looks for. Remember the old the customer looks for. Remember the old days when we used to PGB sign days when we used to PGB sign days when we used to PGB sign everything. Um, that's still the everything. Um, that's still the everything. Um, that's still the mentality. Bruce, you got something? mentality. Bruce, you got something? mentality. Bruce, you got something? Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, the a key problem is just getting the the a key problem is just getting the the a key problem is just getting the vendor vendor vendor name. If we could get the vendor name, name. If we could get the vendor name, name. If we could get the vendor name, that would help. At least I could ask that would help. At least I could ask that would help. At least I could ask the vendor what the name of their the vendor what the name of their the vendor what the name of their products products products was. The was. The was. The um, right now there's a name you could um, right now there's a name you could um, right now there's a name you could get from cve.org. get from cve.org. get from cve.org. or for everybody that ever assigned a or for everybody that ever assigned a or for everybody that ever assigned a CV, CV, CV, right? There's a short form or right? There's a short form or right? There's a short form or something. We could we could all decide something. We could we could all decide something. We could we could all decide we'll use the short form name that that we'll use the short form name that that we'll use the short form name that that CVE.org is CVE.org is CVE.org is using. If we could, but then you got a using. If we could, but then you got a using. If we could, but then you got a problem of the third parties when problem of the third parties when problem of the third parties when there's loads and loads of them that there's loads and loads of them that there's loads and loads of them that never uh entered a CBE, never uh entered a CBE, never uh entered a CBE, right? So, for that, you know, we ought right? So, for that, you know, we ought right? So, for that, you know, we ought to have to have to have where I work, where I live, you can get where I work, where I live, you can get where I work, where I live, you can get a driver's license to drive a car, but a driver's license to drive a car, but a driver's license to drive a car, but you can also get something that looks you can also get something that looks you can also get something that looks almost the same, but it's just an almost the same, but it's just an almost the same, but it's just an identity. So, if we could get some kind identity. So, if we could get some kind identity. So, if we could get some kind of thing for, you know, CNAs, where we of thing for, you know, CNAs, where we of thing for, you know, CNAs, where we have a CNA that that can drive cars and have a CNA that that can drive cars and have a CNA that that can drive cars and a CNA that's just an identity and that, a CNA that's just an identity and that, a CNA that's just an identity and that, you know, that that would be something, you know, that that would be something, you know, that that would be something, but I'm not trying to push it on to but I'm not trying to push it on to but I'm not trying to push it on to CV.org. I'm saying something like that. CV.org. I'm saying something like that. CV.org. I'm saying something like that. It's interesting because that It's interesting because that It's interesting because that that extra session I'll call it the that extra session I'll call it the that extra session I'll call it the inter session session uh we actually uh inter session session uh we actually uh inter session session uh we actually uh talked about are there tiers of talked about are there tiers of talked about are there tiers of CNAs? In other words, if you meant the CNAs? In other words, if you meant the CNAs? In other words, if you meant the minimal essential elements like in the minimal essential elements like in the minimal essential elements like in the uh MVBE that Art and Jay spoke to and uh MVBE that Art and Jay spoke to and uh MVBE that Art and Jay spoke to and you ascribed to a you ascribed to a you ascribed to a certain other characteristic, you would certain other characteristic, you would certain other characteristic, you would have that identity card. And there's a have that identity card. And there's a have that identity card. And there's a lot that would probably use it, but to lot that would probably use it, but to lot that would probably use it, but to get to like the driver's license, you'd get to like the driver's license, you'd get to like the driver's license, you'd have to enrich your have to enrich your have to enrich your record to be record to be record to be there and that would be a different there and that would be a different there and that would be a different tier. And then maybe there's something tier. And then maybe there's something tier. And then maybe there's something more where you have to do blah blah blah more where you have to do blah blah blah more where you have to do blah blah blah blah extra. Okay, notice I didn't name blah extra. Okay, notice I didn't name blah extra. Okay, notice I didn't name blah blah because I don't know what it blah blah because I don't know what it blah blah because I don't know what it is. um that we could say, "Okay, that's is. um that we could say, "Okay, that's is. um that we could say, "Okay, that's the the Cadillac of if you will, the BMW the the Cadillac of if you will, the BMW the the Cadillac of if you will, the BMW pick your car brand of of driving and uh pick your car brand of of driving and uh pick your car brand of of driving and uh or your chauffeur, maybe we call that." or your chauffeur, maybe we call that." or your chauffeur, maybe we call that." And then we've had a conversation And then we've had a conversation And then we've had a conversation uh Madison and I did about uh uh what uh Madison and I did about uh uh what uh Madison and I did about uh uh what does a CNAR then do because in many does a CNAR then do because in many does a CNAR then do because in many respects it's not the secretariat that respects it's not the secretariat that respects it's not the secretariat that should be doing it because that's should be doing it because that's should be doing it because that's operations but it is a CNAR duty to help operations but it is a CNAR duty to help operations but it is a CNAR duty to help direct and order that. And I think direct and order that. And I think direct and order that. And I think that's probably where we need to think that's probably where we need to think that's probably where we need to think differently in the CDE program to allow differently in the CDE program to allow differently in the CDE program to allow for that to work. Okay. Notice these are for that to work. Okay. Notice these are for that to work. Okay. Notice these are all possibility thoughts that we've all possibility thoughts that we've all possibility thoughts that we've probably talked about in the last month, probably talked about in the last month, probably talked about in the last month, two weeks, week. Uh Matt and I were just two weeks, week. Uh Matt and I were just two weeks, week. Uh Matt and I were just talking last week on this. So, uh it's talking last week on this. So, uh it's talking last week on this. So, uh it's pretty fresh in my mind. So, when they pretty fresh in my mind. So, when they pretty fresh in my mind. So, when they when people at the inter session said, when people at the inter session said, when people at the inter session said, "Hey, I like that idea about cheering. "Hey, I like that idea about cheering. "Hey, I like that idea about cheering. You know, I didn't think that would sell You know, I didn't think that would sell You know, I didn't think that would sell very well." But the concept that you very well." But the concept that you very well." But the concept that you just spoke to, I think actually does just spoke to, I think actually does just spoke to, I think actually does sell because now you give people the sell because now you give people the sell because now you give people the ability of I can perform that much. I ability of I can perform that much. I ability of I can perform that much. I can at least be an entry bar and I have can at least be an entry bar and I have can at least be an entry bar and I have a way to get my record there and I have a way to get my record there and I have a way to get my record there and I have a federated way to approach to get other a federated way to approach to get other a federated way to approach to get other things. What we didn't do is make it in things. What we didn't do is make it in things. What we didn't do is make it in my opinion easy to adopt my opinion easy to adopt my opinion easy to adopt and it's not clear and it's extremely so and it's not clear and it's extremely so and it's not clear and it's extremely so something on the board we talk real bad something on the board we talk real bad something on the board we talk real bad about. We had the MongoDB is it Carmen? about. We had the MongoDB is it Carmen? about. We had the MongoDB is it Carmen? Yeah. Um that said she wants to do the Yeah. Um that said she wants to do the Yeah. Um that said she wants to do the right thing but she just doesn't have right thing but she just doesn't have right thing but she just doesn't have enough guidance about what the right enough guidance about what the right enough guidance about what the right thing is. thing is. thing is. And and Alec will tell you you know I I And and Alec will tell you you know I I And and Alec will tell you you know I I saw he snuck in here. um is that you saw he snuck in here. um is that you saw he snuck in here. um is that you know the secretariat has a lot of CNAs know the secretariat has a lot of CNAs know the secretariat has a lot of CNAs to work with and it's got secretary to work with and it's got secretary to work with and it's got secretary duties and it's got developmental duties duties and it's got developmental duties duties and it's got developmental duties and it's got all this meeting stuff and and it's got all this meeting stuff and and it's got all this meeting stuff and you know they're they're heavy into the you know they're they're heavy into the you know they're they're heavy into the advent and you know you only spread so advent and you know you only spread so advent and you know you only spread so far. So that's one of the reasons we far. So that's one of the reasons we far. So that's one of the reasons we went for federation. went for federation. went for federation. So there's a problem of So there's a problem of So there's a problem of vendors that most people don't vendors that most people don't vendors that most people don't understand, especially those that say we understand, especially those that say we understand, especially those that say we can use the vendor from their uh you can use the vendor from their uh you can use the vendor from their uh you know their DNS entry, right? know their DNS entry, right? know their DNS entry, right? About half of our third parties have About half of our third parties have About half of our third parties have names of one or two people or names of one or two people or names of one or two people or three or some of them even say and three or some of them even say and three or some of them even say and friends, you know, cuz Oh, you mean for friends, you know, cuz Oh, you mean for friends, you know, cuz Oh, you mean for the upstream? For the name of the the upstream? For the name of the the upstream? For the name of the vendor. Oh, for the name of the vendor. vendor. Oh, for the name of the vendor. vendor. Oh, for the name of the vendor. Okay. Peter Schmidt and Joe Blow from Okay. Peter Schmidt and Joe Blow from Okay. Peter Schmidt and Joe Blow from and their friends. I'm not making this and their friends. I'm not making this and their friends. I'm not making this up. up. up. In fact, you know, if if it was useful, In fact, you know, if if it was useful, In fact, you know, if if it was useful, I could give you, you know, list of I could give you, you know, list of I could give you, you know, list of vendors in quote that we get from, you vendors in quote that we get from, you vendors in quote that we get from, you know, if that would be helpful for, you know, if that would be helpful for, you know, if that would be helpful for, you know, some of the some of the activities know, some of the some of the activities know, some of the some of the activities probably useful just uh to make sure we probably useful just uh to make sure we probably useful just uh to make sure we don't discount something. Yeah, because don't discount something. Yeah, because don't discount something. Yeah, because the solutions need to work for the solutions need to work for the solutions need to work for half of our vendors. I'll just say it's half of our vendors. I'll just say it's half of our vendors. I'll just say it's half. Yeah. Christina, I asked you to half. Yeah. Christina, I asked you to half. Yeah. Christina, I asked you to hold a thought. I hope you didn't forget hold a thought. I hope you didn't forget hold a thought. I hope you didn't forget it. Oh, no, no, no. I've been I've been it. Oh, no, no, no. I've been I've been it. Oh, no, no, no. I've been I've been waiting to change the subject because I waiting to change the subject because I waiting to change the subject because I think naming is incredibly important, think naming is incredibly important, think naming is incredibly important, but I have another low to you that is but I have another low to you that is but I have another low to you that is even bigger than the naming problem and even bigger than the naming problem and even bigger than the naming problem and way harder to solve. I hope you're ready way harder to solve. I hope you're ready way harder to solve. I hope you're ready for it. Um, we call it internally the for it. Um, we call it internally the for it. Um, we call it internally the parent child problem. So, components are parent child problem. So, components are parent child problem. So, components are not just singular packages always. And not just singular packages always. And not just singular packages always. And you as a DRO provider know that better you as a DRO provider know that better you as a DRO provider know that better than anyone because you guys tend to than anyone because you guys tend to than anyone because you guys tend to take components and break them up into take components and break them up into take components and break them up into teeny tiny packages that get installed teeny tiny packages that get installed teeny tiny packages that get installed separately on your system as separately on your system as separately on your system as dependencies. Um how do you handle that dependencies. Um how do you handle that dependencies. Um how do you handle that hierarchical view of of CVEes and names hierarchical view of of CVEes and names hierarchical view of of CVEes and names both internally and how would you handle both internally and how would you handle both internally and how would you handle it for you know the the global product it for you know the the global product it for you know the the global product space? Uh, this problem I've been chasing ever Uh, this problem I've been chasing ever Uh, this problem I've been chasing ever since I got the red hat six years ago. since I got the red hat six years ago. since I got the red hat six years ago. Um, and if I told you how we did six Um, and if I told you how we did six Um, and if I told you how we did six years ago, I'd be embarrassed. years ago, I'd be embarrassed. years ago, I'd be embarrassed. I'm embarrassed about how we handle it I'm embarrassed about how we handle it I'm embarrassed about how we handle it internally now. So, don't be don't feel internally now. So, don't be don't feel internally now. So, don't be don't feel bad. We had deep knowledge on our bad. We had deep knowledge on our bad. We had deep knowledge on our products by flat file. products by flat file. products by flat file. By what? By file. Flat file. By what? By file. Flat file. By what? By file. Flat file. Like individuals. What are we talking Like individuals. What are we talking Like individuals. What are we talking here? Yeah, like the product. It was a here? Yeah, like the product. It was a here? Yeah, like the product. It was a it was a flat file list of what we had it was a flat file list of what we had it was a flat file list of what we had and the guy who was responsible. That's and the guy who was responsible. That's and the guy who was responsible. That's why I had almost 80 person. why I had almost 80 person. why I had almost 80 person. Wow. Didn't scale because at certain Wow. Didn't scale because at certain Wow. Didn't scale because at certain point you'd get to be very point you'd get to be very point you'd get to be very expensive. So now expensive. So now expensive. So now uh last uh last uh last year I wrote and got a pie policy year I wrote and got a pie policy year I wrote and got a pie policy uh for manifesting. uh for manifesting. uh for manifesting. For what? Manifesting. Okay. So I For what? Manifesting. Okay. So I For what? Manifesting. Okay. So I mandated everyone had to had to do it. mandated everyone had to had to do it. mandated everyone had to had to do it. Now it was a big change for me because Now it was a big change for me because Now it was a big change for me because instead of me translating what they all instead of me translating what they all instead of me translating what they all did, I made them put it in a language did, I made them put it in a language did, I made them put it in a language that would be easy for me to that would be easy for me to that would be easy for me to accept. Then I wrote the standard that accept. Then I wrote the standard that accept. Then I wrote the standard that supported the policy and said and it supported the policy and said and it supported the policy and said and it will be in this will be in this will be in this format. Then I realized I don't go and format. Then I realized I don't go and format. Then I realized I don't go and talk to product teams. I go to talk to product teams. I go to talk to product teams. I go to pipelines. I had to reduce the scale of pipelines. I had to reduce the scale of pipelines. I had to reduce the scale of my problem which is kind of what we're my problem which is kind of what we're my problem which is kind of what we're talking here. Okay. How do you reduce talking here. Okay. How do you reduce talking here. Okay. How do you reduce scale? make it so or how do you upscale scale? make it so or how do you upscale scale? make it so or how do you upscale it, whichever way you want to look at it, whichever way you want to look at it, whichever way you want to look at it. But I had to find a way that I could it. But I had to find a way that I could it. But I had to find a way that I could eat not the elephant leg, not the eat not the elephant leg, not the eat not the elephant leg, not the elephant, but the herd of elephants. So in that I got to describe elephants. So in that I got to describe elephants. So in that I got to describe whether it was I think we went component whether it was I think we went component whether it was I think we went component package package package application. Uh I had to go check with application. Uh I had to go check with application. Uh I had to go check with Martin on that one. uh he may say it Martin on that one. uh he may say it Martin on that one. uh he may say it differently but you got the idea to to differently but you got the idea to to differently but you got the idea to to know what was there and then where do I know what was there and then where do I know what was there and then where do I see it repetably so now I know see it repetably so now I know see it repetably so now I know everywhere it everywhere it everywhere it is and I can at least spot it what I'm is and I can at least spot it what I'm is and I can at least spot it what I'm working through is what I call my layer working through is what I call my layer working through is what I call my layer problem which from an application is a problem which from an application is a problem which from an application is a dependency problem because now you're dependency problem because now you're dependency problem because now you're looking at how you deliver and who has looking at how you deliver and who has looking at how you deliver and who has to go first because you have a base that to go first because you have a base that to go first because you have a base that has to be fixed before you can move up, has to be fixed before you can move up, has to be fixed before you can move up, you know, your layers. Some of you do in you know, your layers. Some of you do in you know, your layers. Some of you do in parallel, you can't. And so we had to go parallel, you can't. And so we had to go parallel, you can't. And so we had to go and rethink our entire uh process. And and rethink our entire uh process. And and rethink our entire uh process. And what we've done for the last almost what we've done for the last almost what we've done for the last almost three years is redesign everything we three years is redesign everything we three years is redesign everything we were doing and not miss anything while were doing and not miss anything while were doing and not miss anything while we're doing it, which I'll be honest we're doing it, which I'll be honest we're doing it, which I'll be honest with you, sometimes we were better at with you, sometimes we were better at with you, sometimes we were better at than others because there's a certain than others because there's a certain than others because there's a certain point when you make a switch, you're point when you make a switch, you're point when you make a switch, you're going to hit going to hit going to hit that drop and you got to find a way to that drop and you got to find a way to that drop and you got to find a way to catch up. So, it's it's something that catch up. So, it's it's something that catch up. So, it's it's something that we worked real hard on. our our question we worked real hard on. our our question we worked real hard on. our our question and maybe this is the right way to bring and maybe this is the right way to bring and maybe this is the right way to bring it up it up it up is instead of this and and we talk about is instead of this and and we talk about is instead of this and and we talk about this in the piece of sig 10 years ago we this in the piece of sig 10 years ago we this in the piece of sig 10 years ago we had a session where we had an opening had a session where we had an opening had a session where we had an opening and we just went down the rows and asked and we just went down the rows and asked and we just went down the rows and asked everyone how they were doing their everyone how they were doing their everyone how they were doing their instant response and we had a lot of instant response and we had a lot of instant response and we had a lot of service now which we don't like jiraas service now which we don't like jiraas service now which we don't like jiraas which we didn't like a lot but I think which we didn't like a lot but I think which we didn't like a lot but I think we're using more but do we actually we're using more but do we actually we're using more but do we actually design more open source wise design more open source wise design more open source wise collectively collectively collectively some of this to support what we're doing some of this to support what we're doing some of this to support what we're doing instead of doing it one off to meet the instead of doing it one off to meet the instead of doing it one off to meet the same thing. Maybe we should just same thing. Maybe we should just same thing. Maybe we should just collectively look at how do we bring it collectively look at how do we bring it collectively look at how do we bring it together to do that so we don't keep together to do that so we don't keep together to do that so we don't keep fighting each other about what it's fighting each other about what it's fighting each other about what it's called revolutionize please go with it. called revolutionize please go with it. called revolutionize please go with it. Oh yeah. Yeah. Um I think uh in the open Oh yeah. Yeah. Um I think uh in the open Oh yeah. Yeah. Um I think uh in the open source open SSF uh we've started to source open SSF uh we've started to source open SSF uh we've started to explore the idea of namespacing for a explore the idea of namespacing for a explore the idea of namespacing for a lot of this. I think you still run into lot of this. I think you still run into lot of this. I think you still run into an issue where it's the alias issue as an issue where it's the alias issue as an issue where it's the alias issue as well which is in the context of this I'm well which is in the context of this I'm well which is in the context of this I'm going to call it system. Um you might going to call it system. Um you might going to call it system. Um you might have 12 layers of components and then have 12 layers of components and then have 12 layers of components and then down here is a thing but in a different down here is a thing but in a different down here is a thing but in a different context that's a top level component. context that's a top level component. context that's a top level component. Um, and then how do you sort of satisfy Um, and then how do you sort of satisfy Um, and then how do you sort of satisfy both of those use cases where you kind both of those use cases where you kind both of those use cases where you kind of want to say, you know, you have of want to say, you know, you have of want to say, you know, you have something called Z down here and you something called Z down here and you something called Z down here and you have ALB slash whatever and in the have ALB slash whatever and in the have ALB slash whatever and in the context of context of context of that system whether it's an application that system whether it's an application that system whether it's an application or or maybe even a running system or or or maybe even a running system or or or maybe even a running system or whatever. Um but then in a separate whatever. Um but then in a separate whatever. Um but then in a separate context when you're just like hey I'm context when you're just like hey I'm context when you're just like hey I'm distributing that component Z it's just distributing that component Z it's just distributing that component Z it's just known as like this is what it's known as known as like this is what it's known as known as like this is what it's known as and I think and I think and I think um would love to to yes definitely work um would love to to yes definitely work um would love to to yes definitely work on that in the open. Um I think it needs on that in the open. Um I think it needs on that in the open. Um I think it needs to be flexible because different to be flexible because different to be flexible because different companies are going to want to still be companies are going to want to still be companies are going to want to still be able to say hey this is what we kind of able to say hey this is what we kind of able to say hey this is what we kind of call it. Um there need should be some call it. Um there need should be some call it. Um there need should be some sort of unique identifier whether it's a sort of unique identifier whether it's a sort of unique identifier whether it's a grid or omni board identifier or grid or omni board identifier or grid or omni board identifier or something. there needs to be some way to something. there needs to be some way to something. there needs to be some way to uniquely identify it, but then it's uniquely identify it, but then it's uniquely identify it, but then it's going to be called different things in going to be called different things in going to be called different things in different contexts. And having that name different contexts. And having that name different contexts. And having that name spacing where, you know, Alice owns A spacing where, you know, Alice owns A spacing where, you know, Alice owns A and everything underneath it, Bob owns B and everything underneath it, Bob owns B and everything underneath it, Bob owns B and everything underneath it and and so and everything underneath it and and so and everything underneath it and and so on is also going to be um super on is also going to be um super on is also going to be um super important. Uh because we're running into important. Uh because we're running into important. Uh because we're running into a lot of that right now. And then a lot of that right now. And then a lot of that right now. And then internally, a lot of our customers are internally, a lot of our customers are internally, a lot of our customers are saying the same thing. They want to say saying the same thing. They want to say saying the same thing. They want to say hey Alice owns the department and all hey Alice owns the department and all hey Alice owns the department and all the sort of components and and and CVEes the sort of components and and and CVEes the sort of components and and and CVEes that belong not the department but owns that belong not the department but owns that belong not the department but owns this SAS and all the things underneath this SAS and all the things underneath this SAS and all the things underneath it, right? And then Bob owns the you it, right? And then Bob owns the you it, right? And then Bob owns the you know API service know API service know API service subcomponent and owns everything subcomponent and owns everything subcomponent and owns everything underneath it. And then at some point underneath it. And then at some point underneath it. And then at some point you have, you know, you have, you know, you have, you know, um, Charles or whomever who owns like um, Charles or whomever who owns like um, Charles or whomever who owns like this one piece of software and then is this one piece of software and then is this one piece of software and then is responsible for fixing the CVEEs in responsible for fixing the CVEEs in responsible for fixing the CVEEs in that. Um, and how do you kind of get it that. Um, and how do you kind of get it that. Um, and how do you kind of get it to that point where you get that to that point where you get that to that point where you get that hierarchy and you get that ability to hierarchy and you get that ability to hierarchy and you get that ability to see into all of that um, without it see into all of that um, without it see into all of that um, without it being being being um, just a nightmare? I don't know. I um, just a nightmare? I don't know. I um, just a nightmare? I don't know. I don't because it's already a rat's nest don't because it's already a rat's nest don't because it's already a rat's nest as it is. Yeah. You you described as it is. Yeah. You you described as it is. Yeah. You you described Nirvana. Um I'd love to get to that. I I Nirvana. Um I'd love to get to that. I I Nirvana. Um I'd love to get to that. I I don't know how I break that uh don't know how I break that uh don't know how I break that uh historical precedent of we've always historical precedent of we've always historical precedent of we've always done it this way and we like having it done it this way and we like having it done it this way and we like having it here. Well, tracking the hierarchy is here. Well, tracking the hierarchy is here. Well, tracking the hierarchy is one thing because the hierarchy is going one thing because the hierarchy is going one thing because the hierarchy is going to look different in different name to look different in different name to look different in different name spaces like you mentioned. Um, and SPDX spaces like you mentioned. Um, and SPDX spaces like you mentioned. Um, and SPDX sort of um has approached trying to sort of um has approached trying to sort of um has approached trying to track the hierarchy, but I don't think track the hierarchy, but I don't think track the hierarchy, but I don't think it went far enough. So, they added the it went far enough. So, they added the it went far enough. So, they added the ability, even though it's kind of like a ability, even though it's kind of like a ability, even though it's kind of like a flat sbomb, but they added the ability flat sbomb, but they added the ability flat sbomb, but they added the ability to track relationships between to track relationships between to track relationships between components. Um, but it it's still really components. Um, but it it's still really components. Um, but it it's still really like just an add-on rather than seeing like just an add-on rather than seeing like just an add-on rather than seeing it from a it from a it from a hierarchical view, right, from the top hierarchical view, right, from the top hierarchical view, right, from the top down. And to give an example like you down. And to give an example like you down. And to give an example like you know, if I am tracking NVD's OpenSSL um know, if I am tracking NVD's OpenSSL um know, if I am tracking NVD's OpenSSL um or you know, you have or you know, you have or you know, you have OpenSSL-IBs and and you might have other OpenSSL-IBs and and you might have other OpenSSL-IBs and and you might have other packages that it depends on. How are you packages that it depends on. How are you packages that it depends on. How are you tracking the CVE at the top tracking the CVE at the top tracking the CVE at the top level for example in Red Hat all the way level for example in Red Hat all the way level for example in Red Hat all the way down through those libraries and which down through those libraries and which down through those libraries and which it applies to. it applies to. it applies to. So we tried simplifying by putting So we tried simplifying by putting So we tried simplifying by putting OpenSSL through RE. So if you need again OpenSSL through RE. So if you need again OpenSSL through RE. So if you need again through re so you have to have re in through re so you have to have re in through re so you have to have re in your container or image wherever you're your container or image wherever you're your container or image wherever you're going. So we focus there. Now the the going. So we focus there. Now the the going. So we focus there. Now the the problem with open SSL is problem with open SSL is problem with open SSL is pips which is a different problem. pips which is a different problem. pips which is a different problem. That's a problem. Okay. But because you That's a problem. Okay. But because you That's a problem. Okay. But because you have to look at that and then you got have to look at that and then you got have to look at that and then you got PQC which is a different problem but PQC which is a different problem but PQC which is a different problem but similar is how do you manage your crypto similar is how do you manage your crypto similar is how do you manage your crypto and so that becomes a whole different and so that becomes a whole different and so that becomes a whole different problem and that's why we we directed it problem and that's why we we directed it problem and that's why we we directed it through RE because now we went down to through RE because now we went down to through RE because now we went down to that one name uh department I'll use that one name uh department I'll use that one name uh department I'll use your example is that department is the your example is that department is the your example is that department is the only ones who will fix that and now we only ones who will fix that and now we only ones who will fix that and now we know everyone has to pull it from there. know everyone has to pull it from there. know everyone has to pull it from there. So now I just track it where they pull So now I just track it where they pull So now I just track it where they pull it from there and that becomes a it from there and that becomes a it from there and that becomes a dependency. So that was my way of uh dependency. So that was my way of uh dependency. So that was my way of uh luckily engineering I didn't have to luckily engineering I didn't have to luckily engineering I didn't have to fight them. I actually just followed fight them. I actually just followed fight them. I actually just followed along with them. But that's just one along with them. But that's just one along with them. But that's just one example. There's there's just tons of example. There's there's just tons of example. There's there's just tons of libraries that have a libs appended to libraries that have a libs appended to libraries that have a libs appended to them, right? Red Hat just separates out them, right? Red Hat just separates out them, right? Red Hat just separates out everything into little tiny components. everything into little tiny components. everything into little tiny components. So the the problem for us is and I can So the the problem for us is and I can So the the problem for us is and I can only describe this way is we try to only describe this way is we try to only describe this way is we try to register everything and then reposit register everything and then reposit register everything and then reposit everything. And if I can register it, everything. And if I can register it, everything. And if I can register it, then I know in a manifest where it then I know in a manifest where it then I know in a manifest where it should be and then what I'm checking in should be and then what I'm checking in should be and then what I'm checking in our SDL is it actually pull it from our SDL is it actually pull it from our SDL is it actually pull it from there and then you know final check as there and then you know final check as there and then you know final check as we do the build. Is that where it came we do the build. Is that where it came we do the build. Is that where it came from? Because we had the licensing path from? Because we had the licensing path from? Because we had the licensing path we have to go check which Bruce talked we have to go check which Bruce talked we have to go check which Bruce talked about a little bit and and those have to about a little bit and and those have to about a little bit and and those have to be able to support each other. That was be able to support each other. That was be able to support each other. That was the only way I know to to get there with the only way I know to to get there with the only way I know to to get there with any degree any degree any degree of comprehension and and speed. And your of comprehension and and speed. And your of comprehension and and speed. And your answer to that tracking of CDES is VEX answer to that tracking of CDES is VEX answer to that tracking of CDES is VEX documents. That's my external. Yeah. documents. That's my external. Yeah. documents. That's my external. Yeah. Okay. But how do we translate that sort Okay. But how do we translate that sort Okay. But how do we translate that sort of namespace tracking to something like of namespace tracking to something like of namespace tracking to something like MITER or C? So in this case, if I said MITER or C? So in this case, if I said MITER or C? So in this case, if I said um what do I pick? um what do I pick? um what do I pick? I'll just call G. Let's see. Okay, good. I'll just call G. Let's see. Okay, good. I'll just call G. Let's see. Okay, good. That's a great one. That's a great one. That's a great one. I can't believe I picked that one. I can't believe I picked that one. I can't believe I picked that one. Um because now we got a CVE and everyone Um because now we got a CVE and everyone Um because now we got a CVE and everyone will talk about it's it's a problem, will talk about it's it's a problem, will talk about it's it's a problem, right? And let's say it's in the API but right? And let's say it's in the API but right? And let's say it's in the API but it's not in some of the other it's not in some of the other it's not in some of the other functions. Then when a customer gets it, functions. Then when a customer gets it, functions. Then when a customer gets it, their scanner their scanner their scanner triggers and I go back and say, "Wait a triggers and I go back and say, "Wait a triggers and I go back and say, "Wait a minute. Read the description. read the minute. Read the description. read the minute. Read the description. read the VEX file. It actually says, you know, VEX file. It actually says, you know, VEX file. It actually says, you know, we're calling the function and the API we're calling the function and the API we're calling the function and the API is not exposed to, you know, the is not exposed to, you know, the is not exposed to, you know, the internet. It it doesn't have a DAM in internet. It it doesn't have a DAM in internet. It it doesn't have a DAM in there to run it, etc. Now, that's not there to run it, etc. Now, that's not there to run it, etc. Now, that's not vulnerable. But a mature scanner will vulnerable. But a mature scanner will vulnerable. But a mature scanner will already know that it's running in Red already know that it's running in Red already know that it's running in Red Hat and Red Hat security advisories Hat and Red Hat security advisories Hat and Red Hat security advisories would say not applicable. Right. It would say not applicable. Right. It would say not applicable. Right. It should and they should uh but you're should and they should uh but you're should and they should uh but you're assuming the level maturity is higher. assuming the level maturity is higher. assuming the level maturity is higher. Oh, okay. My experience has not wore Oh, okay. My experience has not wore Oh, okay. My experience has not wore that to be true. I'm not saying it's not that to be true. I'm not saying it's not that to be true. I'm not saying it's not there. I just haven't seen it. Go ahead, there. I just haven't seen it. Go ahead, there. I just haven't seen it. Go ahead, Lisa. I just wanted to make a statement Lisa. I just wanted to make a statement Lisa. I just wanted to make a statement before our time is up here that after before our time is up here that after before our time is up here that after listening to this conversation, I sort listening to this conversation, I sort listening to this conversation, I sort of have impostor syndrome because I just of have impostor syndrome because I just of have impostor syndrome because I just started I worked with Chris Turner quite started I worked with Chris Turner quite started I worked with Chris Turner quite a bit, but I just started assigning CPEs a bit, but I just started assigning CPEs a bit, but I just started assigning CPEs based on what NBD was doing and I did it based on what NBD was doing and I did it based on what NBD was doing and I did it for every single product that we have. for every single product that we have. for every single product that we have. Now, am I doing it wrong? I don't know. Now, am I doing it wrong? I don't know. Now, am I doing it wrong? I don't know. But nobody's yelling at me. But nobody's yelling at me. But nobody's yelling at me. So, but So, but So, but but give me feedback if we are doing it but give me feedback if we are doing it but give me feedback if we are doing it wrong. I just started doing it. I think wrong. I just started doing it. I think wrong. I just started doing it. I think you're doing it different, but you had a you're doing it different, but you had a you're doing it different, but you had a slightly different construct than I slightly different construct than I slightly different construct than I have. Okay. I'm not going to speak for have. Okay. I'm not going to speak for have. Okay. I'm not going to speak for everyone else because of where I'm everyone else because of where I'm everyone else because of where I'm pulling my packages and and that it's pulling my packages and and that it's pulling my packages and and that it's basically basically basically some% 90 some percent external and uh some% 90 some percent external and uh some% 90 some percent external and uh probably a little higher than that and probably a little higher than that and probably a little higher than that and and I modify things and I and I package and I modify things and I and I package and I modify things and I and I package things and you know when I start doing things and you know when I start doing things and you know when I start doing things internally I either write code or things internally I either write code or things internally I either write code or I am now taking uh no longer maintain I am now taking uh no longer maintain I am now taking uh no longer maintain upstream and I now fork code and it's a upstream and I now fork code and it's a upstream and I now fork code and it's a totally different ball of wax than what totally different ball of wax than what totally different ball of wax than what you're doing because you already own you're doing because you already own you're doing because you already own that code from before. You don't have that code from before. You don't have that code from before. You don't have the problem of following upstream that I the problem of following upstream that I the problem of following upstream that I do and the naming convention I do. So do and the naming convention I do. So do and the naming convention I do. So it's easier for you to extend what NBD it's easier for you to extend what NBD it's easier for you to extend what NBD already had. So I don't think you're already had. So I don't think you're already had. So I don't think you're wrong. wrong. wrong. I'm not useful. I I I think you I'm not useful. I I I think you I'm not useful. I I I think you have I'll say unfair advantage. Dang it. have I'll say unfair advantage. Dang it. have I'll say unfair advantage. Dang it. Uh and good for you. You know, if if Uh and good for you. You know, if if Uh and good for you. You know, if if that works and it works for the system, that works and it works for the system, that works and it works for the system, uh why change? Now the question is for uh why change? Now the question is for uh why change? Now the question is for the rest of us if we can't follow that the rest of us if we can't follow that the rest of us if we can't follow that what can we do so we can be what can we do so we can be what can we do so we can be representative of the software like you representative of the software like you representative of the software like you are going to assume it works and it's are going to assume it works and it's are going to assume it works and it's correct and no one's hollering don't correct and no one's hollering don't correct and no one's hollering don't break it. break it. break it. Hey I won't feel like an imposter then Hey I won't feel like an imposter then Hey I won't feel like an imposter then I'm an imposttor don't but I'm open to I'm an imposttor don't but I'm open to I'm an imposttor don't but I'm open to suggestions if anybody thinks I'm doing suggestions if anybody thinks I'm doing suggestions if anybody thinks I'm doing it wrong. So, I don't know if I really answered So, I don't know if I really answered So, I don't know if I really answered your question. It's kind of like, oh, we your question. It's kind of like, oh, we your question. It's kind of like, oh, we we'd have to sit down and like have a we'd have to sit down and like have a we'd have to sit down and like have a whiteboard. I was bringing it up to put whiteboard. I was bringing it up to put whiteboard. I was bringing it up to put it on the scratch pad like, you know, I it on the scratch pad like, you know, I it on the scratch pad like, you know, I think Chris and I have that one because think Chris and I have that one because think Chris and I have that one because the beauty is my Martin is the co-chair the beauty is my Martin is the co-chair the beauty is my Martin is the co-chair on on on AWG. So, sometimes I don't worry about AWG. So, sometimes I don't worry about AWG. So, sometimes I don't worry about it because he's got it figured out for it because he's got it figured out for it because he's got it figured out for me. Later on, he's got to educate me so me. Later on, he's got to educate me so me. Later on, he's got to educate me so I say it correctly. But, one one more I say it correctly. But, one one more I say it correctly. But, one one more quick thing while I have the mic. I quick thing while I have the mic. I quick thing while I have the mic. I brought this up in the previous session, brought this up in the previous session, brought this up in the previous session, not this one but uh one earlier. Um I not this one but uh one earlier. Um I not this one but uh one earlier. Um I had a controversial idea especially back had a controversial idea especially back had a controversial idea especially back related to you know uh CNAs. Uh I don't related to you know uh CNAs. Uh I don't related to you know uh CNAs. Uh I don't think CNAs should be the only one who think CNAs should be the only one who think CNAs should be the only one who should be able to assign CPEs or pearls should be able to assign CPEs or pearls should be able to assign CPEs or pearls to CBE records. Um, I know that might be to CBE records. Um, I know that might be to CBE records. Um, I know that might be controversial to some, but controversial to some, but controversial to some, but Oh, so you're saying that other entities Oh, so you're saying that other entities Oh, so you're saying that other entities should be able to assign or add CPDs and should be able to assign or add CPDs and should be able to assign or add CPDs and pearls to a record. If you meet a bare pearls to a record. If you meet a bare pearls to a record. If you meet a bare minimum of having an ID, right? And you minimum of having an ID, right? And you minimum of having an ID, right? And you know that a CVE affect your product, you know that a CVE affect your product, you know that a CVE affect your product, you should be able to add it. So we do that should be able to add it. So we do that should be able to add it. So we do that with the container model within the CVE with the container model within the CVE with the container model within the CVE record today. So I don't know if you've record today. So I don't know if you've record today. So I don't know if you've noticed like CISA adds enriched data to noticed like CISA adds enriched data to noticed like CISA adds enriched data to a lot of records that includes CPE. Go a lot of records that includes CPE. Go a lot of records that includes CPE. Go ahead Alec. ahead Alec. ahead Alec. Oh no no it's okay. Yeah I I was think Oh no no it's okay. Yeah I I was think Oh no no it's okay. Yeah I I was think it was my software identity thing it was my software identity thing it was my software identity thing brothers. So I think the issue at hand brothers. So I think the issue at hand brothers. So I think the issue at hand actually is the suggestion that when actually is the suggestion that when actually is the suggestion that when Megazin was in the room and answered was Megazin was in the room and answered was Megazin was in the room and answered was this idea that the concept for example this idea that the concept for example this idea that the concept for example that using the container method that you that using the container method that you that using the container method that you mentioned um CNAs may be able to provide mentioned um CNAs may be able to provide mentioned um CNAs may be able to provide their own uh data for relevance of that record to uh data for relevance of that record to uh data for relevance of that record to their own you know their own advisory their own you know their own advisory their own you know their own advisory related to this vulnerability right and related to this vulnerability right and related to this vulnerability right and So the idea like we have this vehicle So the idea like we have this vehicle So the idea like we have this vehicle now in the ecosystem called an ADP right now in the ecosystem called an ADP right now in the ecosystem called an ADP right and and and you mentioned the one that's and and and you mentioned the one that's and and and you mentioned the one that's used right which is to add data to used right which is to add data to used right which is to add data to another CNA's record and this is one another CNA's record and this is one another CNA's record and this is one element of that data that's been element of that data that's been element of that data that's been discussed at length but that's not been discussed at length but that's not been discussed at length but that's not been resolved and that's one of those resolved and that's one of those resolved and that's one of those solutions is like well if everybody was solutions is like well if everybody was solutions is like well if everybody was a able to use this ADP technology to a able to use this ADP technology to a able to use this ADP technology to provide relevance for their their own provide relevance for their their own provide relevance for their their own shop regarding that vulnerability. I shop regarding that vulnerability. I shop regarding that vulnerability. I would take it further and say that even would take it further and say that even would take it further and say that even the distros and other package managers the distros and other package managers the distros and other package managers should be able to provide relevant should be able to provide relevant should be able to provide relevant information. So we're talking on like information. So we're talking on like information. So we're talking on like it's for kernel do the Linux packages it's for kernel do the Linux packages it's for kernel do the Linux packages and and that's a conversation between and and that's a conversation between and and that's a conversation between kernel and Linux packages. I think for kernel and Linux packages. I think for kernel and Linux packages. I think for what uh Alec just spoke to. I'd rather what uh Alec just spoke to. I'd rather what uh Alec just spoke to. I'd rather we get the definition of what it is for we get the definition of what it is for we get the definition of what it is for our go forward and then look about do we our go forward and then look about do we our go forward and then look about do we need to be an ADP for our old records. I need to be an ADP for our old records. I need to be an ADP for our old records. I think that's really instead of going think that's really instead of going think that's really instead of going back and back and back and and recreating every record, I think we and recreating every record, I think we and recreating every record, I think we go back and you can ADP your records go back and you can ADP your records go back and you can ADP your records either in a sequential backwards or as either in a sequential backwards or as either in a sequential backwards or as uh you get engaged about that problem uh you get engaged about that problem uh you get engaged about that problem set. Question is, do you do all of it? set. Question is, do you do all of it? set. Question is, do you do all of it? And I I don't think you should do all of And I I don't think you should do all of And I I don't think you should do all of it. That's just work for nothing. Um so late to the party and um maybe Um so late to the party and um maybe Um so late to the party and um maybe just halfway connected to your previous just halfway connected to your previous just halfway connected to your previous discussions but kind of a comment to discussions but kind of a comment to discussions but kind of a comment to what you're saying is that we as a what you're saying is that we as a what you're saying is that we as a vendor would really like to be an ADP. I vendor would really like to be an ADP. I vendor would really like to be an ADP. I think I brought that up last year. I'm think I brought that up last year. I'm think I brought that up last year. I'm really happy that this is now going to really happy that this is now going to really happy that this is now going to be a thing. Uh please tell me on how we be a thing. Uh please tell me on how we be a thing. Uh please tell me on how we can do that. can do that. can do that. But But But uh so then then the question uh the uh so then then the question uh the uh so then then the question uh the second question would be that we would second question would be that we would second question would be that we would want to basically connect the uh want to basically connect the uh want to basically connect the uh question of naming and basically routing question of naming and basically routing question of naming and basically routing in the vulnerability realm um with that in the vulnerability realm um with that in the vulnerability realm um with that feature because what you what we have is feature because what you what we have is feature because what you what we have is basically a set of sbombs for each basically a set of sbombs for each basically a set of sbombs for each product where we say like this thingy product where we say like this thingy product where we say like this thingy whatever we name it contains these whatever we name it contains these whatever we name it contains these components but what we didn't think components but what we didn't think components but what we didn't think about from my perspective is like the about from my perspective is like the about from my perspective is like the root of the asbomb also has a name root of the asbomb also has a name root of the asbomb also has a name because it's obviously a node that is because it's obviously a node that is because it's obviously a node that is affected and I think those pro uh affected and I think those pro uh affected and I think those pro uh concepts somehow should be able to be concepts somehow should be able to be concepts somehow should be able to be brought together in a way that for kind brought together in a way that for kind brought together in a way that for kind of the CVE assessment and all the the of the CVE assessment and all the the of the CVE assessment and all the the information that we publish it's not information that we publish it's not information that we publish it's not that we only want to say like okay we that we only want to say like okay we that we only want to say like okay we have also something to that CVE to say have also something to that CVE to say have also something to that CVE to say so we are an ADP and say like okay we so we are an ADP and say like okay we so we are an ADP and say like okay we are also affected by this but we would are also affected by this but we would are also affected by this but we would want to say like even we are affected by want to say like even we are affected by want to say like even we are affected by this because of that upstream component this because of that upstream component this because of that upstream component in our asbomb because uh there might be in our asbomb because uh there might be in our asbomb because uh there might be and I think some some of you you might and I think some some of you you might and I think some some of you you might know due to the release processes in know due to the release processes in know due to the release processes in different products it might be that in different products it might be that in different products it might be that in our in one solution or in one product our in one solution or in one product our in one solution or in one product that we sell we have like 12 different that we sell we have like 12 different that we sell we have like 12 different versions of OpenSL like two versions of versions of OpenSL like two versions of versions of OpenSL like two versions of Debian one version of Redhead and kind Debian one version of Redhead and kind Debian one version of Redhead and kind of one upstream vanilla version for of one upstream vanilla version for of one upstream vanilla version for whatever reasons and then basically we whatever reasons and then basically we whatever reasons and then basically we might be affected of the same might be affected of the same might be affected of the same vulnerability four times based on vulnerability four times based on vulnerability four times based on different upstream dependencies. different upstream dependencies. different upstream dependencies. So basically that complicates the So basically that complicates the So basically that complicates the problems on so many multiple layers. But problems on so many multiple layers. But problems on so many multiple layers. But I thought maybe I bring this idea into I thought maybe I bring this idea into I thought maybe I bring this idea into the uh discussion and kind of in one the uh discussion and kind of in one the uh discussion and kind of in one sentence what do I want if I can um add sentence what do I want if I can um add sentence what do I want if I can um add the information for downstream the information for downstream the information for downstream components in the CVE program. Can I components in the CVE program. Can I components in the CVE program. Can I please also add which upstream please also add which upstream please also add which upstream component made me affected? Yep. Yep. component made me affected? Yep. Yep. component made me affected? Yep. Yep. There there have been some discussions There there have been some discussions There there have been some discussions on that internally. Um but but yeah, I on that internally. Um but but yeah, I on that internally. Um but but yeah, I think we're we're getting cut off, so we think we're we're getting cut off, so we think we're we're getting cut off, so we can talk about it afterwards. can talk about it afterwards. can talk about it afterwards. It was a good opening session. Thanks It was a good opening session. Thanks It was a good opening session. Thanks for Yep. Thank you uh Pete and Chris for for Yep. Thank you uh Pete and Chris for for Yep. Thank you uh Pete and Chris for leading that uh that great discussion. leading that uh that great discussion. leading that uh that great discussion. Um really fantastic interaction. So um Um really fantastic interaction. So um Um really fantastic interaction. So um for on-site participants, we don't have for on-site participants, we don't have for on-site participants, we don't have anything else in this room yet today. So anything else in this room yet today. So anything else in this room yet today. So if you want to stay here and work or if you want to stay here and work or if you want to stay here and work or whatever, uh the site's open uh for whatever, uh the site's open uh for whatever, uh the site's open uh for those uh well onsite and virtual. There those uh well onsite and virtual. There those uh well onsite and virtual. There is one other session happening at 3 CNA is one other session happening at 3 CNA is one other session happening at 3 CNA birds of a feather open forum with birds of a feather open forum with birds of a feather open forum with certified naming authorities. So um feel certified naming authorities. So um feel certified naming authorities. So um feel free to slide on over to that one. free to slide on over to that one. free to slide on over to that one. Again, that's room 7 here and then a at Again, that's room 7 here and then a at Again, that's room 7 here and then a at 3:30. Uh all these times are in Eastern 3:30. Uh all these times are in Eastern 3:30. Uh all these times are in Eastern time. We do have a networking uh break time. We do have a networking uh break time. We do have a networking uh break with uh in the exhibitor's room in room with uh in the exhibitor's room in room with uh in the exhibitor's room in room two on site. So then things will be two on site. So then things will be two on site. So then things will be picking back up at 4 Eastern uh in picking back up at 4 Eastern uh in picking back up at 4 Eastern uh in earnest and then we'll be going to uh 4 earnest and then we'll be going to uh 4 earnest and then we'll be going to uh 4 to 5. So uh yeah, thanks everybody and to 5. So uh yeah, thanks everybody and to 5. So uh yeah, thanks everybody and uh we will check Discord to see if uh we will check Discord to see if uh we will check Discord to see if there's any additional questions. So uh there's any additional questions. So uh there's any additional questions. So uh perhaps we can ask Pete and Chris to perhaps we can ask Pete and Chris to perhaps we can ask Pete and Chris to check the Discord channel for this one. check the Discord channel for this one. check the Discord channel for this one. I think there was one question from I think there was one question from I think there was one question from earlier that that didn't get answered. earlier that that didn't get answered. earlier that that didn't get answered. Um so if you get a chance, take a look Um so if you get a chance, take a look Um so if you get a chance, take a look at that. Thanks everybody.
