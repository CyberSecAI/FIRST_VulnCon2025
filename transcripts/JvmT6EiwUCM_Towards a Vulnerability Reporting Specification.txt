Kind: captions Language: en Hi everyone and welcome to this just Hi everyone and welcome to this just Hi everyone and welcome to this just after launch talk. So we are going to after launch talk. So we are going to after launch talk. So we are going to have have have a interesting time to have you running a interesting time to have you running a interesting time to have you running after lunch about after lunch about after lunch about specifications. So my name is Matinska specifications. So my name is Matinska specifications. So my name is Matinska and here's my colleague Mikuel. and here's my colleague Mikuel. and here's my colleague Mikuel. Oh yeah, my name is Mikuel Barau. I am Oh yeah, my name is Mikuel Barau. I am Oh yeah, my name is Mikuel Barau. I am head of security at the foundation. Um head of security at the foundation. Um head of security at the foundation. Um so for those who don't know about the so for those who don't know about the so for those who don't know about the Eclipse Foundation um we are an open Eclipse Foundation um we are an open Eclipse Foundation um we are an open source software foundation. So we host source software foundation. So we host source software foundation. So we host uh and steward open source projects. You uh and steward open source projects. You uh and steward open source projects. You may have heard about the Eclipse IDE. Uh may have heard about the Eclipse IDE. Uh may have heard about the Eclipse IDE. Uh a bit a bit a bit louder. Um about the Eclipse IDE. So it louder. Um about the Eclipse IDE. So it louder. Um about the Eclipse IDE. So it was our very first project 20 years ago. was our very first project 20 years ago. was our very first project 20 years ago. uh but we know host a widely diverse set uh but we know host a widely diverse set uh but we know host a widely diverse set of projects uh in the cloud native Java of projects uh in the cloud native Java of projects uh in the cloud native Java ecosystem but also in the IoT world or ecosystem but also in the IoT world or ecosystem but also in the IoT world or around the software defined vehicle um around the software defined vehicle um around the software defined vehicle um ecosystems. Um so as an open source ecosystems. Um so as an open source ecosystems. Um so as an open source software foundation we provide a set of software foundation we provide a set of software foundation we provide a set of services to our projects uh including um services to our projects uh including um services to our projects uh including um governance and stewardship. So we we governance and stewardship. So we we governance and stewardship. So we we ensure that the projects are run uh in a ensure that the projects are run uh in a ensure that the projects are run uh in a vendor neutral environment. We provide vendor neutral environment. We provide vendor neutral environment. We provide services around IP management and services around IP management and services around IP management and licensing uh management and we also licensing uh management and we also licensing uh management and we also provide marketing. We organize provide marketing. We organize provide marketing. We organize conferences so that basically we do conferences so that basically we do conferences so that basically we do everything so that our open source everything so that our open source everything so that our open source projects thrive. Um something that we we projects thrive. Um something that we we projects thrive. Um something that we we we do also is to provide uh IT we do also is to provide uh IT we do also is to provide uh IT infrastructure and we've been doing that infrastructure and we've been doing that infrastructure and we've been doing that for for a very long time. uh and a new for for a very long time. uh and a new for for a very long time. uh and a new thing that we've been focusing on for thing that we've been focusing on for thing that we've been focusing on for the last three years uh is around sec the last three years uh is around sec the last three years uh is around sec security with the the the last couple of security with the the the last couple of security with the the the last couple of major events that happen in security in major events that happen in security in major events that happen in security in open source speaking about shell of open source speaking about shell of open source speaking about shell of course but many others um we decided to course but many others um we decided to course but many others um we decided to uh invest heavily in providing better uh invest heavily in providing better uh invest heavily in providing better security uh better security services and security uh better security services and security uh better security services and um and tools to our projects and with um and tools to our projects and with um and tools to our projects and with that goal um given that the forthcoming that goal um given that the forthcoming that goal um given that the forthcoming regulation are happening around the regulation are happening around the regulation are happening around the world including in in the US but also in world including in in the US but also in world including in in the US but also in Europe with the the cyber residence act. Europe with the the cyber residence act. Europe with the the cyber residence act. We created a working group called open We created a working group called open We created a working group called open regulatory compliance to um gather key regulatory compliance to um gather key regulatory compliance to um gather key stakeholders from the industry and stakeholders from the industry and stakeholders from the industry and provide them with a neutral forum so provide them with a neutral forum so provide them with a neutral forum so that they can discuss and elaborate the that they can discuss and elaborate the that they can discuss and elaborate the specification um for open source specification um for open source specification um for open source projects in order to help uh the the key projects in order to help uh the the key projects in order to help uh the the key industry players to comply with the for industry players to comply with the for industry players to comply with the for forthcoming regulations. So we managed forthcoming regulations. So we managed forthcoming regulations. So we managed to gather stakeholders from um um widely to gather stakeholders from um um widely to gather stakeholders from um um widely diverse um diverse um diverse um um location of the ecosystems and we do um location of the ecosystems and we do um location of the ecosystems and we do that by uh the the goal of war is that by uh the the goal of war is that by uh the the goal of war is actually to provide the interface actually to provide the interface actually to provide the interface between those open source committees and between those open source committees and between those open source committees and those key stakeholders uh so that they those key stakeholders uh so that they those key stakeholders uh so that they can um uh they can communicate and they can um uh they can communicate and they can um uh they can communicate and they can interact directly with the can interact directly with the can interact directly with the regulators especially in Europe because regulators especially in Europe because regulators especially in Europe because we are focusing first with the CRA we are focusing first with the CRA we are focusing first with the CRA So currently the OC members um the the So currently the OC members um the the So currently the OC members um the the the members of the working group include the members of the working group include the members of the working group include in include large industries uh large in include large industries uh large in include large industries uh large manufacturers, software manufacturers in manufacturers, software manufacturers in manufacturers, software manufacturers in Europe uh but also in the US uh so that Europe uh but also in the US uh so that Europe uh but also in the US uh so that the top two lines uh with different the top two lines uh with different the top two lines uh with different level of involvement but one key uh level of involvement but one key uh level of involvement but one key uh feature of this working group is that we feature of this working group is that we feature of this working group is that we actually managed to gather uh most of actually managed to gather uh most of actually managed to gather uh most of the open source uh other open source the open source uh other open source the open source uh other open source foundation as well in this working foundation as well in this working foundation as well in this working group. So the Apache software group. So the Apache software group. So the Apache software foundation, the FreeBSD foundation, foundation, the FreeBSD foundation, foundation, the FreeBSD foundation, Python, Rust, PHP and what and so on and Python, Rust, PHP and what and so on and Python, Rust, PHP and what and so on and so on, they all came to the OC working so on, they all came to the OC working so on, they all came to the OC working group and they are all participating to group and they are all participating to group and they are all participating to the the writing of those specification the the writing of those specification the the writing of those specification for compliance with the for compliance with the for compliance with the um forthcoming um forthcoming um forthcoming regulations that the the participating regulations that the the participating regulations that the the participating sorry to the the writing of the sorry to the the writing of the sorry to the the writing of the specification for forthcoming um specification for forthcoming um specification for forthcoming um regulations. So as Mika has said the first focus of So as Mika has said the first focus of So as Mika has said the first focus of the OC is the cyber resilience act and the OC is the cyber resilience act and the OC is the cyber resilience act and the first focus that we have in this the first focus that we have in this the first focus that we have in this cyber resilience act work um is to have cyber resilience act work um is to have cyber resilience act work um is to have a look a look a look of and start writing a vulnerability of and start writing a vulnerability of and start writing a vulnerability management specification. Next slide, Nika. So, uh, what does the Next slide, Nika. So, uh, what does the Next slide, Nika. So, uh, what does the CRA say about vulnerability management? CRA say about vulnerability management? CRA say about vulnerability management? In fact, In fact, In fact, it talks a lot about vulnerability it talks a lot about vulnerability it talks a lot about vulnerability management. There is even a special part management. There is even a special part management. There is even a special part in the annex 2 in part two that is just in the annex 2 in part two that is just in the annex 2 in part two that is just talking about the vulnerability talking about the vulnerability talking about the vulnerability management. management. management. uh saying that the information about uh saying that the information about uh saying that the information about fixed vulnerabilities must be uh fixed vulnerabilities must be uh fixed vulnerabilities must be uh released that there must be a policy uh released that there must be a policy uh released that there must be a policy uh of coordinate vulnerability disclosure of coordinate vulnerability disclosure of coordinate vulnerability disclosure um and uh parties must um and uh parties must um and uh parties must communicate for example uh reporting communicate for example uh reporting communicate for example uh reporting upstream fund vulnerabilities and upstream fund vulnerabilities and upstream fund vulnerabilities and there's more there's way more um we also there's more there's way more um we also there's more there's way more um we also want to show a different fragment Next want to show a different fragment Next want to show a different fragment Next slide, slide, slide, Mika. Uh, that's the reset 76. That's Mika. Uh, that's the reset 76. That's Mika. Uh, that's the reset 76. That's also quite important for that. So, it's also quite important for that. So, it's also quite important for that. So, it's repeating the coordinated vulnerability repeating the coordinated vulnerability repeating the coordinated vulnerability disclosure disclosure disclosure policy and it requires policy and it requires policy and it requires um to have a structured um to have a structured um to have a structured process to deal with vulnerabilities. process to deal with vulnerabilities. process to deal with vulnerabilities. they uh ask if possible for machine they uh ask if possible for machine they uh ask if possible for machine readable adi security policies readable adi security policies readable adi security policies uh and they propose programs like bug uh and they propose programs like bug uh and they propose programs like bug bounties. So this is quite uh there's bounties. So this is quite uh there's bounties. So this is quite uh there's quite much uh that we have uh in the in quite much uh that we have uh in the in quite much uh that we have uh in the in the main text of the about vulnerability the main text of the about vulnerability the main text of the about vulnerability management that is not very surprising management that is not very surprising management that is not very surprising to people who do vulnerability to people who do vulnerability to people who do vulnerability management because there's management because there's management because there's uh nothing unexpected in there. Next I uh nothing unexpected in there. Next I uh nothing unexpected in there. Next I Nika. Nika. Nika. So of course we um as we we said we are So of course we um as we we said we are So of course we um as we we said we are focusing on vulnerability management and focusing on vulnerability management and focusing on vulnerability management and uh we said that we were writing a uh we said that we were writing a uh we said that we were writing a specification. The goal is not is specification. The goal is not is specification. The goal is not is definitely not to create one uh new definitely not to create one uh new definitely not to create one uh new specification or one new standard that specification or one new standard that specification or one new standard that will um uh that will unify all the will um uh that will unify all the will um uh that will unify all the definitions. Our goal is really to focus definitions. Our goal is really to focus definitions. Our goal is really to focus on the CRA requirements and to to to on the CRA requirements and to to to on the CRA requirements and to to to write those specifications. Um so let's write those specifications. Um so let's write those specifications. Um so let's take a look at why uh some other take a look at why uh some other take a look at why uh some other specification or standards um don't specification or standards um don't specification or standards um don't really apply or don't really fit our really apply or don't really fit our really apply or don't really fit our needs there. Of course there are the needs there. Of course there are the needs there. Of course there are the ISYC standards but as you know uh it's ISYC standards but as you know uh it's ISYC standards but as you know uh it's not available um for free and I'm using not available um for free and I'm using not available um for free and I'm using the word grat is there for emphasis on the word grat is there for emphasis on the word grat is there for emphasis on the money part and of course for open the money part and of course for open the money part and of course for open source communities it's most of the time source communities it's most of the time source communities it's most of the time know a know a know a showstopper. Then there are the the BSI showstopper. Then there are the the BSI showstopper. Then there are the the BSI technical recommendations uh especially technical recommendations uh especially technical recommendations uh especially the the path three about vulnerability the the path three about vulnerability the the path three about vulnerability report and notification but it's very report and notification but it's very report and notification but it's very heavily oriented toward enterprise usage heavily oriented toward enterprise usage heavily oriented toward enterprise usage and enterprise uh requirements for the and enterprise uh requirements for the and enterprise uh requirements for the CR. So doesn't really fit the the open CR. So doesn't really fit the the open CR. So doesn't really fit the the open source um requirements. Then there is source um requirements. Then there is source um requirements. Then there is the amazing work from the open SSF from the amazing work from the open SSF from the amazing work from the open SSF from the guide to implementing a CVD process. the guide to implementing a CVD process. the guide to implementing a CVD process. Uh we took a lot of inspiration from Uh we took a lot of inspiration from Uh we took a lot of inspiration from this and also from other standards. But this and also from other standards. But this and also from other standards. But the issue with this guide is that it's the issue with this guide is that it's the issue with this guide is that it's nonprescriptive. So you cannot really nonprescriptive. So you cannot really nonprescriptive. So you cannot really define by following this guide whether define by following this guide whether define by following this guide whether you comply or not with the requirements you comply or not with the requirements you comply or not with the requirements of the of the of the CRA and there's also the the the OS uh CRA and there's also the the the OS uh CRA and there's also the the the OS uh cheat sheet around vulnerability cheat sheet around vulnerability cheat sheet around vulnerability disclosure and same as for OpenSSF uh disclosure and same as for OpenSSF uh disclosure and same as for OpenSSF uh guide it's nonprescriptive so how to uh guide it's nonprescriptive so how to uh guide it's nonprescriptive so how to uh define compliance or not and there are define compliance or not and there are define compliance or not and there are also guide uh guides uh from the NIST um also guide uh guides uh from the NIST um also guide uh guides uh from the NIST um and other federal agencies so around and other federal agencies so around and other federal agencies so around vulnerability disclosure but it's very vulnerability disclosure but it's very vulnerability disclosure but it's very heavily um um directed for federal heavily um um directed for federal heavily um um directed for federal agencies and there is also the CIA the agencies and there is also the CIA the agencies and there is also the CIA the Caesar vulnerabilities templates but Caesar vulnerabilities templates but Caesar vulnerabilities templates but again it's only a template so doesn't again it's only a template so doesn't again it's only a template so doesn't provide you much uh in terms of um provide you much uh in terms of um provide you much uh in terms of um assessment for assessment for assessment for compliance so here we are really not uh compliance so here we are really not uh compliance so here we are really not uh trying to define yet another standard to trying to define yet another standard to trying to define yet another standard to unify them all to to to rule them all unify them all to to to rule them all unify them all to to to rule them all but uh specifically targeted to CRA but uh specifically targeted to CRA but uh specifically targeted to CRA compliance compliance compliance so uh we have so uh we have so uh we have five main goals in writing that five main goals in writing that five main goals in writing that specification. You probably already see specification. You probably already see specification. You probably already see them uh from uh from the description of them uh from uh from the description of them uh from uh from the description of other specifications and standards. So other specifications and standards. So other specifications and standards. So uh first um goal is to have a short uh first um goal is to have a short uh first um goal is to have a short document. uh we deal with open source document. uh we deal with open source document. uh we deal with open source projects. Quite often maintainers have projects. Quite often maintainers have projects. Quite often maintainers have have very limited time and having an 80 have very limited time and having an 80 have very limited time and having an 80 pages document to read to understand how pages document to read to understand how pages document to read to understand how they should run um vulnerability they should run um vulnerability they should run um vulnerability reporting that may be really a reporting that may be really a reporting that may be really a showstopper. So we want to have it as showstopper. So we want to have it as showstopper. So we want to have it as short as possible so it's easy to use short as possible so it's easy to use short as possible so it's easy to use and understand for every project even and understand for every project even and understand for every project even the smallest one. Then the smallest one. Then the smallest one. Then um we know that the um we know that the um we know that the community has been running vulnerability community has been running vulnerability community has been running vulnerability reporting processes for years and there reporting processes for years and there reporting processes for years and there are a lot of best are a lot of best are a lot of best practices. So we don't want to change practices. So we don't want to change practices. So we don't want to change practices that work. What we want to practices that work. What we want to practices that work. What we want to come with is a set of common standards, come with is a set of common standards, come with is a set of common standards, a common practices that everyone agrees a common practices that everyone agrees a common practices that everyone agrees on and we want to reach an agreement in on and we want to reach an agreement in on and we want to reach an agreement in the community of what is the core set the community of what is the core set the community of what is the core set that everyone agrees with. Of course, we that everyone agrees with. Of course, we that everyone agrees with. Of course, we want to have it consistent with the CRA want to have it consistent with the CRA want to have it consistent with the CRA uh because that's our main goal. uh then uh because that's our main goal. uh then uh because that's our main goal. uh then tailored for opensource tailored for opensource tailored for opensource but when we when we've been writing this but when we when we've been writing this but when we when we've been writing this we realized that for many companies that we realized that for many companies that we realized that for many companies that will also work just fine so they could will also work just fine so they could will also work just fine so they could use it this um uh specification as use it this um uh specification as use it this um uh specification as is. Then um we want to make it available is. Then um we want to make it available is. Then um we want to make it available to everyone. to everyone. to everyone. uh so uh use an open source license that uh so uh use an open source license that uh so uh use an open source license that allows that. So those are our fi our allows that. So those are our fi our allows that. So those are our fi our five main goals while uh working on the five main goals while uh working on the five main goals while uh working on the specification and then the next slide specification and then the next slide specification and then the next slide please. Uh then how did we approach it? please. Uh then how did we approach it? please. Uh then how did we approach it? So we assembled the best practices from So we assembled the best practices from So we assembled the best practices from the community to extract the main the community to extract the main the community to extract the main points and then uh we have created points and then uh we have created points and then uh we have created uh clear requirements, clear must uh clear requirements, clear must uh clear requirements, clear must shoots, recommended so that people can shoots, recommended so that people can shoots, recommended so that people can easily match their policy or they can easily match their policy or they can easily match their policy or they can easy create a policy. easy create a policy. easy create a policy. As said uh we are limiting the size As said uh we are limiting the size As said uh we are limiting the size trying to write it in a consistent way trying to write it in a consistent way trying to write it in a consistent way so it's easy to read and short. Of so it's easy to read and short. Of so it's easy to read and short. Of course uh we are working in an open course uh we are working in an open course uh we are working in an open source foundation with many open source source foundation with many open source source foundation with many open source foundations and companies working on foundations and companies working on foundations and companies working on open source. So this is a project under open source. So this is a project under open source. So this is a project under an open source license and um to let an open source license and um to let an open source license and um to let people use all the richness uh of the people use all the richness uh of the people use all the richness uh of the different different different uh guidelines that exist and people can uh guidelines that exist and people can uh guidelines that exist and people can use it. We link use it. We link use it. We link uh two different guidelines from the uh two different guidelines from the uh two different guidelines from the main documents to allow people to go uh main documents to allow people to go uh main documents to allow people to go uh and u find more information or more and u find more information or more and u find more information or more detailed processes if they detailed processes if they detailed processes if they want. Next slide. Yeah. So, uh where are we? The slide. Yeah. So, uh where are we? The slide. Yeah. So, uh where are we? The first draft is available and it's around first draft is available and it's around first draft is available and it's around two pages and discussions in the two pages and discussions in the two pages and discussions in the community has already community has already community has already started. Next slide. Um and as for any good opensource slide. Um and as for any good opensource slide. Um and as for any good opensource project it's available in git. So you project it's available in git. So you project it's available in git. So you can find it in the OC working group can find it in the OC working group can find it in the OC working group GitHub uh organization and you will find GitHub uh organization and you will find GitHub uh organization and you will find the vulnerability management spec. You the vulnerability management spec. You the vulnerability management spec. You can access can access can access it, comment, post your issues, post your it, comment, post your issues, post your it, comment, post your issues, post your pull request as in any open source pull request as in any open source pull request as in any open source project. Next slide. And the current state we have slide. And the current state we have slide. And the current state we have musts mains that musts mains that musts mains that fit on screen on a single screen. So the fit on screen on a single screen. So the fit on screen on a single screen. So the one must is to have a process of one must is to have a process of one must is to have a process of vulnerability handling. Another that we vulnerability handling. Another that we vulnerability handling. Another that we have put is a method without creating a have put is a method without creating a have put is a method without creating a separate account. then uh ading to separate account. then uh ading to separate account. then uh ading to coordinated vulnerability disclosure in coordinated vulnerability disclosure in coordinated vulnerability disclosure in opposition to no disclosure opposition to no disclosure opposition to no disclosure uh or full uh or full uh or full disclosure uh as it's it is uh defined disclosure uh as it's it is uh defined disclosure uh as it's it is uh defined uh according to CRA then uh according to CRA then uh according to CRA then uh we say must to uh link to the uh we say must to uh link to the uh we say must to uh link to the reporting policy reporting policy reporting policy um then clearly defining who as a person um then clearly defining who as a person um then clearly defining who as a person or a group in the organization is or a group in the organization is or a group in the organization is dealing with dealing with dealing with vulnerabilities. Uh a must for reporting vulnerabilities. Uh a must for reporting vulnerabilities. Uh a must for reporting to upstream projects and then publishing to upstream projects and then publishing to upstream projects and then publishing all resolve vulnerabilities. That is our all resolve vulnerabilities. That is our all resolve vulnerabilities. That is our list of must and there are some other list of must and there are some other list of must and there are some other shots and recommendations. So um obviously there is nothing So um obviously there is nothing So um obviously there is nothing shocking or nothing that should be um shocking or nothing that should be um shocking or nothing that should be um really controversy for for anybody really controversy for for anybody really controversy for for anybody attending to the conference today. Um attending to the conference today. Um attending to the conference today. Um but this is the the good enough set of but this is the the good enough set of but this is the the good enough set of specification that um we we find would specification that um we we find would specification that um we we find would meet uh the CRA requirements and could meet uh the CRA requirements and could meet uh the CRA requirements and could be good guidance for all open source be good guidance for all open source be good guidance for all open source projects and manufacturers um to comply projects and manufacturers um to comply projects and manufacturers um to comply with this requirements. So the timeline with this requirements. So the timeline with this requirements. So the timeline is uh to have an RC1 by the end of is uh to have an RC1 by the end of is uh to have an RC1 by the end of April. Uh so please join the discussions April. Uh so please join the discussions April. Uh so please join the discussions and provide comments and feedbacks uh on and provide comments and feedbacks uh on and provide comments and feedbacks uh on the the current state of the the the the current state of the the the the current state of the the specification. specification. specification. Um why do we want to have DRC1 so so Um why do we want to have DRC1 so so Um why do we want to have DRC1 so so fast and or paper? The main goal is to fast and or paper? The main goal is to fast and or paper? The main goal is to be able to provide such document such a be able to provide such document such a be able to provide such document such a specification in these states to the the specification in these states to the the specification in these states to the the the regulators. um the the commission the regulators. um the the commission the regulators. um the the commission the European Commission has a mission to the European Commission has a mission to the European Commission has a mission to create um an attestation program and create um an attestation program and create um an attestation program and also al also some guidance for open also al also some guidance for open also al also some guidance for open source project to comply with the CRA source project to comply with the CRA source project to comply with the CRA and we hope that this specification um and we hope that this specification um and we hope that this specification um and other that we will be working on uh and other that we will be working on uh and other that we will be working on uh shortly after can serve as a basis for shortly after can serve as a basis for shortly after can serve as a basis for the foundation work for the commission the foundation work for the commission the foundation work for the commission work sorry in establishing those work sorry in establishing those work sorry in establishing those guidance and those attestation program guidance and those attestation program guidance and those attestation program um so that's for the European Commission um so that's for the European Commission um so that's for the European Commission side but at the same time for CRA side but at the same time for CRA side but at the same time for CRA compliance there harmonized standards compliance there harmonized standards compliance there harmonized standards that are requested by the European that are requested by the European that are requested by the European Commission to European standard Commission to European standard Commission to European standard organization like Sens and Etsy. Um and organization like Sens and Etsy. Um and organization like Sens and Etsy. Um and we also want to provide this we also want to provide this we also want to provide this specification as an input to those specification as an input to those specification as an input to those standard organization um as and to to standard organization um as and to to standard organization um as and to to make this input uh the the results of make this input uh the the results of make this input uh the the results of community work. So from all open source community work. So from all open source community work. So from all open source foundations that I we listed earlier uh foundations that I we listed earlier uh foundations that I we listed earlier uh and also some key manufacturers that and also some key manufacturers that and also some key manufacturers that participated to the the working group participated to the the working group participated to the the working group and so really want to put the emphasis and so really want to put the emphasis and so really want to put the emphasis on that that it's a result of the on that that it's a result of the on that that it's a result of the consensus within the open source consensus within the open source consensus within the open source communities and communities with an S um communities and communities with an S um communities and communities with an S um to toward this work and we want to to toward this work and we want to to toward this work and we want to replicate the same kind of process for replicate the same kind of process for replicate the same kind of process for all the specification all the all the specification all the all the specification all the requirements of the CRA u and of course requirements of the CRA u and of course requirements of the CRA u and of course um other regulation um when the time um other regulation um when the time um other regulation um when the time um when it will be um when it will be um when it will be required. So uh it was a very short required. So uh it was a very short required. So uh it was a very short presentation but now we have 10 minutes presentation but now we have 10 minutes presentation but now we have 10 minutes or more even for questions. So feel free or more even for questions. So feel free or more even for questions. So feel free to to to um uh to to ask them. I think you have um uh to to ask them. I think you have um uh to to ask them. I think you have to go to No, there is no microphone. You to go to No, there is no microphone. You to go to No, there is no microphone. You will run with the micro. Okay. We run will run with the micro. Okay. We run will run with the micro. Okay. We run with the microphone with the microphone with the microphone for questions. for questions. for questions. Hey there. Hey there. Hey there. Um I was just curious um do you feel Um I was just curious um do you feel Um I was just curious um do you feel that the European Commission is going to that the European Commission is going to that the European Commission is going to give a stamp of approval to this effort give a stamp of approval to this effort give a stamp of approval to this effort to sort of effectively say okay open to sort of effectively say okay open to sort of effectively say okay open source projects that comply with this source projects that comply with this source projects that comply with this standard would effectively comply with standard would effectively comply with standard would effectively comply with the CRA provisions do is that the plan the CRA provisions do is that the plan the CRA provisions do is that the plan at least that's my understanding right at least that's my understanding right at least that's my understanding right yeah so I understand the question um so yeah so I understand the question um so yeah so I understand the question um so first mi mart and I are a lawyer don't first mi mart and I are a lawyer don't first mi mart and I are a lawyer don't take any business decision on whatever take any business decision on whatever take any business decision on whatever we will say but as far as we understand we will say but as far as we understand we will say but as far as we understand uh the commission cannot uh declare uh the commission cannot uh declare uh the commission cannot uh declare anything other than the harmonized anything other than the harmonized anything other than the harmonized standards uh as a way to comply with the standards uh as a way to comply with the standards uh as a way to comply with the CR so eventually only case laws CR so eventually only case laws CR so eventually only case laws unfortunately will decide about that uh unfortunately will decide about that uh unfortunately will decide about that uh but they will issue guidance so they can but they will issue guidance so they can but they will issue guidance so they can say that this is a good way uh to work say that this is a good way uh to work say that this is a good way uh to work towards compliance I guess that will be towards compliance I guess that will be towards compliance I guess that will be some kind of wording like that they will some kind of wording like that they will some kind of wording like that they will Yeah, that's that's my ma feel free to chime in. Want to add ma feel free to chime in. Want to add ma feel free to chime in. Want to add something? Sure. I am shocked that you have all of this I am shocked that you have all of this I am shocked that you have all of this in two pages. in two pages. in two pages. I know your goal is that you want to I know your goal is that you want to I know your goal is that you want to keep this consumable, that it's keep this consumable, that it's keep this consumable, that it's understandable by even a an organization understandable by even a an organization understandable by even a an organization that does not already have a mature that does not already have a mature that does not already have a mature vulnerability disclosure and management vulnerability disclosure and management vulnerability disclosure and management process. process. process. Um, this might just be a project Um, this might just be a project Um, this might just be a project management kind of question, but but how management kind of question, but but how management kind of question, but but how are you trying to both keep are you trying to both keep are you trying to both keep it consumable and simple enough for it consumable and simple enough for it consumable and simple enough for everyone everyone everyone to understand, but also be comprehensive to understand, but also be comprehensive to understand, but also be comprehensive enough and prescriptive enough? You said enough and prescriptive enough? You said enough and prescriptive enough? You said that was your goal to meet the the CRA that was your goal to meet the the CRA that was your goal to meet the the CRA requirements. requirements. requirements. Um, I'm just curious how how it seems Um, I'm just curious how how it seems Um, I'm just curious how how it seems like a a two very conflicting goals. So, like a a two very conflicting goals. So, like a a two very conflicting goals. So, what what's kind of your approach about what what's kind of your approach about what what's kind of your approach about keeping it both prescriptive and and keeping it both prescriptive and and keeping it both prescriptive and and short? Ma, you want to Yeah. Um, I was I short? Ma, you want to Yeah. Um, I was I short? Ma, you want to Yeah. Um, I was I was uh first uh we didn't tell you two was uh first uh we didn't tell you two was uh first uh we didn't tell you two pages in which font size. Uh but that's that's a joke apart. Um so Uh but that's that's a joke apart. Um so Uh but that's that's a joke apart. Um so uh we have been working with uh security uh we have been working with uh security uh we have been working with uh security policies uh and vulnerability reporting policies uh and vulnerability reporting policies uh and vulnerability reporting policies. It's called different ways in policies. It's called different ways in policies. It's called different ways in different uh opensource project. Uh so different uh opensource project. Uh so different uh opensource project. Uh so we have been working with that uh with we have been working with that uh with we have been working with that uh with that for years and we know what the that for years and we know what the that for years and we know what the typical uh use cases are and they are typical uh use cases are and they are typical uh use cases are and they are not that not that not that hard to extract and to write down what's hard to extract and to write down what's hard to extract and to write down what's the what's the critical part. The the what's the critical part. The the what's the critical part. The advantage that we have is for all the advantage that we have is for all the advantage that we have is for all the detailed proposals or or procedures we detailed proposals or or procedures we detailed proposals or or procedures we can link to guidelines outside So we do not for example say uh what So we do not for example say uh what So we do not for example say uh what kind of a back tracker you should kind of a back tracker you should kind of a back tracker you should use. We say that you should have a use. We say that you should have a use. We say that you should have a reporting reporting reporting um method. It may be a box tracker. It um method. It may be a box tracker. It um method. It may be a box tracker. It may be a mailing list. And then for may be a mailing list. And then for may be a mailing list. And then for people who want to know what are the people who want to know what are the people who want to know what are the best practices to do it, there are many best practices to do it, there are many best practices to do it, there are many guidelines available when they uh when guidelines available when they uh when guidelines available when they uh when they have a look if there's something they have a look if there's something they have a look if there's something they didn't know. And then I my personal they didn't know. And then I my personal they didn't know. And then I my personal opinion is that the CRA in my reading of opinion is that the CRA in my reading of opinion is that the CRA in my reading of the CRA that's it stays pretty generic. the CRA that's it stays pretty generic. the CRA that's it stays pretty generic. Uh so it doesn't have in most cases it Uh so it doesn't have in most cases it Uh so it doesn't have in most cases it don't doesn't have very specific and don't doesn't have very specific and don't doesn't have very specific and detailed requirements. It has more detailed requirements. It has more detailed requirements. It has more generic requirements and for a big part generic requirements and for a big part generic requirements and for a big part of that the open source community has of that the open source community has of that the open source community has already worked on answers and has already worked on answers and has already worked on answers and has them. Um so we are just referencing the them. Um so we are just referencing the them. Um so we are just referencing the the typical policies that are there. uh the typical policies that are there. uh the typical policies that are there. uh we have uh me we already have many we have uh me we already have many we have uh me we already have many comments pending and people discussing comments pending and people discussing comments pending and people discussing different things. So we will see uh what different things. So we will see uh what different things. So we will see uh what will be the final uh final size when uh will be the final uh final size when uh will be the final uh final size when uh when we take into account uh comments when we take into account uh comments when we take into account uh comments from different use cases. We'll see. Uh from different use cases. We'll see. Uh from different use cases. We'll see. Uh I'm really curious. There's also a question from Liliana on There's also a question from Liliana on There's also a question from Liliana on the Discord. Uh can anyone provide the Discord. Uh can anyone provide the Discord. Uh can anyone provide comments and feedback even if not part comments and feedback even if not part comments and feedback even if not part of the open source implementers of the open source implementers of the open source implementers community? community? community? Absolutely. Yeah. Yeah. It's a open source way of Yeah. Yeah. It's a open source way of Yeah. Yeah. It's a open source way of collaborating. So the the GitHub is open collaborating. So the the GitHub is open collaborating. So the the GitHub is open to anybody to open an issue, open a PR. to anybody to open an issue, open a PR. to anybody to open an issue, open a PR. Um eventually uh the the release of the Um eventually uh the the release of the Um eventually uh the the release of the 1.0 or the the risk candidate uh will be 1.0 or the the risk candidate uh will be 1.0 or the the risk candidate uh will be vetted by the member of the working vetted by the member of the working vetted by the member of the working group, but all contributions are group, but all contributions are group, but all contributions are welcome. welcome. welcome. Well, thanks. Well, thanks. Well, thanks. Is there any kind of specific feedback Is there any kind of specific feedback Is there any kind of specific feedback that you're you're looking for? Any that you're you're looking for? Any that you're you're looking for? Any specific areas that you would like specific areas that you would like specific areas that you would like contributions or just a general review? contributions or just a general review? contributions or just a general review? Could be both. Uh definitely we we are Could be both. Uh definitely we we are Could be both. Uh definitely we we are um so the draft uh the the current state um so the draft uh the the current state um so the draft uh the the current state uh it was really to get the ball uh it was really to get the ball uh it was really to get the ball rolling. um that there is nothing rolling. um that there is nothing rolling. um that there is nothing um nothing harder to get people to um nothing harder to get people to um nothing harder to get people to collaborate on a white uh page. So we collaborate on a white uh page. So we collaborate on a white uh page. So we wanted to have something first to start wanted to have something first to start wanted to have something first to start the discussion to initiate the the discussion to initiate the the discussion to initiate the discussions. Uh so it can be full review discussions. Uh so it can be full review discussions. Uh so it can be full review or or just some nitpicks uh on some or or just some nitpicks uh on some or or just some nitpicks uh on some wording and we already have have a wording and we already have have a wording and we already have have a couple and we also had just had the full couple and we also had just had the full couple and we also had just had the full review with lots of comments about cross review with lots of comments about cross review with lots of comments about cross references and stuff like that. So any references and stuff like that. So any references and stuff like that. So any feedback is welcome. Another quick one feedback is welcome. Another quick one feedback is welcome. Another quick one for me. Um is there any do you have any for me. Um is there any do you have any for me. Um is there any do you have any sort of plan to also provide some tools sort of plan to also provide some tools sort of plan to also provide some tools to open source projects to sort of allow to open source projects to sort of allow to open source projects to sort of allow them to either keep track of whether them to either keep track of whether them to either keep track of whether they fulfill this criteria or to they fulfill this criteria or to they fulfill this criteria or to automate some of that testing like for automate some of that testing like for automate some of that testing like for example the all vulnerabilities must be example the all vulnerabilities must be example the all vulnerabilities must be resolved that's the kind of thing that resolved that's the kind of thing that resolved that's the kind of thing that could be fairly easy automatable or do could be fairly easy automatable or do could be fairly easy automatable or do you want to map this to some of the you want to map this to some of the you want to map this to some of the other efforts like I think the scorecard other efforts like I think the scorecard other efforts like I think the scorecard project from open has something along project from open has something along project from open has something along those lines as well So, so the the goal those lines as well So, so the the goal those lines as well So, so the the goal of the OC work group is really to write of the OC work group is really to write of the OC work group is really to write the specifications. Um the the tools is the specifications. Um the the tools is the specifications. Um the the tools is a bit outside of the scope at least for a bit outside of the scope at least for a bit outside of the scope at least for now. Uh we more rely on other now. Uh we more rely on other now. Uh we more rely on other organization to to do that. Um there are organization to to do that. Um there are organization to to do that. Um there are efforts in parallel um um with various efforts in parallel um um with various efforts in parallel um um with various entities in Europe to to to uh create entities in Europe to to to uh create entities in Europe to to to uh create some tools to ease or to lower the cost some tools to ease or to lower the cost some tools to ease or to lower the cost for uh compliance with the CRA for uh compliance with the CRA for uh compliance with the CRA specifically targeted at small and specifically targeted at small and specifically targeted at small and medium enterprises. And this kind of uh medium enterprises. And this kind of uh medium enterprises. And this kind of uh tooling about whether they they fix the tooling about whether they they fix the tooling about whether they they fix the vulnerabilities and the tracking and vulnerabilities and the tracking and vulnerabilities and the tracking and what everything you can think about um what everything you can think about um what everything you can think about um uh is in the work and we are uh is in the work and we are uh is in the work and we are collaborating with some of them. We are collaborating with some of them. We are collaborating with some of them. We are participating to the the consortiums to participating to the the consortiums to participating to the the consortiums to provide those specification as input so provide those specification as input so provide those specification as input so that the the tool maker can work based that the the tool maker can work based that the the tool maker can work based on this. Thank you everyone for your on this. Thank you everyone for your on this. Thank you everyone for your attention and thank you Martin. Thank attention and thank you Martin.
