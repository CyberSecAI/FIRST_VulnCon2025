Kind: captions Language: en Hi everybody. Glad to be here with you. Hi everybody. Glad to be here with you. Hi everybody. Glad to be here with you. Uh I am the C.WE technical lead and the Uh I am the C.WE technical lead and the Uh I am the C.WE technical lead and the CWE uh co-founder from way back in 2005. CWE uh co-founder from way back in 2005. CWE uh co-founder from way back in 2005. I'm Steve Christie Kohley with the MITER I'm Steve Christie Kohley with the MITER I'm Steve Christie Kohley with the MITER Corporation. And today I want to talk Corporation. And today I want to talk Corporation. And today I want to talk about some hard problems in about some hard problems in about some hard problems in C.WE. First I'm going to go through some C.WE. First I'm going to go through some C.WE. First I'm going to go through some historical context. I'm going to talk a historical context. I'm going to talk a historical context. I'm going to talk a little bit about C.WE's organization and little bit about C.WE's organization and little bit about C.WE's organization and its representation. I want to talk about its representation. I want to talk about its representation. I want to talk about uh CWE mapping. We talk about that a uh CWE mapping. We talk about that a uh CWE mapping. We talk about that a lot, I know. Um and then I want to talk lot, I know. Um and then I want to talk lot, I know. Um and then I want to talk a little bit about uh how we're trying a little bit about uh how we're trying a little bit about uh how we're trying to modernize and improve CWE's coverage to modernize and improve CWE's coverage to modernize and improve CWE's coverage uh to handle current weaknesses and uh to handle current weaknesses and uh to handle current weaknesses and current current current issues. So, first of all, C.WE is now issues. So, first of all, C.WE is now issues. So, first of all, C.WE is now almost 20 years old. Um the first CWE almost 20 years old. Um the first CWE almost 20 years old. Um the first CWE proposal paper came out in late 2005, I proposal paper came out in late 2005, I proposal paper came out in late 2005, I think it was. uh it's mostly escaped the think it was. uh it's mostly escaped the think it was. uh it's mostly escaped the tumultuous uh upbringing um that CVE tumultuous uh upbringing um that CVE tumultuous uh upbringing um that CVE went through. Um at this point in CWE went through. Um at this point in CWE went through. Um at this point in CWE it's much it's more widely used than it's much it's more widely used than it's much it's more widely used than ever. It's still coming into its own I ever. It's still coming into its own I ever. It's still coming into its own I think um and it still does face some think um and it still does face some think um and it still does face some hard problems. My hope as CWE technical hard problems. My hope as CWE technical hard problems. My hope as CWE technical lead is to be able to lead CWE content lead is to be able to lead CWE content lead is to be able to lead CWE content development in a way that balances development in a way that balances development in a way that balances usability with technical usability with technical usability with technical excellence. excellence. excellence. Our audience has evolved over the years Our audience has evolved over the years Our audience has evolved over the years as well or at least what we intended as as well or at least what we intended as as well or at least what we intended as our primary audience. In the early years our primary audience. In the early years our primary audience. In the early years um we were trying to help people um we were trying to help people um we were trying to help people understand the capabilities of code understand the capabilities of code understand the capabilities of code analysis tools. So we were taking a lot analysis tools. So we were taking a lot analysis tools. So we were taking a lot of input and collaborating with a lot of of input and collaborating with a lot of of input and collaborating with a lot of code analysis vendors. We also were code analysis vendors. We also were code analysis vendors. We also were taking in input or trying to capture taking in input or trying to capture taking in input or trying to capture things that were being found by advanced things that were being found by advanced things that were being found by advanced bug hunters or consultants. And we also bug hunters or consultants. And we also bug hunters or consultants. And we also dealt with a lot of work from academic dealt with a lot of work from academic dealt with a lot of work from academic and industry and industry and industry researchers. Around 2010 or something researchers. Around 2010 or something researchers. Around 2010 or something like that, we started adding on like that, we started adding on like that, we started adding on developers and uh product security team developers and uh product security team developers and uh product security team leads. And just about four years ago, 5 leads. And just about four years ago, 5 leads. And just about four years ago, 5 years ago, something like that, our years ago, something like that, our years ago, something like that, our focus has shifted a little bit more to focus has shifted a little bit more to focus has shifted a little bit more to be much more friendly towards people who be much more friendly towards people who be much more friendly towards people who are doing vulnerability management, are doing vulnerability management, are doing vulnerability management, vulnerability management staff, vulner vulnerability management staff, vulner vulnerability management staff, vulner vulnerability management leads and so vulnerability management leads and so vulnerability management leads and so on. that is the people who are on. that is the people who are on. that is the people who are publishing CVEes on a day-to-day basis. publishing CVEes on a day-to-day basis. publishing CVEes on a day-to-day basis. One of the big differences here with One of the big differences here with One of the big differences here with this audience is that it's evolved from this audience is that it's evolved from this audience is that it's evolved from a really highly technical, highly a really highly technical, highly a really highly technical, highly specialized audience in the early days specialized audience in the early days specialized audience in the early days of CWE getting into people who are more of CWE getting into people who are more of CWE getting into people who are more or less novice CWE users who aren't or less novice CWE users who aren't or less novice CWE users who aren't necessarily deeply uh experienced uh in development. development. development. Our content development has also evolved Our content development has also evolved Our content development has also evolved and shifted over the years as well. In and shifted over the years as well. In and shifted over the years as well. In the very beginning, we took uh what I the very beginning, we took uh what I the very beginning, we took uh what I have referred to always as a kitchen have referred to always as a kitchen have referred to always as a kitchen sync approach. We got a lot of inputs sync approach. We got a lot of inputs sync approach. We got a lot of inputs and suggestions from code analysis tool and suggestions from code analysis tool and suggestions from code analysis tool vendors. We looked at a number of vendors. We looked at a number of vendors. We looked at a number of different software security guides whose different software security guides whose different software security guides whose authors allowed us to use their content. authors allowed us to use their content. authors allowed us to use their content. Uh, and then me who was the CVE editor Uh, and then me who was the CVE editor Uh, and then me who was the CVE editor at the time, I was just bagging and at the time, I was just bagging and at the time, I was just bagging and tagging all sorts of unusual CVEes that tagging all sorts of unusual CVEes that tagging all sorts of unusual CVEes that seemed like it might be interesting. Um seemed like it might be interesting. Um seemed like it might be interesting. Um at that time we had a single main view a at that time we had a single main view a at that time we had a single main view a single main organizational scheme and we single main organizational scheme and we single main organizational scheme and we really did have an assumption of a really did have an assumption of a really did have an assumption of a technical expert technical expert technical expert audience that evolved uh in terms of the audience that evolved uh in terms of the audience that evolved uh in terms of the content development so that around 2010 content development so that around 2010 content development so that around 2010 maybe a little bit earlier we had maybe a little bit earlier we had maybe a little bit earlier we had started supporting multiple views started supporting multiple views started supporting multiple views multiple levels of abstraction if you're multiple levels of abstraction if you're multiple levels of abstraction if you're familiar with CWE this is where the familiar with CWE this is where the familiar with CWE this is where the abstractions of pillars classes bases abstractions of pillars classes bases abstractions of pillars classes bases and variants came into play Uh we also and variants came into play Uh we also and variants came into play Uh we also developed a vulnerability theory developed a vulnerability theory developed a vulnerability theory framework which is a conceptual framework which is a conceptual framework which is a conceptual framework for understanding weaknesses framework for understanding weaknesses framework for understanding weaknesses in in light of how they appear in in in light of how they appear in in in light of how they appear in vulnerabilities and created a bit of vulnerabilities and created a bit of vulnerabilities and created a bit of terminology uh supporting that terminology uh supporting that terminology uh supporting that vulnerability theory. And that vulnerability theory. And that vulnerability theory. And that influenced a lot of our development, our influenced a lot of our development, our influenced a lot of our development, our content development at the time, content development at the time, content development at the time, especially as we were doing uh especially as we were doing uh especially as we were doing uh hierarchical hierarchical hierarchical organization and we were doing a lot of organization and we were doing a lot of organization and we were doing a lot of systematic reorganization including the systematic reorganization including the systematic reorganization including the highest level most general CWEs which we highest level most general CWEs which we highest level most general CWEs which we call pillars. We also had as I mentioned call pillars. We also had as I mentioned call pillars. We also had as I mentioned before the increasing developer focus before the increasing developer focus before the increasing developer focus which changed the kind of content that which changed the kind of content that which changed the kind of content that we developed as well. We needed our we developed as well. We needed our we developed as well. We needed our content to be a little bit more clean, a content to be a little bit more clean, a content to be a little bit more clean, a little bit more comprehensive and a little bit more comprehensive and a little bit more comprehensive and a little bit more understandable to little bit more understandable to little bit more understandable to developers themselves who needed to developers themselves who needed to developers themselves who needed to understand what are these weaknesses, understand what are these weaknesses, understand what are these weaknesses, how bad are they, what do I need to do how bad are they, what do I need to do how bad are they, what do I need to do to fix them. And then go to around 2019 to fix them. And then go to around 2019 to fix them. And then go to around 2019 2020 um we started really broadening 2020 um we started really broadening 2020 um we started really broadening CWE's applicable to a broader variety of CWE's applicable to a broader variety of CWE's applicable to a broader variety of technologies and domains. Uh this technologies and domains. Uh this technologies and domains. Uh this started out with hardware in CW 4.0 0 started out with hardware in CW 4.0 0 started out with hardware in CW 4.0 0 which we released in 2020. Uh we moved which we released in 2020. Uh we moved which we released in 2020. Uh we moved into ICS into ICS into ICS uh last year or so. AI has been all the uh last year or so. AI has been all the uh last year or so. AI has been all the new hotness. Uh and there have been some new hotness. Uh and there have been some new hotness. Uh and there have been some other technologies and domains uh that other technologies and domains uh that other technologies and domains uh that we've been expanding into. And these we've been expanding into. And these we've been expanding into. And these years we've been taking on a lot of years we've been taking on a lot of years we've been taking on a lot of really significant community really significant community really significant community contributions including fully baked new contributions including fully baked new contributions including fully baked new CWE entries. Now that's not new in some CWE entries. Now that's not new in some CWE entries. Now that's not new in some senses because we had a lot of senses because we had a lot of senses because we had a lot of contributions even in the very early contributions even in the very early contributions even in the very early days but it's more public um there's days but it's more public um there's days but it's more public um there's more public trackability there's just more public trackability there's just more public trackability there's just more direct public involvement more direct public involvement more direct public involvement um at around this time as well I um at around this time as well I um at around this time as well I realized as CWE technical lead that uh realized as CWE technical lead that uh realized as CWE technical lead that uh we really needed to start imposing some we really needed to start imposing some we really needed to start imposing some additional quality expectations. additional quality expectations. additional quality expectations. uh the authoring of CWE content was uh the authoring of CWE content was uh the authoring of CWE content was becoming less centralized with MITER as becoming less centralized with MITER as becoming less centralized with MITER as a central uh authoring authority uh and a central uh authoring authority uh and a central uh authoring authority uh and we were also you know shifting our our we were also you know shifting our our we were also you know shifting our our people on our team and so on. So uh people on our team and so on. So uh people on our team and so on. So uh there was an increase in quality there was an increase in quality there was an increase in quality expectations in an attempt on my part to expectations in an attempt on my part to expectations in an attempt on my part to try and formalize what some of those try and formalize what some of those try and formalize what some of those are. At the same time, we've brought on are. At the same time, we've brought on are. At the same time, we've brought on these newer users as our one of our these newer users as our one of our these newer users as our one of our primary use cases who are not primary use cases who are not primary use cases who are not necessarily day-to-day developers and necessarily day-to-day developers and necessarily day-to-day developers and thus trying to make content changes that thus trying to make content changes that thus trying to make content changes that really help with the usability and really help with the usability and really help with the usability and understandability of understandability of understandability of C.WE. C.WE. C.WE. Our influences have evolved over time as Our influences have evolved over time as Our influences have evolved over time as well, moving from application security well, moving from application security well, moving from application security vulnerability reports and you know vulnerability reports and you know vulnerability reports and you know analysis tools, academic research and so analysis tools, academic research and so analysis tools, academic research and so on into trying to get a better handle on on into trying to get a better handle on on into trying to get a better handle on what are the different use cases, who what are the different use cases, who what are the different use cases, who are the personas who are using C.WE's are the personas who are using C.WE's are the personas who are using C.WE's recognizing what their various needs and recognizing what their various needs and recognizing what their various needs and backgrounds are. And we've had a lot of backgrounds are. And we've had a lot of backgrounds are. And we've had a lot of active um community interest. We have a active um community interest. We have a active um community interest. We have a lot of active working groups and uh lot of active working groups and uh lot of active working groups and uh special interest groups and so on. We've special interest groups and so on. We've special interest groups and so on. We've done uh various kinds of efforts to done uh various kinds of efforts to done uh various kinds of efforts to systematically reclassify or reorganize systematically reclassify or reorganize systematically reclassify or reorganize C.WE in some ways that might not be C.WE in some ways that might not be C.WE in some ways that might not be noticeable to a lot of people. Uh and noticeable to a lot of people. Uh and noticeable to a lot of people. Uh and and we're doing all of this in light of and we're doing all of this in light of and we're doing all of this in light of an increasing variety of weaknesses that an increasing variety of weaknesses that an increasing variety of weaknesses that are getting increasingly reported that are getting increasingly reported that are getting increasingly reported that are not part of the top 25. They're not are not part of the top 25. They're not are not part of the top 25. They're not your same old same old hard-coded your same old same old hard-coded your same old same old hard-coded password SQL injection buffer overflow password SQL injection buffer overflow password SQL injection buffer overflow kind of thing. And so I want to get into CW And so I want to get into CW And so I want to get into CW organization and presentate uh organization and presentate uh organization and presentate uh representation. Um there are a lot of uh representation. Um there are a lot of uh representation. Um there are a lot of uh bits of information out there about what bits of information out there about what bits of information out there about what constitutes a good taxonomy or constitutes a good taxonomy or constitutes a good taxonomy or classification system and there isn't classification system and there isn't classification system and there isn't any one single um list of criteria that any one single um list of criteria that any one single um list of criteria that I could easily find. But some of the I could easily find. But some of the I could easily find. But some of the main criteria is mutual exclusivity. main criteria is mutual exclusivity. main criteria is mutual exclusivity. That is every single grouping every That is every single grouping every That is every single grouping every single weakness is clearly distinct from single weakness is clearly distinct from single weakness is clearly distinct from others. We want to avoid or entirely others. We want to avoid or entirely others. We want to avoid or entirely avoid overlap um if possible. We want to avoid overlap um if possible. We want to avoid overlap um if possible. We want to make make sure that every CWE is make make sure that every CWE is make make sure that every CWE is presented unambiguously and yet sim presented unambiguously and yet sim presented unambiguously and yet sim simultaneously we need to make sure that simultaneously we need to make sure that simultaneously we need to make sure that they're understandable and usable to our they're understandable and usable to our they're understandable and usable to our general public. And of course general public. And of course general public. And of course completeness for any kind of knowledge completeness for any kind of knowledge completeness for any kind of knowledge base for any kind of repository base for any kind of repository base for any kind of repository completeness is a big is a big uh completeness is a big is a big uh completeness is a big is a big uh important criterion. And what I think of important criterion. And what I think of important criterion. And what I think of when I think about completeness when I think about completeness when I think about completeness especially for CWE is that we have especially for CWE is that we have especially for CWE is that we have sufficient breadth and that we have sufficient breadth and that we have sufficient breadth and that we have sufficient depth. Um and then there are sufficient depth. Um and then there are sufficient depth. Um and then there are other considerations for completeness. other considerations for completeness. other considerations for completeness. We also really want repeatability. We We also really want repeatability. We We also really want repeatability. We want people different people who use want people different people who use want people different people who use C.WE for the same task to come up with C.WE for the same task to come up with C.WE for the same task to come up with the same results. And I'll cover some of the same results. And I'll cover some of the same results. And I'll cover some of that goal in the uh in the upcoming that goal in the uh in the upcoming that goal in the uh in the upcoming slides. And we also want it to be as slides. And we also want it to be as slides. And we also want it to be as extensible as possible. And we've done a extensible as possible. And we've done a extensible as possible. And we've done a number of things in that area um number of things in that area um number of things in that area um including the broader theoretical including the broader theoretical including the broader theoretical framework which helps people to use framework which helps people to use framework which helps people to use maybe certain CWEs or certain parts of maybe certain CWEs or certain parts of maybe certain CWEs or certain parts of the C.WE tree that are generally not the C.WE tree that are generally not the C.WE tree that are generally not seen or encountered very often uh in the seen or encountered very often uh in the seen or encountered very often uh in the real world or at least in the public CVE world. So um I'm going to cover just a world. So um I'm going to cover just a world. So um I'm going to cover just a little bit um how CWE is structured at little bit um how CWE is structured at little bit um how CWE is structured at this point. First of all, CWE IDs are this point. First of all, CWE IDs are this point. First of all, CWE IDs are really a flat ID numeric space. There's really a flat ID numeric space. There's really a flat ID numeric space. There's no relationship between CWE ID numbers no relationship between CWE ID numbers no relationship between CWE ID numbers and um any kind of underlying structure, and um any kind of underlying structure, and um any kind of underlying structure, but we do capture a lot of structure but we do capture a lot of structure but we do capture a lot of structure including in a number of different including in a number of different including in a number of different hierarchical views. The main tree as hierarchical views. The main tree as hierarchical views. The main tree as part of the research view, view 1000, is part of the research view, view 1000, is part of the research view, view 1000, is structured uh hierarchically. I think structured uh hierarchically. I think structured uh hierarchically. I think some of its deepest uh levels goes about some of its deepest uh levels goes about some of its deepest uh levels goes about six levels deep or something like that. six levels deep or something like that. six levels deep or something like that. Um we have the highest level the pillars Um we have the highest level the pillars Um we have the highest level the pillars then high level classes and then bases then high level classes and then bases then high level classes and then bases and then varants. Um those cover uh and then varants. Um those cover uh and then varants. Um those cover uh those can be spread around through the those can be spread around through the those can be spread around through the tree and and there can be depths of six tree and and there can be depths of six tree and and there can be depths of six or more in some parts in some of the or more in some parts in some of the or more in some parts in some of the bushy or deeper parts of the tree. Um bushy or deeper parts of the tree. Um bushy or deeper parts of the tree. Um but these CWEs are also characterized in but these CWEs are also characterized in but these CWEs are also characterized in terms of number of a number of different terms of number of a number of different terms of number of a number of different dimensions or facets. Things like what dimensions or facets. Things like what dimensions or facets. Things like what is the behavior? what are the properties is the behavior? what are the properties is the behavior? what are the properties of the behavior or the properties of the of the behavior or the properties of the of the behavior or the properties of the resources that are being manipulated? Uh resources that are being manipulated? Uh resources that are being manipulated? Uh and sometimes at lower levels we get and sometimes at lower levels we get and sometimes at lower levels we get into language specific or technology into language specific or technology into language specific or technology specific kinds of considerations. specific kinds of considerations. specific kinds of considerations. um if we were to expand out all of the um if we were to expand out all of the um if we were to expand out all of the you know possible variations of every you know possible variations of every you know possible variations of every single property of every single single property of every single single property of every single dimension at every single level um dimension at every single level um dimension at every single level um assuming four layers because we have assuming four layers because we have assuming four layers because we have four different named abstraction layers four different named abstraction layers four different named abstraction layers we could wind up with over 32,000 we could wind up with over 32,000 we could wind up with over 32,000 different CWEs assuming let's say eight different CWEs assuming let's say eight different CWEs assuming let's say eight children per layer right now CWES is at children per layer right now CWES is at children per layer right now CWES is at 900 plus weaknesses right so that would 900 plus weaknesses right so that would 900 plus weaknesses right so that would be a a huge increase and one of the be a a huge increase and one of the be a a huge increase and one of the questions that we have to ask ourselves questions that we have to ask ourselves questions that we have to ask ourselves is who does it serve to have such a huge is who does it serve to have such a huge is who does it serve to have such a huge increase um in an environment where increase um in an environment where increase um in an environment where there are other people that are like there are other people that are like there are other people that are like there are already too many CWEs even amongst all this we do have CWEs even amongst all this we do have CWEs even amongst all this we do have some classification gaps and one major some classification gaps and one major some classification gaps and one major point I'd like to make is that a lot of point I'd like to make is that a lot of point I'd like to make is that a lot of CWE just has not been really widely CWE just has not been really widely CWE just has not been really widely researched or extensively researched researched or extensively researched researched or extensively researched from the perspective of classification from the perspective of classification from the perspective of classification or taxonomies or taxonomies or taxonomies Buffer overflows are a good counter Buffer overflows are a good counter Buffer overflows are a good counter example. They've been around, you know, example. They've been around, you know, example. They've been around, you know, for decades upon decades. They've been for decades upon decades. They've been for decades upon decades. They've been studied and classified for decades. studied and classified for decades. studied and classified for decades. Maybe injection is somewhere in that Maybe injection is somewhere in that Maybe injection is somewhere in that area as well. But there's entire other area as well. But there's entire other area as well. But there's entire other swaths of C.WE that do not have really swaths of C.WE that do not have really swaths of C.WE that do not have really formalized classification studies. And formalized classification studies. And formalized classification studies. And one example of that is access control. one example of that is access control. one example of that is access control. And one of the things that we have to And one of the things that we have to And one of the things that we have to deal with in C.WE we is there are you deal with in C.WE we is there are you deal with in C.WE we is there are you know hundreds of different kinds of know hundreds of different kinds of know hundreds of different kinds of access control models um and yet we're access control models um and yet we're access control models um and yet we're also operating in a space where we need also operating in a space where we need also operating in a space where we need to be supporting users who don't even to be supporting users who don't even to be supporting users who don't even understand the difference between understand the difference between understand the difference between authorization and authorization and authorization and authentication and in a lot of these authentication and in a lot of these authentication and in a lot of these areas where there are gaps of industry areas where there are gaps of industry areas where there are gaps of industry knowledge really or at least systematic knowledge really or at least systematic knowledge really or at least systematic industry knowledge there isn't a lot of industry knowledge there isn't a lot of industry knowledge there isn't a lot of really wellestablished terminology or really wellestablished terminology or really wellestablished terminology or comprehensive sets of examples so if comprehensive sets of examples so if comprehensive sets of examples so if you're navigating CWE trying to figure you're navigating CWE trying to figure you're navigating CWE trying to figure out um a mapping for an for a weakness out um a mapping for an for a weakness out um a mapping for an for a weakness that's relatively obscure. You might not that's relatively obscure. You might not that's relatively obscure. You might not necessarily have an established ter term necessarily have an established ter term necessarily have an established ter term to just go and look up. We don't have to just go and look up. We don't have to just go and look up. We don't have established terminology terminology like established terminology terminology like established terminology terminology like SQL injection um in many parts of SQL injection um in many parts of SQL injection um in many parts of CWE to help close those gaps or better CWE to help close those gaps or better CWE to help close those gaps or better characterize those gaps. One of the characterize those gaps. One of the characterize those gaps. One of the things that we're starting to look into things that we're starting to look into things that we're starting to look into more seriously is really doing some more seriously is really doing some more seriously is really doing some reorganization and creating intermediary reorganization and creating intermediary reorganization and creating intermediary entries that could help better organize entries that could help better organize entries that could help better organize important kinds of classes or bases important kinds of classes or bases important kinds of classes or bases especially in the area where there are especially in the area where there are especially in the area where there are relatively unusual weaknesses that not relatively unusual weaknesses that not relatively unusual weaknesses that not every single person is familiar with every single person is familiar with every single person is familiar with like SQL injection. As a result of that like SQL injection. As a result of that like SQL injection. As a result of that work though, we might have to invent new work though, we might have to invent new work though, we might have to invent new terms yet again. we did it before that terms yet again. we did it before that terms yet again. we did it before that didn't have a great usability impact didn't have a great usability impact didn't have a great usability impact especially on new users but if there's especially on new users but if there's especially on new users but if there's no words that exist for what you're no words that exist for what you're no words that exist for what you're describing um you know we we have to do describing um you know we we have to do describing um you know we we have to do something about that um but as we go and something about that um but as we go and something about that um but as we go and make these changes to sort of the middle make these changes to sort of the middle make these changes to sort of the middle part of the tree um we need to make sure part of the tree um we need to make sure part of the tree um we need to make sure that any new changes we introduce that that any new changes we introduce that that any new changes we introduce that that we aren't introducing overlap or that we aren't introducing overlap or that we aren't introducing overlap or potentially causing confusion along the potentially causing confusion along the potentially causing confusion along the way and we need to be sure that these way and we need to be sure that these way and we need to be sure that these intermediate entries are generalized intermediate entries are generalized intermediate entries are generalized well enough and appropriately well enough and appropriately well enough and appropriately appropriately enough so that they can appropriately enough so that they can appropriately enough so that they can still be understandable and so that still be understandable and so that still be understandable and so that people can still be pretty clear that people can still be pretty clear that people can still be pretty clear that when they're doing certain mappings that when they're doing certain mappings that when they're doing certain mappings that they can have confidence that their they can have confidence that their they can have confidence that their mapping is appropriately accurate. Uh I've touched I've touched a bit Uh I've touched I've touched a bit Uh I've touched I've touched a bit already on the uh comprehensiveness of already on the uh comprehensiveness of already on the uh comprehensiveness of the corpus, but one thing I would like the corpus, but one thing I would like the corpus, but one thing I would like to note is that when we did have that to note is that when we did have that to note is that when we did have that kitchen sink approach, we had a lot of kitchen sink approach, we had a lot of kitchen sink approach, we had a lot of low-level variants and maybe even low-level variants and maybe even low-level variants and maybe even subvariants in the early days. Um in subvariants in the early days. Um in subvariants in the early days. Um in general, I've been reluctant to create general, I've been reluctant to create general, I've been reluctant to create additional new low-level variants. We additional new low-level variants. We additional new low-level variants. We have a lot of leaves in the tree, but have a lot of leaves in the tree, but have a lot of leaves in the tree, but it's not a it's not a very very bushy at it's not a it's not a very very bushy at it's not a it's not a very very bushy at the bottom of the tree. I would like to the bottom of the tree. I would like to the bottom of the tree. I would like to really uh understand and better get really uh understand and better get really uh understand and better get better control over a more systematic better control over a more systematic better control over a more systematic approach to construct uh construction of approach to construct uh construction of approach to construct uh construction of the entire hierarchy. And we do have the entire hierarchy. And we do have the entire hierarchy. And we do have some parts of the tree that are very some parts of the tree that are very some parts of the tree that are very bushy and some parts that are very bushy and some parts that are very bushy and some parts that are very sparse. But in both cases, we may need sparse. But in both cases, we may need sparse. But in both cases, we may need original time consuming research uh in original time consuming research uh in original time consuming research uh in order to really solve the problem. You order to really solve the problem. You order to really solve the problem. You might be like, "Oh, if a part of a tree might be like, "Oh, if a part of a tree might be like, "Oh, if a part of a tree is bushy, then that's great, isn't it?" is bushy, then that's great, isn't it?" is bushy, then that's great, isn't it?" Yeah, but some CWE entries have, let's Yeah, but some CWE entries have, let's Yeah, but some CWE entries have, let's say, 20 children or more. It's a very say, 20 children or more. It's a very say, 20 children or more. It's a very clear indication that some kinds of clear indication that some kinds of clear indication that some kinds of intermediary nodes might need to be uh intermediary nodes might need to be uh intermediary nodes might need to be uh created, but it's not the kind of thing created, but it's not the kind of thing created, but it's not the kind of thing that you can just bang out a solution that you can just bang out a solution that you can just bang out a solution that will work in the course of an that will work in the course of an that will work in the course of an afternoon. I just want to uh note that there are I just want to uh note that there are I just want to uh note that there are other classification efforts out there. other classification efforts out there. other classification efforts out there. We know and are aware of that. Uh this We know and are aware of that. Uh this We know and are aware of that. Uh this will be included in the slides as I save them. Now I want to cover into mapping them. Now I want to cover into mapping them. Now I want to cover into mapping problems which on the CWE project we problems which on the CWE project we problems which on the CWE project we talk about a lot. Um, even people who talk about a lot. Um, even people who talk about a lot. Um, even people who know and are sincere about uh using CWE know and are sincere about uh using CWE know and are sincere about uh using CWE uh face problems when they're trying to uh face problems when they're trying to uh face problems when they're trying to do mappings, especially for more do mappings, especially for more do mappings, especially for more difficult, non-obvious kinds of difficult, non-obvious kinds of difficult, non-obvious kinds of issues. And we have a couple main goals issues. And we have a couple main goals issues. And we have a couple main goals here uh in the C.WE project for helping here uh in the C.WE project for helping here uh in the C.WE project for helping out with those problems. We want to out with those problems. We want to out with those problems. We want to really help CNAs and other people who really help CNAs and other people who really help CNAs and other people who are doing weakness mapping. We want to are doing weakness mapping. We want to are doing weakness mapping. We want to help them to find the most accurate and help them to find the most accurate and help them to find the most accurate and precise mappings that are available. Uh, precise mappings that are available. Uh, precise mappings that are available. Uh, and we also want to help them easily and we also want to help them easily and we also want to help them easily navigate the C.WE corpus. We've made navigate the C.WE corpus. We've made navigate the C.WE corpus. We've made some changes recently to try and reduce some changes recently to try and reduce some changes recently to try and reduce a little bit of the effect of the wall a little bit of the effect of the wall a little bit of the effect of the wall of text. Um, wall of text is very useful of text. Um, wall of text is very useful of text. Um, wall of text is very useful when you're looking at a C.WE entry if when you're looking at a C.WE entry if when you're looking at a C.WE entry if you need to learn everything about it, you need to learn everything about it, you need to learn everything about it, but many users don't. Um, we have but many users don't. Um, we have but many users don't. Um, we have certain realistic goals when it comes to certain realistic goals when it comes to certain realistic goals when it comes to to mapping. I think um C.WE we mapping to mapping. I think um C.WE we mapping to mapping. I think um C.WE we mapping is good if uh we have different people is good if uh we have different people is good if uh we have different people who take a vulnerability and map it to who take a vulnerability and map it to who take a vulnerability and map it to the same CWE or CWES assuming those the same CWE or CWES assuming those the same CWE or CWES assuming those people have the exact same background people have the exact same background people have the exact same background skills the same information that's skills the same information that's skills the same information that's available to them and the same and available to them and the same and available to them and the same and they're operating under the same time they're operating under the same time they're operating under the same time constraints. constraints. constraints.

Um and in other cases, we have C.WE entries that other cases, we have C.WE entries that other cases, we have C.WE entries that are pretty much prohibited, those that are pretty much prohibited, those that are pretty much prohibited, those that we've deprecated entirely. um CWE views we've deprecated entirely. um CWE views we've deprecated entirely. um CWE views and categories also have their own IDs. and categories also have their own IDs. and categories also have their own IDs. We're trying to minimize um the We're trying to minimize um the We're trying to minimize um the presentation of those IDs, but presentation of those IDs, but presentation of those IDs, but nonetheless, people might be tempted to nonetheless, people might be tempted to nonetheless, people might be tempted to use those. Um and there are some CWEs use those. Um and there are some CWEs use those. Um and there are some CWEs that are more or less discouraged that that are more or less discouraged that that are more or less discouraged that we're really tempted to prohibit.

Um but we also need the broader Um but we also need the broader Um but we also need the broader community to handle and manage them community to handle and manage them community to handle and manage them better. And I'll give two examples. One better. And I'll give two examples. One better. And I'll give two examples. One of them is CWE 200 that a lot of people of them is CWE 200 that a lot of people of them is CWE 200 that a lot of people treat of as just being equivalent to an treat of as just being equivalent to an treat of as just being equivalent to an information leak. And think of how many information leak. And think of how many information leak. And think of how many weaknesses potentially could lead to weaknesses potentially could lead to weaknesses potentially could lead to information leaks. Um, and nonetheless information leaks. Um, and nonetheless information leaks. Um, and nonetheless that CWE has a lot of better, narrower that CWE has a lot of better, narrower that CWE has a lot of better, narrower children that could be used instead of children that could be used instead of children that could be used instead of CW200 itself. We also have CWE for improper itself. We also have CWE for improper itself. We also have CWE for improper input validation. people's favorite CWE input validation. people's favorite CWE input validation. people's favorite CWE to hate on. It's certainly mine. Um, but to hate on. It's certainly mine. Um, but to hate on. It's certainly mine. Um, but we published better, narrower children we published better, narrower children we published better, narrower children almost five years ago. For example, almost five years ago. For example, almost five years ago. For example, there's a CW C.WE for not properly there's a CW C.WE for not properly there's a CW C.WE for not properly validating a quantity. There's a validating a quantity. There's a validating a quantity. There's a different one for not validating um that different one for not validating um that different one for not validating um that something has the expected syntax that's something has the expected syntax that's something has the expected syntax that's being provided to you. Um, and yet still being provided to you. Um, and yet still being provided to you. Um, and yet still in cases of, you know, time restrictions in cases of, you know, time restrictions in cases of, you know, time restrictions or you're just not exactly sure what to or you're just not exactly sure what to or you're just not exactly sure what to do and you want to move on, uh, a lot of do and you want to move on, uh, a lot of do and you want to move on, uh, a lot of people just move map to C.WE20 and then people just move map to C.WE20 and then people just move map to C.WE20 and then they're done with it. And, um, recently they're done with it. And, um, recently they're done with it. And, um, recently I heard a podcast with some software I heard a podcast with some software I heard a podcast with some software security experts talking specifically security experts talking specifically security experts talking specifically about this particular kind of problem. about this particular kind of problem. about this particular kind of problem. There's any number of, uh, pillars that There's any number of, uh, pillars that There's any number of, uh, pillars that probably would be good for us. Um, and probably would be good for us. Um, and probably would be good for us. Um, and then other kinds of C.WE WE's that are then other kinds of C.WE WE's that are then other kinds of C.WE WE's that are currently discouraged and maybe at some currently discouraged and maybe at some currently discouraged and maybe at some point we would be able to or we want to point we would be able to or we want to point we would be able to or we want to be able to get to the point of be able to get to the point of be able to get to the point of prohibiting but we need community input prohibiting but we need community input prohibiting but we need community input and we need community help in doing that. Okay, moving on. I've misplaced my that. Okay, moving on. I've misplaced my that. Okay, moving on. I've misplaced my slides. There we go. slides. There we go. slides. There we go. And so we do recognize that there are And so we do recognize that there are And so we do recognize that there are some real world limitations affecting some real world limitations affecting some real world limitations affecting mapping accuracy and precision. Um you mapping accuracy and precision. Um you mapping accuracy and precision. Um you know people have limited time or limited know people have limited time or limited know people have limited time or limited expertise to do expertise to do expertise to do mapping and there are often conflicting mapping and there are often conflicting mapping and there are often conflicting goals in say writing up a CVE goals in say writing up a CVE goals in say writing up a CVE vulnerability description or analyzing vulnerability description or analyzing vulnerability description or analyzing vulnerability. There might be be vulnerability. There might be be vulnerability. There might be be conflicting goals between doing that and conflicting goals between doing that and conflicting goals between doing that and really understanding and digging into really understanding and digging into really understanding and digging into what the underlying root cause weakness what the underlying root cause weakness what the underlying root cause weakness is. is. is. We've been advocating for a while now We've been advocating for a while now We've been advocating for a while now now that we do believe that CNAs now that we do believe that CNAs now that we do believe that CNAs especially developers really are best especially developers really are best especially developers really are best performed to uh they're really best performed to uh they're really best performed to uh they're really best positioned to perform the most accurate positioned to perform the most accurate positioned to perform the most accurate precise CWE mappings. They have access precise CWE mappings. They have access precise CWE mappings. They have access to the source code. They know the to the source code. They know the to the source code. They know the context in which their product is context in which their product is context in which their product is expected to operate so on and so forth. expected to operate so on and so forth. expected to operate so on and so forth. However, as developers, developers don't However, as developers, developers don't However, as developers, developers don't have a lot of time. Um but then we also have a lot of time. Um but then we also have a lot of time. Um but then we also have the simple fact that developers by have the simple fact that developers by have the simple fact that developers by nature of being developers aren't nature of being developers aren't nature of being developers aren't full-time weakness or vulnerability full-time weakness or vulnerability full-time weakness or vulnerability analysts. So we have a bit of a conflict analysts. So we have a bit of a conflict analysts. So we have a bit of a conflict here uh with this. Another important realization that this. Another important realization that this. Another important realization that I've had that I want to work on moving I've had that I want to work on moving I've had that I want to work on moving uh forward is educating people about the uh forward is educating people about the uh forward is educating people about the difference between the weakness mindset difference between the weakness mindset difference between the weakness mindset and the vulnerability mindset. If you're and the vulnerability mindset. If you're and the vulnerability mindset. If you're doing vulnerability thinking, you're doing vulnerability thinking, you're doing vulnerability thinking, you're often thinking about thinking about often thinking about thinking about often thinking about thinking about things like the attacks, um, things like the attacks, um, things like the attacks, um, mitigations, what are the different mitigations, what are the different mitigations, what are the different consequences, doing the risk assessment, consequences, doing the risk assessment, consequences, doing the risk assessment, products and product versions I guess products and product versions I guess products and product versions I guess are important to some people, you know, are important to some people, you know, are important to some people, you know, and maybe the weakness just happens to and maybe the weakness just happens to and maybe the weakness just happens to be mentioned. Um, but these all of these be mentioned. Um, but these all of these be mentioned. Um, but these all of these concepts while important for concepts while important for concepts while important for understanding for vulnerabilities are in understanding for vulnerabilities are in understanding for vulnerabilities are in some ways sort of tangential when it some ways sort of tangential when it some ways sort of tangential when it comes to weaknesses. So let's take comes to weaknesses. So let's take comes to weaknesses. So let's take impacts. um you know you have lots of impacts. um you know you have lots of impacts. um you know you have lots of vulnerabilities that could involve code vulnerabilities that could involve code vulnerabilities that could involve code execution, information leaks or execution, information leaks or execution, information leaks or privilege escalation. Um each of those privilege escalation. Um each of those privilege escalation. Um each of those separate technical impacts um could be separate technical impacts um could be separate technical impacts um could be the result of exploitation of dozens of the result of exploitation of dozens of the result of exploitation of dozens of different C.WE. And so there's no real different C.WE. And so there's no real different C.WE. And so there's no real onetoone relationship in that kind of onetoone relationship in that kind of onetoone relationship in that kind of thinking. Also a lot of vulnerabilities thinking. Also a lot of vulnerabilities thinking. Also a lot of vulnerabilities can be described pretty well in terms of can be described pretty well in terms of can be described pretty well in terms of the attack. Um you can if you can the attack. Um you can if you can the attack. Um you can if you can understand how the vulnerability can be understand how the vulnerability can be understand how the vulnerability can be attacked um it helps you to do your risk attacked um it helps you to do your risk attacked um it helps you to do your risk assessment figure out prioritization and assessment figure out prioritization and assessment figure out prioritization and so on but the exact same attack could be so on but the exact same attack could be so on but the exact same attack could be triggering any number of different triggering any number of different triggering any number of different weaknesses under the hood um deep inside weaknesses under the hood um deep inside weaknesses under the hood um deep inside the product. So let's take a pretty the product. So let's take a pretty the product. So let's take a pretty obvious seeming example. Let's say I obvious seeming example. Let's say I obvious seeming example. Let's say I have an input for a username and I have an input for a username and I have an input for a username and I provide a thousand a characters right provide a thousand a characters right provide a thousand a characters right standard buffer overflow kind of standard buffer overflow kind of standard buffer overflow kind of exploit. um I could wind up causing exploit. um I could wind up causing exploit. um I could wind up causing crashes due to excessive memory crashes due to excessive memory crashes due to excessive memory allocation. Maybe I trigger some kind of allocation. Maybe I trigger some kind of allocation. Maybe I trigger some kind of recursive um excessive recursion or recursive um excessive recursion or recursive um excessive recursion or something like that using a string something like that using a string something like that using a string that's typically associated with buffer that's typically associated with buffer that's typically associated with buffer overflows. On the attacker side, I just overflows. On the attacker side, I just overflows. On the attacker side, I just don't have the insights into what the don't have the insights into what the don't have the insights into what the underlying weaknesses underlying weaknesses underlying weaknesses are. And then there's a tendency for are. And then there's a tendency for are. And then there's a tendency for people an understandable tendency to people an understandable tendency to people an understandable tendency to characterize some problems in terms of characterize some problems in terms of characterize some problems in terms of the lack of particular mitigations like the lack of particular mitigations like the lack of particular mitigations like oh you didn't validate your input oh you didn't validate your input oh you didn't validate your input correctly or you're using SQL but you correctly or you're using SQL but you correctly or you're using SQL but you didn't parameterize your your SQL query didn't parameterize your your SQL query didn't parameterize your your SQL query or you didn't use you know query or you didn't use you know query or you didn't use you know query parameterization at all. um to you know parameterization at all. um to you know parameterization at all. um to you know reference a common quote from Katie reference a common quote from Katie reference a common quote from Katie Msaurus. Every vulnerability is a unique Msaurus. Every vulnerability is a unique Msaurus. Every vulnerability is a unique snowflake especially when it comes down snowflake especially when it comes down snowflake especially when it comes down to the specific code underneath. Many to the specific code underneath. Many to the specific code underneath. Many vulnerabilities could likely be vulnerabilities could likely be vulnerabilities could likely be addressed by multiple different addressed by multiple different addressed by multiple different mitigations and it's really dependent on mitigations and it's really dependent on mitigations and it's really dependent on the context in which the code is being the context in which the code is being the context in which the code is being used in the code itself to figure out used in the code itself to figure out used in the code itself to figure out which mitigation which mitigation which mitigation um uh is is really appropriate. So to um uh is is really appropriate. So to um uh is is really appropriate. So to characterize weaknesses in terms of the characterize weaknesses in terms of the characterize weaknesses in terms of the absence or the misuse of certain absence or the misuse of certain absence or the misuse of certain mitigations is often not going to be mitigations is often not going to be mitigations is often not going to be particularly um particularly um particularly um useful. And another thing is that CWE useful. And another thing is that CWE useful. And another thing is that CWE weaknesses really are organized around weaknesses really are organized around weaknesses really are organized around behaviors trying to get into the behaviors trying to get into the behaviors trying to get into the specifics about what does the product do specifics about what does the product do specifics about what does the product do wrong that introduces uh wrong that introduces uh wrong that introduces uh vulnerabilities. We also have, thanks to the We also have, thanks to the We also have, thanks to the vulnerability world, a lot of vague or vulnerability world, a lot of vague or vulnerability world, a lot of vague or vulnerability related terminology that's vulnerability related terminology that's vulnerability related terminology that's grown and developed over the years, but grown and developed over the years, but grown and developed over the years, but it it's not like everybody when they say it it's not like everybody when they say it it's not like everybody when they say the same word actually means the same the same word actually means the same the same word actually means the same thing. Let's take just the phrase buffer thing. Let's take just the phrase buffer thing. Let's take just the phrase buffer overflow. Okay, if I were to do I did an overflow. Okay, if I were to do I did an overflow. Okay, if I were to do I did an informal poll a couple years ago and informal poll a couple years ago and informal poll a couple years ago and said, "How many people think that when said, "How many people think that when said, "How many people think that when you say buffer overflow that it means you say buffer overflow that it means you say buffer overflow that it means that you are doing a right past the end that you are doing a right past the end that you are doing a right past the end of a buffer?" And in that poll, which of a buffer?" And in that poll, which of a buffer?" And in that poll, which had about 100 respondents, about 70% had about 100 respondents, about 70% had about 100 respondents, about 70% said, "Yep, that's exactly what a buffer said, "Yep, that's exactly what a buffer said, "Yep, that's exactly what a buffer overflow is." But what that means is 30% overflow is." But what that means is 30% overflow is." But what that means is 30% had other meanings for what they what had other meanings for what they what had other meanings for what they what they meant by buffer overflow or how to they meant by buffer overflow or how to they meant by buffer overflow or how to interpret it. A lot of tool vendors in interpret it. A lot of tool vendors in interpret it. A lot of tool vendors in the early days for them reading or the early days for them reading or the early days for them reading or writing outside the boundary of a buffer writing outside the boundary of a buffer writing outside the boundary of a buffer it didn't matter based on what their it didn't matter based on what their it didn't matter based on what their detection methodologies were. Those were detection methodologies were. Those were detection methodologies were. Those were buffer overflows. And so you get these buffer overflows. And so you get these buffer overflows. And so you get these different kinds of variations of the different kinds of variations of the different kinds of variations of the same of interpretations of the exact same of interpretations of the exact same of interpretations of the exact same phrase that we've all known and same phrase that we've all known and same phrase that we've all known and used for decades. Um, another one of my used for decades. Um, another one of my used for decades. Um, another one of my favorites is Stack Overflow. The, uh, favorites is Stack Overflow. The, uh, favorites is Stack Overflow. The, uh, address sanitizer tool, which is used address sanitizer tool, which is used address sanitizer tool, which is used pretty heavily to catch, you know, pretty heavily to catch, you know, pretty heavily to catch, you know, memory management issues, often reports memory management issues, often reports memory management issues, often reports stack overflows. Now, you might think stack overflows. Now, you might think stack overflows. Now, you might think that that means stackbased buffer that that means stackbased buffer that that means stackbased buffer overflow, but near as I can tell, it overflow, but near as I can tell, it overflow, but near as I can tell, it means excessive consumption where you're means excessive consumption where you're means excessive consumption where you're allocating and using up too much of the allocating and using up too much of the allocating and using up too much of the program stack, not related to um, program stack, not related to um, program stack, not related to um, writing past the boundaries of a buffer writing past the boundaries of a buffer writing past the boundaries of a buffer at all. And then another one of my at all. And then another one of my at all. And then another one of my favorites is memory elite. You know, favorites is memory elite. You know, favorites is memory elite. You know, does memory leak mean that you've does memory leak mean that you've does memory leak mean that you've inserted some sensitive information into inserted some sensitive information into inserted some sensitive information into memory that is then accessible to an memory that is then accessible to an memory that is then accessible to an attacker or does it mean that you're attacker or does it mean that you're attacker or does it mean that you're allocating bits and pieces of memory and allocating bits and pieces of memory and allocating bits and pieces of memory and you're not freeing it after you use it? you're not freeing it after you use it? you're not freeing it after you use it? Uh, and then thus, you know, creating a Uh, and then thus, you know, creating a Uh, and then thus, you know, creating a lot of additional uh excess memory that lot of additional uh excess memory that lot of additional uh excess memory that you're never you're never you're never releasing. These kinds of terminology releasing. These kinds of terminology releasing. These kinds of terminology differences are a fundamental part of differences are a fundamental part of differences are a fundamental part of our business, right? and they're a our business, right? and they're a our business, right? and they're a fundamental part of our communications fundamental part of our communications fundamental part of our communications and we can get around it for the most and we can get around it for the most and we can get around it for the most part. Um, but not when it gets to trying part. Um, but not when it gets to trying part. Um, but not when it gets to trying to make C.WE usable or understandable to to make C.WE usable or understandable to to make C.WE usable or understandable to people. And another realization that I people. And another realization that I people. And another realization that I had uh just recently is that a lot of had uh just recently is that a lot of had uh just recently is that a lot of people don't really even know how to do people don't really even know how to do people don't really even know how to do root cause analysis in the first place. root cause analysis in the first place. root cause analysis in the first place. To do so, you really need to have a To do so, you really need to have a To do so, you really need to have a certain set of background skills. You certain set of background skills. You certain set of background skills. You need to know you know the particular need to know you know the particular need to know you know the particular programming language uh that the programming language uh that the programming language uh that the vulnerability is written in. The vulnerability is written in. The vulnerability is written in. The underlying protocol or uh framework underlying protocol or uh framework underlying protocol or uh framework might be relevant to interpreting the might be relevant to interpreting the might be relevant to interpreting the vulnerability. The product might have a vulnerability. The product might have a vulnerability. The product might have a very specific uh you know domain that very specific uh you know domain that very specific uh you know domain that it's operating in or a certain threat it's operating in or a certain threat it's operating in or a certain threat model. You may need to be able to, you model. You may need to be able to, you model. You may need to be able to, you know, interpret from a proof of concept know, interpret from a proof of concept know, interpret from a proof of concept exploit to understand different attack exploit to understand different attack exploit to understand different attack inputs, uh, and to read through unstated inputs, uh, and to read through unstated inputs, uh, and to read through unstated or more obvious kinds of assumptions or more obvious kinds of assumptions or more obvious kinds of assumptions that are obvious to the person who wrote that are obvious to the person who wrote that are obvious to the person who wrote the report but not the necessarily the the report but not the necessarily the the report but not the necessarily the person who's doing the root cause person who's doing the root cause person who's doing the root cause analysis. And you really can't map to analysis. And you really can't map to analysis. And you really can't map to the best C.WE if you just don't clearly the best C.WE if you just don't clearly the best C.WE if you just don't clearly understand the weakness or you don't understand the weakness or you don't understand the weakness or you don't understand the unstated assumptions or understand the unstated assumptions or understand the unstated assumptions or the underlying domain or threat model. the underlying domain or threat model. the underlying domain or threat model. In addition, now that it's, you know, In addition, now that it's, you know, In addition, now that it's, you know, almost 20 years later since the almost 20 years later since the almost 20 years later since the beginning of CWE and and going further beginning of CWE and and going further beginning of CWE and and going further than that, uh, we now have a lot of than that, uh, we now have a lot of than that, uh, we now have a lot of weaknessoriented chain analysis. You weaknessoriented chain analysis. You weaknessoriented chain analysis. You know, some companies such as Red Hat are know, some companies such as Red Hat are know, some companies such as Red Hat are doing this pretty extensively. But what doing this pretty extensively. But what doing this pretty extensively. But what chains do is they separate the primary chains do is they separate the primary chains do is they separate the primary issues, the real root causes from the issues, the real root causes from the issues, the real root causes from the more resultant issues. And let's take more resultant issues. And let's take more resultant issues. And let's take for examples out of bounds, write or use for examples out of bounds, write or use for examples out of bounds, write or use after free. If your code is getting to a after free. If your code is getting to a after free. If your code is getting to a point where it is writing data out of point where it is writing data out of point where it is writing data out of bounds or where it is accessing, you bounds or where it is accessing, you bounds or where it is accessing, you know, some kind of buffer after it has know, some kind of buffer after it has know, some kind of buffer after it has been freed, it already made another been freed, it already made another been freed, it already made another mistake, a root cause mistake earlier in mistake, a root cause mistake earlier in mistake, a root cause mistake earlier in the process. But it's only recently that the process. But it's only recently that the process. But it's only recently that there's been greater attention paid to there's been greater attention paid to there's been greater attention paid to these kinds of chains. And so that's a these kinds of chains. And so that's a these kinds of chains. And so that's a further complication here. As we think further complication here. As we think further complication here. As we think about root cause analysis, there are also a number of analysis, there are also a number of analysis, there are also a number of different mapping assumptions that are different mapping assumptions that are different mapping assumptions that are made that are pretty common. One of them made that are pretty common. One of them made that are pretty common. One of them is taking choosing higher level mappings is taking choosing higher level mappings is taking choosing higher level mappings when lower level mappings are available. when lower level mappings are available. when lower level mappings are available. Uh maybe a higher level mapping is Uh maybe a higher level mapping is Uh maybe a higher level mapping is something that uh shows up first when something that uh shows up first when something that uh shows up first when you're doing matching. And one common you're doing matching. And one common you're doing matching. And one common example is CWE77 which says command example is CWE77 which says command example is CWE77 which says command injection. people might choose that for injection. people might choose that for injection. people might choose that for an OS command injection issue, which is an OS command injection issue, which is an OS command injection issue, which is actually CWE78, a lower level C.WE that actually CWE78, a lower level C.WE that actually CWE78, a lower level C.WE that it's available. For many people, when it's available. For many people, when it's available. For many people, when they think about commands, they only they think about commands, they only they think about commands, they only really think about shell commands, but really think about shell commands, but really think about shell commands, but there's lots of different command there's lots of different command there's lots of different command languages, and that's what the more languages, and that's what the more languages, and that's what the more general CWE77 is for. In addition, general CWE77 is for. In addition, general CWE77 is for. In addition, people who do vulnerability impact kind people who do vulnerability impact kind people who do vulnerability impact kind of thinking might be like, well, if an of thinking might be like, well, if an of thinking might be like, well, if an attacker can provide and execute OS attacker can provide and execute OS attacker can provide and execute OS commands, that means OS command commands, that means OS command commands, that means OS command injection. And in that sense, yes. Um, injection. And in that sense, yes. Um, injection. And in that sense, yes. Um, but a lot of exploits use other kinds of but a lot of exploits use other kinds of but a lot of exploits use other kinds of weaknesses, other kinds of mistakes, and weaknesses, other kinds of mistakes, and weaknesses, other kinds of mistakes, and they want to prove remote code ex remote they want to prove remote code ex remote they want to prove remote code ex remote code execution. So, they're going to go code execution. So, they're going to go code execution. So, they're going to go and execute shell commands. They're and execute shell commands. They're and execute shell commands. They're going to go and pop kelp. Um, but really going to go and pop kelp. Um, but really going to go and pop kelp. Um, but really what CW78, the lower level OS command what CW78, the lower level OS command what CW78, the lower level OS command injection weakness is talking about is injection weakness is talking about is injection weakness is talking about is when the product is intentionally trying when the product is intentionally trying when the product is intentionally trying to construct an an OS command using to construct an an OS command using to construct an an OS command using externally influenced input. Um, so externally influenced input. Um, so externally influenced input. Um, so these are some areas where there can be these are some areas where there can be these are some areas where there can be different kinds of mapping assumptions different kinds of mapping assumptions different kinds of mapping assumptions or mapping errors where people choose or mapping errors where people choose or mapping errors where people choose higher level more general CWEs when higher level more general CWEs when higher level more general CWEs when lower level C.WE are more lower level C.WE are more lower level C.WE are more applicable. Then there are I think what applicable. Then there are I think what applicable. Then there are I think what sometimes uh uh are simplistic root sometimes uh uh are simplistic root sometimes uh uh are simplistic root cause assumptions that people make. Uh cause assumptions that people make. Uh cause assumptions that people make. Uh one of the most common ones that I one of the most common ones that I one of the most common ones that I struggle against is people who think struggle against is people who think struggle against is people who think that injection errors are due to poor that injection errors are due to poor that injection errors are due to poor input validation. And that's not really input validation. And that's not really input validation. And that's not really true. Input validation helps a lot with true. Input validation helps a lot with true. Input validation helps a lot with injection errors. But especially when injection errors. But especially when injection errors. But especially when you're, you know, building up complex you're, you know, building up complex you're, you know, building up complex data structures or data outputs, it's data structures or data outputs, it's data structures or data outputs, it's really ultimately about properly really ultimately about properly really ultimately about properly encoding your outputs so that you're encoding your outputs so that you're encoding your outputs so that you're ensuring that you're separating the data ensuring that you're separating the data ensuring that you're separating the data from the control. At any rate, these from the control. At any rate, these from the control. At any rate, these different kinds of simplistic different kinds of simplistic different kinds of simplistic assumptions might be made and then that assumptions might be made and then that assumptions might be made and then that can lead you into different parts of can lead you into different parts of can lead you into different parts of this of classifying the the root cause this of classifying the the root cause this of classifying the the root cause than one might uh anticipate or than one than one might uh anticipate or than one than one might uh anticipate or than one might hope. Another factor in mapping is which views Another factor in mapping is which views Another factor in mapping is which views uh people are using. We do have a couple uh people are using. We do have a couple uh people are using. We do have a couple views that are uh really complete that views that are uh really complete that views that are uh really complete that they cover all 943 weaknesses of uh in they cover all 943 weaknesses of uh in they cover all 943 weaknesses of uh in CW4.17. The most well-known one is the CW4.17. The most well-known one is the CW4.17. The most well-known one is the research view 1000 which is only research view 1000 which is only research view 1000 which is only consistent of weaknesses. But as of consistent of weaknesses. But as of consistent of weaknesses. But as of about a year or two, we also created a about a year or two, we also created a about a year or two, we also created a separate view of comprehensive separate view of comprehensive separate view of comprehensive categories which is a two-layer view categories which is a two-layer view categories which is a two-layer view which has 22 mutually exclusive which has 22 mutually exclusive which has 22 mutually exclusive categories at the top and with every categories at the top and with every categories at the top and with every other single weakness hanging underneath other single weakness hanging underneath other single weakness hanging underneath it. An example of one category in this it. An example of one category in this it. An example of one category in this view is memory safety. Um, memory safety view is memory safety. Um, memory safety view is memory safety. Um, memory safety is sort of scattered throughout the is sort of scattered throughout the is sort of scattered throughout the research view because the behaviors research view because the behaviors research view because the behaviors involved in memory safety actually vary involved in memory safety actually vary involved in memory safety actually vary widely, but they're nicely collected in widely, but they're nicely collected in widely, but they're nicely collected in the comprehensive view under a single the comprehensive view under a single the comprehensive view under a single uh, CW uh, CW uh, CW category. A lot of views um, by design category. A lot of views um, by design category. A lot of views um, by design really intentionally only use a subset really intentionally only use a subset really intentionally only use a subset of weaknesses. So there's view 10003 of weaknesses. So there's view 10003 of weaknesses. So there's view 10003 which is uh, has been used traditionally which is uh, has been used traditionally which is uh, has been used traditionally heavily by NVD and by many others. heavily by NVD and by many others. heavily by NVD and by many others. There's view 1194 which is a hardware There's view 1194 which is a hardware There's view 1194 which is a hardware specific view. And then there's a more specific view. And then there's a more specific view. And then there's a more developer friendly view 699 developer friendly view 699 developer friendly view 699 um that sees quite a bit of use as well. um that sees quite a bit of use as well. um that sees quite a bit of use as well. Even view 699 though only covers about Even view 699 though only covers about Even view 699 though only covers about 400 C.WE entries or something along 400 C.WE entries or something along 400 C.WE entries or something along those lines, not all 900 those lines, not all 900 those lines, not all 900 plus. And a point to make is that plus. And a point to make is that plus. And a point to make is that reliance on these kinds of incomplete reliance on these kinds of incomplete reliance on these kinds of incomplete views can then further affect mapping views can then further affect mapping views can then further affect mapping accuracy and precision. accuracy and precision. accuracy and precision. We also have some occasional situations We also have some occasional situations We also have some occasional situations where the same the exact same where the same the exact same where the same the exact same vulnerability the the exact same issue vulnerability the the exact same issue vulnerability the the exact same issue could potentially be mapped to multiple could potentially be mapped to multiple could potentially be mapped to multiple CWEs at different layers of abstraction. CWEs at different layers of abstraction. CWEs at different layers of abstraction. Um that's a fine detail. I'm not going Um that's a fine detail. I'm not going Um that's a fine detail. I'm not going to get into it today for uh purpose of to get into it today for uh purpose of to get into it today for uh purpose of time. All right. So what are we doing? time. All right. So what are we doing? time. All right. So what are we doing? What are we going to do for improving What are we going to do for improving What are we going to do for improving CWE content? CWE content? CWE content? We want to make sure that CWE is more We want to make sure that CWE is more We want to make sure that CWE is more clearly recognizable and applicable clearly recognizable and applicable clearly recognizable and applicable either to new users or to um people who either to new users or to um people who either to new users or to um people who are operating in new kinds of domains. are operating in new kinds of domains. are operating in new kinds of domains. One of the challenges here is that um we One of the challenges here is that um we One of the challenges here is that um we have tried to systematically organize have tried to systematically organize have tried to systematically organize weaknesses using the vulnerability weaknesses using the vulnerability weaknesses using the vulnerability theory framework which has its own theory framework which has its own theory framework which has its own special concepts and terms that people special concepts and terms that people special concepts and terms that people are just not necessarily going to be are just not necessarily going to be are just not necessarily going to be familiar with. In addition, a re uh familiar with. In addition, a re uh familiar with. In addition, a re uh realization that I've had in recent realization that I've had in recent realization that I've had in recent years is that theory is hard to teach years is that theory is hard to teach years is that theory is hard to teach without teaching people about more without teaching people about more without teaching people about more specific examples. And this is something specific examples. And this is something specific examples. And this is something that applies across all different kinds that applies across all different kinds that applies across all different kinds of industries and specialties, not just of industries and specialties, not just of industries and specialties, not just uh cyber security, let alone CVE and uh cyber security, let alone CVE and uh cyber security, let alone CVE and CWE. CWE. CWE. Um, another realization I've had over Um, another realization I've had over Um, another realization I've had over the past couple years is that a lot of the past couple years is that a lot of the past couple years is that a lot of new technologies come out or there's a new technologies come out or there's a new technologies come out or there's a lot of interest in C.WE. ES for new lot of interest in C.WE. ES for new lot of interest in C.WE. ES for new technologies that turn out to mostly technologies that turn out to mostly technologies that turn out to mostly have more or less the same weaknesses have more or less the same weaknesses have more or less the same weaknesses but it's just not recognizable as such. but it's just not recognizable as such. but it's just not recognizable as such. Maybe the new technologies have do Maybe the new technologies have do Maybe the new technologies have do domain specific terminology or domain domain specific terminology or domain domain specific terminology or domain specific perspectives and we get a lot specific perspectives and we get a lot specific perspectives and we get a lot of requests or a lot of people saying I of requests or a lot of people saying I of requests or a lot of people saying I really like CWE XYZ but I want one for a really like CWE XYZ but I want one for a really like CWE XYZ but I want one for a specific kind of technology such as specific kind of technology such as specific kind of technology such as cloud or AI machine learning and so on. cloud or AI machine learning and so on. cloud or AI machine learning and so on. That's one area where we need to work on That's one area where we need to work on That's one area where we need to work on improving improving improving recognizability. And there are still recognizability. And there are still recognizability. And there are still some interesting gaps that these new some interesting gaps that these new some interesting gaps that these new technologies bring up. I don't want to I technologies bring up. I don't want to I technologies bring up. I don't want to I don't want to imagine otherwise. I don't don't want to imagine otherwise. I don't don't want to imagine otherwise. I don't want to state otherwise, but still want to state otherwise, but still want to state otherwise, but still there's a lot of stuff in there that there's a lot of stuff in there that there's a lot of stuff in there that needs to be able to be more recognizable needs to be able to be more recognizable needs to be able to be more recognizable to to to people. And we do have other content people. And we do have other content people. And we do have other content challenges like um disconnects between challenges like um disconnects between challenges like um disconnects between CWEs and descriptions where they're just CWEs and descriptions where they're just CWEs and descriptions where they're just not uh 100% in alignment. And that's a not uh 100% in alignment. And that's a not uh 100% in alignment. And that's a that's an area of of improvement I'd that's an area of of improvement I'd that's an area of of improvement I'd like to make over the coming years. And like to make over the coming years. And like to make over the coming years. And we also have to reflect that, you know, we also have to reflect that, you know, we also have to reflect that, you know, words and meanings change over time or words and meanings change over time or words and meanings change over time or with different audiences. I gave a with different audiences. I gave a with different audiences. I gave a couple examples a few slides ago about couple examples a few slides ago about couple examples a few slides ago about phrases like even buffer overflow, stack phrases like even buffer overflow, stack phrases like even buffer overflow, stack overflow, and memory leak. Um, but you overflow, and memory leak. Um, but you overflow, and memory leak. Um, but you know, for example, the phrase classic know, for example, the phrase classic know, for example, the phrase classic overflow is something that started overflow is something that started overflow is something that started emerging in mid to late 2000s. um emerging in mid to late 2000s. um emerging in mid to late 2000s. um because vulnerability researchers were because vulnerability researchers were because vulnerability researchers were finding weird kinds of nonobvious or finding weird kinds of nonobvious or finding weird kinds of nonobvious or less obvious buffer overflows besides less obvious buffer overflows besides less obvious buffer overflows besides where you're just stuffing way too much where you're just stuffing way too much where you're just stuffing way too much data into a buffer that's way too small data into a buffer that's way too small data into a buffer that's way too small to handle that data. Um I'm not sure to handle that data. Um I'm not sure to handle that data. Um I'm not sure what the phrase classic overflow means what the phrase classic overflow means what the phrase classic overflow means or is interpreted as anymore. Um and yet or is interpreted as anymore. Um and yet or is interpreted as anymore. Um and yet you know those those terms are or at you know those those terms are or at you know those those terms are or at least were at some point very in very least were at some point very in very least were at some point very in very common use. Um, we also have a handful common use. Um, we also have a handful common use. Um, we also have a handful of CWEs that really need some kind of of CWEs that really need some kind of of CWEs that really need some kind of deprecation or some kind of significant deprecation or some kind of significant deprecation or some kind of significant change. Uh, one of which actually was in change. Uh, one of which actually was in change. Uh, one of which actually was in the top 25. Um, but they seem the top 25. Um, but they seem the top 25. Um, but they seem recognizable and applicable to people. recognizable and applicable to people. recognizable and applicable to people. So, people still use them. And some of So, people still use them. And some of So, people still use them. And some of these are really very popular. So, one these are really very popular. So, one these are really very popular. So, one thing we need to figure out is how do we thing we need to figure out is how do we thing we need to figure out is how do we deprecate these or otherwise change them deprecate these or otherwise change them deprecate these or otherwise change them significantly, but do it in ways that significantly, but do it in ways that significantly, but do it in ways that minimize disruption to all of C.WE's minimize disruption to all of C.WE's minimize disruption to all of C.WE's users. users. users. We have a number of different questions We have a number of different questions We have a number of different questions that we face as we want to build up that we face as we want to build up that we face as we want to build up C.WE. Um do our content generation C.WE. Um do our content generation C.WE. Um do our content generation faster and uh and with more and one of faster and uh and with more and one of faster and uh and with more and one of the main questions we want to ask is how the main questions we want to ask is how the main questions we want to ask is how much does CWE really need to grow? How much does CWE really need to grow? How much does CWE really need to grow? How many new CWEs are really needed and by many new CWEs are really needed and by many new CWEs are really needed and by whom? You know, we have some people who whom? You know, we have some people who whom? You know, we have some people who are like, "Oh, there's too many CWEs are like, "Oh, there's too many CWEs are like, "Oh, there's too many CWEs already." And others who are like, "No, already." And others who are like, "No, already." And others who are like, "No, I want lots and lots of subvariants, I want lots and lots of subvariants, I want lots and lots of subvariants, subatomic variants, and so on." We subatomic variants, and so on." We subatomic variants, and so on." We obviously can't make both parties happy. obviously can't make both parties happy. obviously can't make both parties happy. Um, but we need to serve the needs as Um, but we need to serve the needs as Um, but we need to serve the needs as best we can of both kinds of parties. best we can of both kinds of parties. best we can of both kinds of parties. Another area of uh completeness is, you Another area of uh completeness is, you Another area of uh completeness is, you know, how many existing CWEs really know, how many existing CWEs really know, how many existing CWEs really still need some key elements provided. still need some key elements provided. still need some key elements provided. you know, the quality expectations have you know, the quality expectations have you know, the quality expectations have grown over the years, the completeness grown over the years, the completeness grown over the years, the completeness expectations have grown over the years. expectations have grown over the years. expectations have grown over the years. Um, we still have a, you know, an older Um, we still have a, you know, an older Um, we still have a, you know, an older repository which needs a lot more repository which needs a lot more repository which needs a lot more attention paid to it maintenance-wise to attention paid to it maintenance-wise to attention paid to it maintenance-wise to really make it much more complete and really make it much more complete and really make it much more complete and useful to users. Um, and we consider, useful to users. Um, and we consider, useful to users. Um, and we consider, you know, use cases and personas as part you know, use cases and personas as part you know, use cases and personas as part of that prioritization. also in of that prioritization. also in of that prioritization. also in consultation with our user experience consultation with our user experience consultation with our user experience working group. We've done some of this working group. We've done some of this working group. We've done some of this work in the work in the work in the past. Um we've had community involvement past. Um we've had community involvement past. Um we've had community involvement since the beginning, but we do have a since the beginning, but we do have a since the beginning, but we do have a lot more active regular community lot more active regular community lot more active regular community involvement and engagement, including involvement and engagement, including involvement and engagement, including the CDR, the content development the CDR, the content development the CDR, the content development repository, where people who submit repository, where people who submit repository, where people who submit suggested changes to C.WE can go and suggested changes to C.WE can go and suggested changes to C.WE can go and then monitor and track the changes as we then monitor and track the changes as we then monitor and track the changes as we conduct reviews and make modifications conduct reviews and make modifications conduct reviews and make modifications to those suggestions. and then to those suggestions. and then to those suggestions. and then ultimately integrate them into C.WE. ultimately integrate them into C.WE. ultimately integrate them into C.WE. Um, these days though, it's difficult to Um, these days though, it's difficult to Um, these days though, it's difficult to really write what counts as a good C.WE really write what counts as a good C.WE really write what counts as a good C.WE based on quality expectations. That's based on quality expectations. That's based on quality expectations. That's assuming we can get to the point of assuming we can get to the point of assuming we can get to the point of understanding what the weakness is in understanding what the weakness is in understanding what the weakness is in the first place. A lot of issues, a lot the first place. A lot of issues, a lot the first place. A lot of issues, a lot of vulnerabilities are easily understood of vulnerabilities are easily understood of vulnerabilities are easily understood by other kinds of criteria, but it can by other kinds of criteria, but it can by other kinds of criteria, but it can be very difficult to tease out what the be very difficult to tease out what the be very difficult to tease out what the underlying weakness is in the first underlying weakness is in the first underlying weakness is in the first place. And so, there's a lot of work place. And so, there's a lot of work place. And so, there's a lot of work that goes on in there. And we've dealt that goes on in there. And we've dealt that goes on in there. And we've dealt with a lot of public CDR submissions with a lot of public CDR submissions with a lot of public CDR submissions that it's like it's not really clear that it's like it's not really clear that it's like it's not really clear what the underlying weakness is and it what the underlying weakness is and it what the underlying weakness is and it requires a lot of back and forth to kind requires a lot of back and forth to kind requires a lot of back and forth to kind of figure that out. And the quality of figure that out. And the quality of figure that out. And the quality guidelines in general, they exist. guidelines in general, they exist. guidelines in general, they exist. They're not as formal as a specific line They're not as formal as a specific line They're not as formal as a specific line item checklist, but they're close, but item checklist, but they're close, but item checklist, but they're close, but they're pages and pages and it's still they're pages and pages and it's still they're pages and pages and it's still way too much for people who just want to way too much for people who just want to way too much for people who just want to contribute casually to C.WE. contribute casually to C.WE. contribute casually to C.WE. And we also face questions. So I've And we also face questions. So I've And we also face questions. So I've talked a little bit about entry talked a little bit about entry talked a little bit about entry completeness and entry quality um and completeness and entry quality um and completeness and entry quality um and element quality um of the individual element quality um of the individual element quality um of the individual elements. Uh but we also need to elements. Uh but we also need to elements. Uh but we also need to consider timeliness, right? We want CWE consider timeliness, right? We want CWE consider timeliness, right? We want CWE to put out new stuff as quickly as to put out new stuff as quickly as to put out new stuff as quickly as possible, but what if what we put out possible, but what if what we put out possible, but what if what we put out isn't perfect. It's a little bit more isn't perfect. It's a little bit more isn't perfect. It's a little bit more easily handable uh handleable if we're easily handable uh handleable if we're easily handable uh handleable if we're making modifications to existing C.WE. making modifications to existing C.WE. making modifications to existing C.WE. Uh Drew Butner, who used to be the CW Uh Drew Butner, who used to be the CW Uh Drew Butner, who used to be the CW project lead, would always frame project lead, would always frame project lead, would always frame questions as if we make this questions as if we make this questions as if we make this modification, is the entry better than modification, is the entry better than modification, is the entry better than it was? And if so, that's a pretty good it was? And if so, that's a pretty good it was? And if so, that's a pretty good criterion for making updates to new criterion for making updates to new criterion for making updates to new entries at the very least. But we still entries at the very least. But we still entries at the very least. But we still need to consider balancing the need to consider balancing the need to consider balancing the timeliness with the quality that we're timeliness with the quality that we're timeliness with the quality that we're producing. We don't want to put out C.WE producing. We don't want to put out C.WE producing. We don't want to put out C.WE we that are patently inaccurate or we that are patently inaccurate or we that are patently inaccurate or effectively tell you know developers to effectively tell you know developers to effectively tell you know developers to do things that are fundamentally do things that are fundamentally do things that are fundamentally insecure or say to apply a mitigation insecure or say to apply a mitigation insecure or say to apply a mitigation that really doesn't help um even though that really doesn't help um even though that really doesn't help um even though it might be something that a lot of it might be something that a lot of it might be something that a lot of people do. So we want to really balance people do. So we want to really balance people do. So we want to really balance out that quality and the speed. out that quality and the speed. out that quality and the speed. Speaking of Speaking of Speaking of quality, let's take a look at a at an quality, let's take a look at a at an quality, let's take a look at a at an original demonstrative example by some original demonstrative example by some original demonstrative example by some guy named oh Steve Christie. And that guy named oh Steve Christie. And that guy named oh Steve Christie. And that was his name at the time. So that's how was his name at the time. So that's how was his name at the time. So that's how long ago it is. Just take a quick look long ago it is. Just take a quick look long ago it is. Just take a quick look at this demonstrative example from CWE95 at this demonstrative example from CWE95 at this demonstrative example from CWE95 eval injection. Took a long time to write up injection. Took a long time to write up injection. Took a long time to write up this example. Um, and hey, it's got some this example. Um, and hey, it's got some this example. Um, and hey, it's got some pretty good-looking code here. It's kind pretty good-looking code here. It's kind pretty good-looking code here. It's kind of realistic, but maybe it's too of realistic, but maybe it's too of realistic, but maybe it's too realistic. Um, it's written in a realistic. Um, it's written in a realistic. Um, it's written in a language called Pearl, which who writes language called Pearl, which who writes language called Pearl, which who writes Pearl these days? But this is one of the Pearl these days? But this is one of the Pearl these days? But this is one of the challenges for any kind of demonstrative challenges for any kind of demonstrative challenges for any kind of demonstrative example, right? If it's written in a example, right? If it's written in a example, right? If it's written in a language that the reader doesn't language that the reader doesn't language that the reader doesn't understand, then there's only so much understand, then there's only so much understand, then there's only so much you can really do. Um, uh, you know, you can really do. Um, uh, you know, you can really do. Um, uh, you know, this is an old C.WE. This was, um, this this is an old C.WE. This was, um, this this is an old C.WE. This was, um, this demonstrative example was put into C.WE demonstrative example was put into C.WE demonstrative example was put into C.WE we before CWE.0. So there's there's this we before CWE.0. So there's there's this we before CWE.0. So there's there's this technology called CGI that used to exist technology called CGI that used to exist technology called CGI that used to exist um still exists, but it used to be more um still exists, but it used to be more um still exists, but it used to be more better wellknown or understood back better wellknown or understood back better wellknown or understood back then. Um and there's just a lot of then. Um and there's just a lot of then. Um and there's just a lot of excess code here in a way uh because excess code here in a way uh because excess code here in a way uh because it's trying to be a little bit too it's trying to be a little bit too it's trying to be a little bit too realistic. Um, but it's just not realistic. Um, but it's just not realistic. Um, but it's just not necessarily going to be understandable necessarily going to be understandable necessarily going to be understandable to a lot of readers. But it's definitely to a lot of readers. But it's definitely to a lot of readers. But it's definitely a little bit too extensive to as a first a little bit too extensive to as a first a little bit too extensive to as a first example to present to your users. And example to present to your users. And example to present to your users. And yet it's still pretty good and still, yet it's still pretty good and still, yet it's still pretty good and still, you know, it wouldn't satisfy every you know, it wouldn't satisfy every you know, it wouldn't satisfy every single checkbox for our quality single checkbox for our quality single checkbox for our quality expectations uh these days, but it's expectations uh these days, but it's expectations uh these days, but it's still pretty good. But we have a lot of still pretty good. But we have a lot of still pretty good. But we have a lot of content that's like this that we have we content that's like this that we have we content that's like this that we have we have examples, we have them filled out, have examples, we have them filled out, have examples, we have them filled out, but they aren't necessarily up to snuff but they aren't necessarily up to snuff but they aren't necessarily up to snuff relative to our current quality relative to our current quality relative to our current quality expectations. And one general question, expectations. And one general question, expectations. And one general question, and this is for the the public entirely, and this is for the the public entirely, and this is for the the public entirely, is what quality expectations should the is what quality expectations should the is what quality expectations should the general public have? What cases is it general public have? What cases is it general public have? What cases is it okay for us to reduce or let go of okay for us to reduce or let go of okay for us to reduce or let go of certain quality certain quality certain quality expectations to not allow perfect to expectations to not allow perfect to expectations to not allow perfect to become the enemy of the good? basically. become the enemy of the good? basically. become the enemy of the good? basically. So that's just a general question uh So that's just a general question uh So that's just a general question uh we'd love to hear from you we'd love to hear from you we'd love to hear from you about. Now I want to talk about other about. Now I want to talk about other about. Now I want to talk about other challenges we have especially with challenges we have especially with challenges we have especially with adding new entries to C.WE. Uh where we adding new entries to C.WE. Uh where we adding new entries to C.WE. Uh where we have to deal with questions of have to deal with questions of have to deal with questions of abstraction and especially preventing abstraction and especially preventing abstraction and especially preventing overlap. We don't want to put new overlap. We don't want to put new overlap. We don't want to put new entries into C.WE that overlap other entries into C.WE that overlap other entries into C.WE that overlap other entries. It's just just plain bad. Then entries. It's just just plain bad. Then entries. It's just just plain bad. Then what happens is we have proposals that what happens is we have proposals that what happens is we have proposals that can then become difficult to squeeze can then become difficult to squeeze can then become difficult to squeeze into an existing hierarchy. So to give uh a more easy to hierarchy. So to give uh a more easy to hierarchy. So to give uh a more easy to understand example, let's talk about understand example, let's talk about understand example, let's talk about animal classification. Let's say that animal classification. Let's say that animal classification. Let's say that we're coming up with a with a scheme to we're coming up with a with a scheme to we're coming up with a with a scheme to classify animals based on the number of classify animals based on the number of classify animals based on the number of legs and the number of arms. Um we have legs and the number of arms. Um we have legs and the number of arms. Um we have here a nice little layout. Okay, we've here a nice little layout. Okay, we've here a nice little layout. Okay, we've got, you know, humans and kangaroos have got, you know, humans and kangaroos have got, you know, humans and kangaroos have two legs and two arms. Uh, horses have two legs and two arms. Uh, horses have two legs and two arms. Uh, horses have four, you know, four legs and no arms. four, you know, four legs and no arms. four, you know, four legs and no arms. And then an immediate question is, well, And then an immediate question is, well, And then an immediate question is, well, is there anything out there with two is there anything out there with two is there anything out there with two legs and zero arms or four legs and two legs and zero arms or four legs and two legs and zero arms or four legs and two arms? Um, you know, maybe that's an area arms? Um, you know, maybe that's an area arms? Um, you know, maybe that's an area where we could beef up our hierarchy. where we could beef up our hierarchy. where we could beef up our hierarchy. Sure. Okay. Birds, you could say that Sure. Okay. Birds, you could say that Sure. Okay. Birds, you could say that birds have two legs and zero arms. But birds have two legs and zero arms. But birds have two legs and zero arms. But then you get into a philosophical then you get into a philosophical then you get into a philosophical question of like, well, are wings arms? question of like, well, are wings arms? question of like, well, are wings arms? Do we maybe need to define wings as Do we maybe need to define wings as Do we maybe need to define wings as certain kinds of arms? And then you've certain kinds of arms? And then you've certain kinds of arms? And then you've got centaurs, right? Centaurs have four got centaurs, right? Centaurs have four got centaurs, right? Centaurs have four legs and two arms, at least as I legs and two arms, at least as I legs and two arms, at least as I understand it. But then you might also understand it. But then you might also understand it. But then you might also be like, well, do centaurs centaurs are be like, well, do centaurs centaurs are be like, well, do centaurs centaurs are fictional? And some people might say fictional? And some people might say fictional? And some people might say birds aren't real, so should we even be birds aren't real, so should we even be birds aren't real, so should we even be be including those in the first place? be including those in the first place? be including those in the first place? And then some smart alec comes along and And then some smart alec comes along and And then some smart alec comes along and asks, well, what about an octopus? How asks, well, what about an octopus? How asks, well, what about an octopus? How do we cover an octopus? And then you get do we cover an octopus? And then you get do we cover an octopus? And then you get into the question of like, well, does an into the question of like, well, does an into the question of like, well, does an octopus have eight legs and zero arms or octopus have eight legs and zero arms or octopus have eight legs and zero arms or does it have zero legs and eight arms? does it have zero legs and eight arms? does it have zero legs and eight arms? But we're talking about a combination of But we're talking about a combination of But we're talking about a combination of legs and arms. Two different kinds of legs and arms. Two different kinds of legs and arms. Two different kinds of dimensions here. And maybe we need to dimensions here. And maybe we need to dimensions here. And maybe we need to define pick one and then define what we define pick one and then define what we define pick one and then define what we mean by legs and then also define what mean by legs and then also define what mean by legs and then also define what we mean by arms. we mean by arms. we mean by arms. So our nice clean prettyl looking So our nice clean prettyl looking So our nice clean prettyl looking hierarchy is starting to get a little hierarchy is starting to get a little hierarchy is starting to get a little bit bit bit messier. So then along comes somebody messier. So then along comes somebody messier. So then along comes somebody else and says hey you know it's really else and says hey you know it's really else and says hey you know it's really important that some animals lay eggs. So important that some animals lay eggs. So important that some animals lay eggs. So we should have some kind of identifier we should have some kind of identifier we should have some kind of identifier for all animals that lay eggs. Um and for all animals that lay eggs. Um and for all animals that lay eggs. Um and okay so that covers octopus wherever okay so that covers octopus wherever okay so that covers octopus wherever that lives covers birds and platypus that lives covers birds and platypus that lives covers birds and platypus they live in other parts of the they live in other parts of the they live in other parts of the hierarchy. We can't create a single ID hierarchy. We can't create a single ID hierarchy. We can't create a single ID or a single um you know central node or a single um you know central node or a single um you know central node that covers those three without that covers those three without that covers those three without otherwise breaking other kinds of pretty otherwise breaking other kinds of pretty otherwise breaking other kinds of pretty clean looking relationships. And then clean looking relationships. And then clean looking relationships. And then also you get into a question of uh also you get into a question of uh also you get into a question of uh chairs. Some somebody might be like oh chairs. Some somebody might be like oh chairs. Some somebody might be like oh this this works for classifying chairs. this this works for classifying chairs. this this works for classifying chairs. All right a chair is not an animal. All right a chair is not an animal. All right a chair is not an animal. Well, okay. What about a chair that is Well, okay. What about a chair that is Well, okay. What about a chair that is for a child and it's in the shape of, for a child and it's in the shape of, for a child and it's in the shape of, you know, it's in the shape of a a you know, it's in the shape of a a you know, it's in the shape of a a dinosaur or a kangaroo or something like dinosaur or a kangaroo or something like dinosaur or a kangaroo or something like that? So, then you get into these weird that? So, then you get into these weird that? So, then you get into these weird kind of philosophical questions of like, kind of philosophical questions of like, kind of philosophical questions of like, well, is a chair most like a platypus well, is a chair most like a platypus well, is a chair most like a platypus with four legs and zero arms or is it with four legs and zero arms or is it with four legs and zero arms or is it more like a centaur with four legs and more like a centaur with four legs and more like a centaur with four legs and two arms? And who really gets to decide two arms? And who really gets to decide two arms? And who really gets to decide this and what this organizational scheme this and what this organizational scheme this and what this organizational scheme should do? should do? should do? And that's where a lot of public And that's where a lot of public And that's where a lot of public discussion comes into play. Um, and then discussion comes into play. Um, and then discussion comes into play. Um, and then separately, what are the implications separately, what are the implications separately, what are the implications for mapping? We might hear, oh, I I have for mapping? We might hear, oh, I I have for mapping? We might hear, oh, I I have a report about a new animal. It's got a report about a new animal. It's got a report about a new animal. It's got two arms. Well, how many legs does it two arms. Well, how many legs does it two arms. Well, how many legs does it have? I don't know. Well, then we can't have? I don't know. Well, then we can't have? I don't know. Well, then we can't classify it in the current hierarchy. classify it in the current hierarchy. classify it in the current hierarchy. This is an instance of not having real This is an instance of not having real This is an instance of not having real sufficient information to be able to sufficient information to be able to sufficient information to be able to classify something appropriately even classify something appropriately even classify something appropriately even with something some kind of a simplistic with something some kind of a simplistic with something some kind of a simplistic hierarchy such as this. Now, you know, hierarchy such as this. Now, you know, hierarchy such as this. Now, you know, you might be saying, what does this have you might be saying, what does this have you might be saying, what does this have to do with CWE? Well, it, you know, I to do with CWE? Well, it, you know, I to do with CWE? Well, it, you know, I hope it's pretty clear. We have four hope it's pretty clear. We have four hope it's pretty clear. We have four levels of abstraction with pillars all levels of abstraction with pillars all levels of abstraction with pillars all the way down to variance. We have the way down to variance. We have the way down to variance. We have different parts of the tree that break different parts of the tree that break different parts of the tree that break along different facets or dimensions along different facets or dimensions along different facets or dimensions such as the behavior, technology, such as the behavior, technology, such as the behavior, technology, resource, and so on. And so, when we get resource, and so on. And so, when we get resource, and so on. And so, when we get proposals that sort of cross multiple proposals that sort of cross multiple proposals that sort of cross multiple dimensions, it's not entirely sure what dimensions, it's not entirely sure what dimensions, it's not entirely sure what we can do to address that. And we've had we can do to address that. And we've had we can do to address that. And we've had many opportunities to introduce overlap, many opportunities to introduce overlap, many opportunities to introduce overlap, but we've been minimizing that in real but we've been minimizing that in real but we've been minimizing that in real life. But what that sometimes means life. But what that sometimes means life. But what that sometimes means means is holding back on things and means is holding back on things and means is holding back on things and trying to figure out where they fit. And trying to figure out where they fit. And trying to figure out where they fit. And at least for future of 5.0 of CW 5.0, I at least for future of 5.0 of CW 5.0, I at least for future of 5.0 of CW 5.0, I would like to at least be able to would like to at least be able to would like to at least be able to formalize or specify what some of these formalize or specify what some of these formalize or specify what some of these dimensions dimensions dimensions are. Some people might feel helpful and are. Some people might feel helpful and are. Some people might feel helpful and say, "Hey, just use an ontology." say, "Hey, just use an ontology." say, "Hey, just use an ontology." understandable but we have a flat ID understandable but we have a flat ID understandable but we have a flat ID name space for reasons um so we can't name space for reasons um so we can't name space for reasons um so we can't necessarily do that necessarily do that necessarily do that immediately so for my conclusion uh CWE immediately so for my conclusion uh CWE immediately so for my conclusion uh CWE has grown very much since the initial uh has grown very much since the initial uh has grown very much since the initial uh kitchen sync way back when in 2005 2006 kitchen sync way back when in 2005 2006 kitchen sync way back when in 2005 2006 uh it still needs to grow both in uh it still needs to grow both in uh it still needs to grow both in breadth and depth and usability and you breadth and depth and usability and you breadth and depth and usability and you all in the community can help uh you can all in the community can help uh you can all in the community can help uh you can help us by providing feedback and you help us by providing feedback and you help us by providing feedback and you can help us by submitting new content can help us by submitting new content can help us by submitting new content And with that, I'm open for questions if And with that, I'm open for questions if And with that, I'm open for questions if we have time for any questions. Um, we have time for any questions. Um, we have time for any questions. Um, thank you very much for your attention. thank you very much for your attention. thank you very much for your attention. I'll give it back to you all. We make questions in the room. Some questions from Discord. room. Some questions from Discord. room. Some questions from Discord. So first question is how well does CW So first question is how well does CW So first question is how well does CW work for a kill chain of weaknesses that work for a kill chain of weaknesses that work for a kill chain of weaknesses that might be assigned one CVE? Um so Um so Um so uh one CVE one one thing that's uh one CVE one one thing that's uh one CVE one one thing that's important for people to understand is important for people to understand is important for people to understand is for some for some for some vulnerabilities vulnerabilities might vulnerabilities vulnerabilities might vulnerabilities vulnerabilities might involve chains of multiple weaknesses um involve chains of multiple weaknesses um involve chains of multiple weaknesses um or combinations of multiple or combinations of multiple or combinations of multiple weaknesses. Um and so some CVEes by weaknesses. Um and so some CVEes by weaknesses. Um and so some CVEes by necessity would need to be captured by necessity would need to be captured by necessity would need to be captured by multiple CWEs by by multiple chains. So multiple CWEs by by multiple chains. So multiple CWEs by by multiple chains. So when you're talking about things like um when you're talking about things like um when you're talking about things like um kill chains, uh I'm not an expert in kill chains, uh I'm not an expert in kill chains, uh I'm not an expert in that that that department. department. department. Um but it it is a different way of Um but it it is a different way of Um but it it is a different way of thinking. It's not necessarily a a pure thinking. It's not necessarily a a pure thinking. It's not necessarily a a pure weakness way of thinking, but it isn't weakness way of thinking, but it isn't weakness way of thinking, but it isn't it is important to recognize that even it is important to recognize that even it is important to recognize that even an individual vulnerability could an individual vulnerability could an individual vulnerability could consist of multiple weaknesses. So there consist of multiple weaknesses. So there consist of multiple weaknesses. So there are lots of individual are lots of individual are lots of individual CVE that consist of multiple weaknesses, CVE that consist of multiple weaknesses, CVE that consist of multiple weaknesses, all of them closely related. So if you all of them closely related. So if you all of them closely related. So if you get into certain kinds of you know get into certain kinds of you know get into certain kinds of you know threat analysis or attack analysis that threat analysis or attack analysis that threat analysis or attack analysis that involves exploitation of multiple CVEes involves exploitation of multiple CVEes involves exploitation of multiple CVEes um you could be covering any different um you could be covering any different um you could be covering any different range of uh CWES as inherited from range of uh CWES as inherited from range of uh CWES as inherited from multiple multiple multiple CVE. Um I hope that gave something of an CVE. Um I hope that gave something of an CVE. Um I hope that gave something of an answer and I apologize again I'm not a answer and I apologize again I'm not a answer and I apologize again I'm not a I'm not a killchain expert. I'm not a killchain expert. I'm not a killchain expert. We got another one from Discord. Um, is We got another one from Discord. Um, is We got another one from Discord. Um, is there a future where all CVEEs are input there a future where all CVEEs are input there a future where all CVEEs are input into an AI solution that would into an AI solution that would into an AI solution that would recategorize CWEs to reduce the recategorize CWEs to reduce the recategorize CWEs to reduce the complexity of understanding all the complexity of understanding all the complexity of understanding all the nuances that have built up over the nuances that have built up over the nuances that have built up over the years of CW evolving? years of CW evolving? years of CW evolving? Um, there's been quite a bit of work Um, there's been quite a bit of work Um, there's been quite a bit of work that's gone on. Um, Alex Summers and that's gone on. Um, Alex Summers and that's gone on. Um, Alex Summers and Chris Madden gave a presentation on the Chris Madden gave a presentation on the Chris Madden gave a presentation on the use of LLMs to help with that space um, use of LLMs to help with that space um, use of LLMs to help with that space um, back on Monday. I think there have been back on Monday. I think there have been back on Monday. I think there have been some other topics um on the subject as some other topics um on the subject as some other topics um on the subject as well. Um but use of unconstrained AI well. Um but use of unconstrained AI well. Um but use of unconstrained AI being trained on bad data um I don't being trained on bad data um I don't being trained on bad data um I don't need to tell everyone the potential need to tell everyone the potential need to tell everyone the potential risks in that. So um we need to be uh risks in that. So um we need to be uh risks in that. So um we need to be uh careful about how we do that. And also careful about how we do that. And also careful about how we do that. And also in multiple slides in my presentation in multiple slides in my presentation in multiple slides in my presentation here I talked about how there's problems here I talked about how there's problems here I talked about how there's problems in terminology or problems in you know in terminology or problems in you know in terminology or problems in you know how vulnerabilities or how weaknesses how vulnerabilities or how weaknesses how vulnerabilities or how weaknesses are being described and you have some are being described and you have some are being described and you have some cases with you know let's say vendors cases with you know let's say vendors cases with you know let's say vendors that don't even want to identify what that don't even want to identify what that don't even want to identify what the weakness is uh because of their own the weakness is uh because of their own the weakness is uh because of their own you know risk aversion to public you know risk aversion to public you know risk aversion to public publicizing certain kinds of details. So publicizing certain kinds of details. So publicizing certain kinds of details. So while there's um there's a bit of while there's um there's a bit of while there's um there's a bit of potential for AI to you know to be used potential for AI to you know to be used potential for AI to you know to be used to go and characterize all the different to go and characterize all the different to go and characterize all the different CVEes that are out there um and there CVEes that are out there um and there CVEes that are out there um and there has been some work in that area. Um I has been some work in that area. Um I has been some work in that area. Um I advise I advise caution. There is advise I advise caution. There is advise I advise caution. There is potential but we need to be uh careful potential but we need to be uh careful potential but we need to be uh careful not to throw out the baby with the not to throw out the baby with the not to throw out the baby with the bathwater as it were. If CW gets rearchitectured, would it be If CW gets rearchitectured, would it be If CW gets rearchitectured, would it be V2 so that old or existing CVE that V2 so that old or existing CVE that V2 so that old or existing CVE that already have an associated CWE wouldn't already have an associated CWE wouldn't already have an associated CWE wouldn't need to be immediately updated to CWE need to be immediately updated to CWE need to be immediately updated to CWE v2? Um, uh, that's a good question. C.WE has not uh, that's a good question. C.WE has not uh, that's a good question. C.WE has not gone through any kind of major overhaul gone through any kind of major overhaul gone through any kind of major overhaul like CVE has. CVE has gone through and I like CVE has. CVE has gone through and I like CVE has. CVE has gone through and I I don't know what the CVE team says but I don't know what the CVE team says but I don't know what the CVE team says but to me CVE has gone through three major to me CVE has gone through three major to me CVE has gone through three major uh generations at the very least. Um but uh generations at the very least. Um but uh generations at the very least. Um but for CWE if we make any major changes we for CWE if we make any major changes we for CWE if we make any major changes we do need to be mindful of you know how to do need to be mindful of you know how to do need to be mindful of you know how to make sure those changes where possible make sure those changes where possible make sure those changes where possible are going to be forward compatible and are going to be forward compatible and are going to be forward compatible and that really should not be done without that really should not be done without that really should not be done without careful planning and lots of um careful planning and lots of um careful planning and lots of um collaboration with the varying collaboration with the varying collaboration with the varying communities that have interest in CWE as communities that have interest in CWE as communities that have interest in CWE as well. So um and that's not something well. So um and that's not something well. So um and that's not something that's going to happen overnight. So we that's going to happen overnight. So we that's going to happen overnight. So we would be uh ideally I hope cautious and would be uh ideally I hope cautious and would be uh ideally I hope cautious and take our time in implementing things the take our time in implementing things the take our time in implementing things the right way. Um hopefully it's uh and and right way. Um hopefully it's uh and and right way. Um hopefully it's uh and and we've seen this in some cases like with we've seen this in some cases like with we've seen this in some cases like with CVSS version transitions, right? CVSS version transitions, right? CVSS version transitions, right? Transitions from CVSS version one to Transitions from CVSS version one to Transitions from CVSS version one to version two and then two to version version two and then two to version version two and then two to version three. You always lose something a three. You always lose something a three. You always lose something a little bit in the translation or you little bit in the translation or you little bit in the translation or you have to make some kinds of have to make some kinds of have to make some kinds of approximations. you know, ultimately approximations. you know, ultimately approximations. you know, ultimately that may need to be done when it comes that may need to be done when it comes that may need to be done when it comes to usage of C.WE, but you know, again, to usage of C.WE, but you know, again, to usage of C.WE, but you know, again, that's not happening uh that's not that's not happening uh that's not that's not happening uh that's not happening anytime soon. Hey, Steve, I understand CW is very Hey, Steve, I understand CW is very Hey, Steve, I understand CW is very helpful internally to prevent future helpful internally to prevent future helpful internally to prevent future weaknesses. I have a problem convincing weaknesses. I have a problem convincing weaknesses. I have a problem convincing product teams to publicly map to a more product teams to publicly map to a more product teams to publicly map to a more appropriate weakness rather than a appropriate weakness rather than a appropriate weakness rather than a pillar that may be discouraged. What pillar that may be discouraged. What pillar that may be discouraged. What would you tell a development team? would you tell a development team? would you tell a development team? Um, we have a lot of guidance in the Um, we have a lot of guidance in the Um, we have a lot of guidance in the individual mapping notes for individual individual mapping notes for individual individual mapping notes for individual weaknesses. And one of the points that weaknesses. And one of the points that weaknesses. And one of the points that we um that we make pretty repetitively we um that we make pretty repetitively we um that we make pretty repetitively um for in in individual entries, but um for in in individual entries, but um for in in individual entries, but also I think it's in our guidance also I think it's in our guidance also I think it's in our guidance documents uh is do not try and force a documents uh is do not try and force a documents uh is do not try and force a mapping to a lower level C.WE just mapping to a lower level C.WE just mapping to a lower level C.WE just because it's kind of close. And so because it's kind of close. And so because it's kind of close. And so sometimes you're you're forced to use a sometimes you're you're forced to use a sometimes you're you're forced to use a higher level C.WE we such as a class or higher level C.WE we such as a class or higher level C.WE we such as a class or maybe even a pillar. What that indicates maybe even a pillar. What that indicates maybe even a pillar. What that indicates is potential gaps in C.WE. It might also is potential gaps in C.WE. It might also is potential gaps in C.WE. It might also indicate that maybe the person doing the indicate that maybe the person doing the indicate that maybe the person doing the mapping hasn't studied, you know, the mapping hasn't studied, you know, the mapping hasn't studied, you know, the root cause to the appropriate level of root cause to the appropriate level of root cause to the appropriate level of detail to really understand the issue. detail to really understand the issue. detail to really understand the issue. Um, but if you're being knowledgeable Um, but if you're being knowledgeable Um, but if you're being knowledgeable and you're making your you're doing your and you're making your you're doing your and you're making your you're doing your best attempt, um, you want to use best attempt, um, you want to use best attempt, um, you want to use whatever the lowest level C.WE we that's whatever the lowest level C.WE we that's whatever the lowest level C.WE we that's available and unfortunately we recognize available and unfortunately we recognize available and unfortunately we recognize that's sometimes going to be a high that's sometimes going to be a high that's sometimes going to be a high level class or high level pillar. The level class or high level pillar. The level class or high level pillar. The more that we can grow CWE and fill in more that we can grow CWE and fill in more that we can grow CWE and fill in some of these gaps in the coming years some of these gaps in the coming years some of these gaps in the coming years um the less uh you know the less um the less uh you know the less um the less uh you know the less frequently that kind of challenge will frequently that kind of challenge will frequently that kind of challenge will show up hopefully. Uh we got one more. Uh has CW looked at Uh we got one more. Uh has CW looked at Uh we got one more. Uh has CW looked at the NIST volunttologology as a means for the NIST volunttologology as a means for the NIST volunttologology as a means for classification uses? uses? uses? Um I'm not deeply familiar with the uh Um I'm not deeply familiar with the uh Um I'm not deeply familiar with the uh volunttology but I am pretty familiar volunttology but I am pretty familiar volunttology but I am pretty familiar with the NIST bugs framework. Um and uh with the NIST bugs framework. Um and uh with the NIST bugs framework. Um and uh there is a lot of good work in the in there is a lot of good work in the in there is a lot of good work in the in the NIST bugs framework. Um but that the NIST bugs framework. Um but that the NIST bugs framework. Um but that framework I would say is is um a bit framework I would say is is um a bit framework I would say is is um a bit more academic. Um uh you know they have more academic. Um uh you know they have more academic. Um uh you know they have to create their own terminology in some to create their own terminology in some to create their own terminology in some cases. There's not a onetoone cases. There's not a onetoone cases. There's not a onetoone relationship between the NIST bugs relationship between the NIST bugs relationship between the NIST bugs framework and C.WE. Um and I think there framework and C.WE. Um and I think there framework and C.WE. Um and I think there are some assumptions that exist under are some assumptions that exist under are some assumptions that exist under the bugs framework of having access you the bugs framework of having access you the bugs framework of having access you know complete access to complete know complete access to complete know complete access to complete information so that you can then information so that you can then information so that you can then unambiguously classify something. um you unambiguously classify something. um you unambiguously classify something. um you know we we have some of that same kind know we we have some of that same kind know we we have some of that same kind of problem as well. Um of problem as well. Um of problem as well. Um uh but um I'd love to follow up with you uh but um I'd love to follow up with you uh but um I'd love to follow up with you or I can follow up with others on the or I can follow up with others on the or I can follow up with others on the other voltology work the stack all the way back to the work the stack all the way back to the work the stack all the way back to the spirit and intent of CW. Why do we spirit and intent of CW. Why do we spirit and intent of CW. Why do we assign CWE IDs? I would assume it's to assign CWE IDs? I would assume it's to assign CWE IDs? I would assume it's to statistically analyze common bad statistically analyze common bad statistically analyze common bad behavior among other categorical things. behavior among other categorical things. behavior among other categorical things. At the two ends of the spectrum, one CW At the two ends of the spectrum, one CW At the two ends of the spectrum, one CW has no granular has no granular has no granular granularity. Uh almost two to 16 CWs granularity. Uh almost two to 16 CWs granularity. Uh almost two to 16 CWs makes grouping impossible or makes grouping impossible or makes grouping impossible or meaningless? Is fewer better than from a meaningless? Is fewer better than from a meaningless? Is fewer better than from a statistical analysis perspective or are statistical analysis perspective or are statistical analysis perspective or are more C specific CWS useful in some way? So um from the perspective of you know So um from the perspective of you know So um from the perspective of you know mapping vulnerabilities to their root mapping vulnerabilities to their root mapping vulnerabilities to their root cause weaknesses that's our you know cause weaknesses that's our you know cause weaknesses that's our you know maybe our primary use case but it's not maybe our primary use case but it's not maybe our primary use case but it's not the only use case for CWE but the only use case for CWE but the only use case for CWE but considering considering mapping what we considering considering mapping what we considering considering mapping what we want people to do and what we need to be want people to do and what we need to be want people to do and what we need to be able to support ourselves is helping able to support ourselves is helping able to support ourselves is helping people to map to you know base level and people to map to you know base level and people to map to you know base level and variant level CWES and that does mean in variant level CWES and that does mean in variant level CWES and that does mean in some cases closing some cases closing some cases closing uh classification gaps. Um and part of uh classification gaps. Um and part of uh classification gaps. Um and part of part of this part of this part of this uh you know trend analysis and uh you know trend analysis and uh you know trend analysis and understanding you know on a large scale understanding you know on a large scale understanding you know on a large scale um you know where uh certain weaknesses um you know where uh certain weaknesses um you know where uh certain weaknesses lie. that is a a major use case whether lie. that is a a major use case whether lie. that is a a major use case whether you're whether you're a vendor who's you're whether you're a vendor who's you're whether you're a vendor who's responsible for a lot of different responsible for a lot of different responsible for a lot of different products and managing a lot of different products and managing a lot of different products and managing a lot of different vulnerabilities and you want to get your vulnerabilities and you want to get your vulnerabilities and you want to get your you know your own developer teams uh you know your own developer teams uh you know your own developer teams uh better or you know figure out which better or you know figure out which better or you know figure out which tooling you need to integrate whether tooling you need to integrate whether tooling you need to integrate whether you're a developer like that or whether you're a developer like that or whether you're a developer like that or whether you're you know um let's say a you're you know um let's say a you're you know um let's say a government organization who's trying to government organization who's trying to government organization who's trying to manage large-scale vulnerabilities manage large-scale vulnerabilities manage large-scale vulnerabilities across an entire industry this kind of across an entire industry this kind of across an entire industry this kind of trend analysis is important um and the trend analysis is important um and the trend analysis is important um and the vari ations that exist um in how data is vari ations that exist um in how data is vari ations that exist um in how data is captured and how it's recorded. Uh that captured and how it's recorded. Uh that captured and how it's recorded. Uh that is a problem that is a problem area. Um is a problem that is a problem area. Um is a problem that is a problem area. Um we're sort of in a transition at this we're sort of in a transition at this we're sort of in a transition at this point of you know view 10003 which is point of you know view 10003 which is point of you know view 10003 which is used by NVD only has 130 CWES in it. We used by NVD only has 130 CWES in it. We used by NVD only has 130 CWES in it. We want people to be able to use pretty want people to be able to use pretty want people to be able to use pretty much all CWEs. Um and this does has much all CWEs. Um and this does has much all CWEs. Um and this does has implications for doing trend analysis implications for doing trend analysis implications for doing trend analysis and comparisons. Um, but we're not just and comparisons. Um, but we're not just and comparisons. Um, but we're not just we're not just fully there yet. And I we're not just fully there yet. And I we're not just fully there yet. And I would say neither is the industry. When would say neither is the industry. When would say neither is the industry. When you still have huge numbers of people you still have huge numbers of people you still have huge numbers of people who are just mapping to CWE20 and proper who are just mapping to CWE20 and proper who are just mapping to CWE20 and proper input validation, um, there's only so input validation, um, there's only so input validation, um, there's only so much we can resolve these problems much we can resolve these problems much we can resolve these problems ourselves. But we can at least position ourselves. But we can at least position ourselves. But we can at least position ourselves better in the coming years by ourselves better in the coming years by ourselves better in the coming years by making sure that C.WE is more um, making sure that C.WE is more um, making sure that C.WE is more um, comprehensive, especially at these lower comprehensive, especially at these lower comprehensive, especially at these lower levels of abstraction that are more levels of abstraction that are more levels of abstraction that are more practical and fundamental such as bases practical and fundamental such as bases practical and fundamental such as bases and variance.
