Um kind of you know going you will. Um kind of you know going you will. Um kind of you know going about 3 years now um into my ESBOM about 3 years now um into my ESBOM about 3 years now um into my ESBOM journey and I'm absolutely excited about journey and I'm absolutely excited about journey and I'm absolutely excited about seeing the progress of taking this seeing the progress of taking this seeing the progress of taking this really theoretical concept that we've really theoretical concept that we've really theoretical concept that we've now turned into real world applications now turned into real world applications now turned into real world applications and I want to kind of talk through and I want to kind of talk through and I want to kind of talk through three. Um I think one of them um most of three. Um I think one of them um most of three. Um I think one of them um most of you all will be familiar with that's you all will be familiar with that's you all will be familiar with that's kind of the bread and butter on the kind of the bread and butter on the kind of the bread and butter on the generation and distribution um use case generation and distribution um use case generation and distribution um use case and there's two other ones that and there's two other ones that and there's two other ones that hopefully will a bit newer to you and hopefully will a bit newer to you and hopefully will a bit newer to you and you kind of take um some things away. Uh you kind of take um some things away. Uh you kind of take um some things away. Uh kind of before I jump in at this point kind of before I jump in at this point kind of before I jump in at this point in time I think we should probably be in in time I think we should probably be in in time I think we should probably be in a good space but I just want to see how a good space but I just want to see how a good space but I just want to see how much introductory information I need to much introductory information I need to much introductory information I need to provide today. Just show of hands how provide today. Just show of hands how provide today. Just show of hands how many people have heard of an ESBOM at many people have heard of an ESBOM at many people have heard of an ESBOM at this point in time? Fantastic. Everybody this point in time? Fantastic. Everybody this point in time? Fantastic. Everybody in the room that's what I like to see. in the room that's what I like to see. in the room that's what I like to see. Uh two years ago that was not the case. Uh two years ago that was not the case. Uh two years ago that was not the case. So, we're making progress. Um, what So, we're making progress. Um, what So, we're making progress. Um, what about concepts like uh VEX, about concepts like uh VEX, about concepts like uh VEX, vulnerability exploitability exchange vulnerability exploitability exchange vulnerability exploitability exchange and BDR, vulnerability disclosure and BDR, vulnerability disclosure and BDR, vulnerability disclosure report? We familiar with these things. report? We familiar with these things. report? We familiar with these things. Excellent. Fantastic. Um, and then what Excellent. Fantastic. Um, and then what Excellent. Fantastic. Um, and then what about some concepts around like package about some concepts around like package about some concepts around like package URL? Um, CPE, omnibore ID. We've heard URL? Um, CPE, omnibore ID. We've heard URL? Um, CPE, omnibore ID. We've heard of some of these things. Okay, cool. So, of some of these things. Okay, cool. So, of some of these things. Okay, cool. So, that one's a little bit more mixed. I that one's a little bit more mixed. I that one's a little bit more mixed. I I'll spend a little bit of time there. I'll spend a little bit of time there. I'll spend a little bit of time there. Um, but it seems like we all have a Um, but it seems like we all have a Um, but it seems like we all have a decent basic understanding. I'll decent basic understanding. I'll decent basic understanding. I'll probably go through um the kind of like probably go through um the kind of like probably go through um the kind of like ESBOM landscape pretty quickly then. And ESBOM landscape pretty quickly then. And ESBOM landscape pretty quickly then. And it seems like we have some decent Xbomb it seems like we have some decent Xbomb it seems like we have some decent Xbomb experts in the audience which I'm experts in the audience which I'm experts in the audience which I'm excited about. Um and then try to spend excited about. Um and then try to spend excited about. Um and then try to spend the vast majority of my time on those the vast majority of my time on those the vast majority of my time on those three individual scenarios, some three individual scenarios, some three individual scenarios, some challenges that I think each one will challenges that I think each one will challenges that I think each one will experience and then ideal workflow um experience and then ideal workflow um experience and then ideal workflow um based on my experience with various customers. Okay, perfect. First and customers. Okay, perfect. First and customers. Okay, perfect. First and foremost, um let's kind of walk through foremost, um let's kind of walk through foremost, um let's kind of walk through uh the ESBOM landscape. Um as most uh the ESBOM landscape. Um as most uh the ESBOM landscape. Um as most things um in life, we are not all just things um in life, we are not all just things um in life, we are not all just excited to open up our doors and tell excited to open up our doors and tell excited to open up our doors and tell everyone who will listen. um what our everyone who will listen. um what our everyone who will listen. um what our package ecosystem looks like. This is package ecosystem looks like. This is package ecosystem looks like. This is often times driven by outside often times driven by outside often times driven by outside influences. Um in our case, uh that's influences. Um in our case, uh that's influences. Um in our case, uh that's going to be regulatory environments. Um going to be regulatory environments. Um going to be regulatory environments. Um many of you, I'm sure, remember um I many of you, I'm sure, remember um I many of you, I'm sure, remember um I think Solar Winds really kind of kicked think Solar Winds really kind of kicked think Solar Winds really kind of kicked it off way back when with that software it off way back when with that software it off way back when with that software supply chain attack. We all decided, you supply chain attack. We all decided, you supply chain attack. We all decided, you know what, we cannot continue to operate know what, we cannot continue to operate know what, we cannot continue to operate in darkness as it pertains to what are in darkness as it pertains to what are in darkness as it pertains to what are um what other people within our supply um what other people within our supply um what other people within our supply chain are bringing in to our software chain are bringing in to our software chain are bringing in to our software organizations. Um something that a lot organizations. Um something that a lot organizations. Um something that a lot of people don't remember is that the uh of people don't remember is that the uh of people don't remember is that the uh solar winds attack actually happened to solar winds attack actually happened to solar winds attack actually happened to a developer environment and so often a developer environment and so often a developer environment and so often times we put so much emphasis on purely times we put so much emphasis on purely times we put so much emphasis on purely production code that we forget that production code that we forget that production code that we forget that there's really many many attack surfaces there's really many many attack surfaces there's really many many attack surfaces that you have to be mindful of and make that you have to be mindful of and make that you have to be mindful of and make sure that you are tracking. Um in the sure that you are tracking. Um in the sure that you are tracking. Um in the last 12 to 18 months the sbomb last 12 to 18 months the sbomb last 12 to 18 months the sbomb regulation has been absolutely heating regulation has been absolutely heating regulation has been absolutely heating up. Um I've heard nothing but like CRA up. Um I've heard nothing but like CRA up. Um I've heard nothing but like CRA all over the conference this week which all over the conference this week which all over the conference this week which has been fantastic. So, it seems like a has been fantastic. So, it seems like a has been fantastic. So, it seems like a lot of people are at least hearing a lot lot of people are at least hearing a lot lot of people are at least hearing a lot of this, starting to deal with a lot of of this, starting to deal with a lot of of this, starting to deal with a lot of this and want to uh pass it down. Um, if this and want to uh pass it down. Um, if this and want to uh pass it down. Um, if you do anything on the finance side, PCI you do anything on the finance side, PCI you do anything on the finance side, PCI 4.0 DSS. Um, interesting because uh what 4.0 DSS. Um, interesting because uh what 4.0 DSS. Um, interesting because uh what you'll see commonly in the regulation is you'll see commonly in the regulation is you'll see commonly in the regulation is they tend to shy away from using the they tend to shy away from using the they tend to shy away from using the term ESBOM directly. They'll use term ESBOM directly. They'll use term ESBOM directly. They'll use offiscated words like a inventory of offiscated words like a inventory of offiscated words like a inventory of bespoke assets u which we will bespoke assets u which we will bespoke assets u which we will colloqually call an esbomb moving colloqually call an esbomb moving colloqually call an esbomb moving forward. forward. forward. Um the uh FDA requirements um as well Um the uh FDA requirements um as well Um the uh FDA requirements um as well have been really interesting. In have been really interesting. In have been really interesting. In particular, anyone on the medical device particular, anyone on the medical device particular, anyone on the medical device manufacturer space who has to do manufacturer space who has to do manufacturer space who has to do pre-market submissions, postmarket pre-market submissions, postmarket pre-market submissions, postmarket submissions, 501ks and all that kind of submissions, 501ks and all that kind of submissions, 501ks and all that kind of good stuff. Um and then the automotive good stuff. Um and then the automotive good stuff. Um and then the automotive um industry is actually seeing a lot of um industry is actually seeing a lot of um industry is actually seeing a lot of attraction as of late. Um UNR 155 um was attraction as of late. Um UNR 155 um was attraction as of late. Um UNR 155 um was a big one. Um and once again does not a big one. Um and once again does not a big one. Um and once again does not call out esbombs explicitly but it call out esbombs explicitly but it call out esbombs explicitly but it continues to call out this inventory of continues to call out this inventory of continues to call out this inventory of bespoke assets just the greatest vehicle bespoke assets just the greatest vehicle bespoke assets just the greatest vehicle for you to be able to communicate um for you to be able to communicate um for you to be able to communicate um some of these things. Um we have a lot some of these things. Um we have a lot some of these things. Um we have a lot of customers in the automotive space. of customers in the automotive space. of customers in the automotive space. We're seeing a lot of their tier one We're seeing a lot of their tier one We're seeing a lot of their tier one tier 2 suppliers now being required to tier 2 suppliers now being required to tier 2 suppliers now being required to provide them um sbombs and I will talk provide them um sbombs and I will talk provide them um sbombs and I will talk through that scenario here um a bit through that scenario here um a bit through that scenario here um a bit more. Um we all know what sbombs are so more. Um we all know what sbombs are so more. Um we all know what sbombs are so I'm not going to spend a ton of time I'm not going to spend a ton of time I'm not going to spend a ton of time here. You got SPDX and Cyclone DX. Those here. You got SPDX and Cyclone DX. Those here. You got SPDX and Cyclone DX. Those are the big standards. I have a are the big standards. I have a are the big standards. I have a preference cyclone DX. told you it's I preference cyclone DX. told you it's I preference cyclone DX. told you it's I have strong opinions here. Um but if have strong opinions here. Um but if have strong opinions here. Um but if you're using SPDX, I have no qualms you're using SPDX, I have no qualms you're using SPDX, I have no qualms against that. There's lots of reasons against that. There's lots of reasons against that. There's lots of reasons why I think Cyclone DX is the better why I think Cyclone DX is the better why I think Cyclone DX is the better standard and you're wrong. Um but that's okay and I I will be happy to debate okay and I I will be happy to debate okay and I I will be happy to debate that um with you whenever you're ready. that um with you whenever you're ready. that um with you whenever you're ready. Um just kind of if you've never seen an Um just kind of if you've never seen an Um just kind of if you've never seen an Esbomb before, most people have. This Esbomb before, most people have. This Esbomb before, most people have. This what it kind of looks like. Um at the what it kind of looks like. Um at the what it kind of looks like. Um at the end of the day, an ESBOM could be an end of the day, an ESBOM could be an end of the day, an ESBOM could be an Excel sheet if you really wanted it to. Excel sheet if you really wanted it to. Excel sheet if you really wanted it to. You should use JSON. Um but you can use You should use JSON. Um but you can use You should use JSON. Um but you can use any format that you desire. any format that you desire. any format that you desire. Um, I'll spend a little bit of time on Um, I'll spend a little bit of time on Um, I'll spend a little bit of time on VEX and VDR. Oftentimes, people confuse VEX and VDR. Oftentimes, people confuse VEX and VDR. Oftentimes, people confuse the vulnerability disclosure report as a the vulnerability disclosure report as a the vulnerability disclosure report as a VEX statement in and of itself. And VEX statement in and of itself. And VEX statement in and of itself. And these are actually two separate things. these are actually two separate things. these are actually two separate things. One of them is how do I disclose what One of them is how do I disclose what One of them is how do I disclose what vulnerabilities actually exist in my vulnerabilities actually exist in my vulnerabilities actually exist in my particular ASBOM. The second is then how particular ASBOM. The second is then how particular ASBOM. The second is then how do I make an assertion on the do I make an assertion on the do I make an assertion on the exploitability or if I'm impacted or exploitability or if I'm impacted or exploitability or if I'm impacted or affected by that particular affected by that particular affected by that particular vulnerability. And so that first being vulnerability. And so that first being vulnerability. And so that first being the VDR, show me everything that you the VDR, show me everything that you the VDR, show me everything that you have. The next being a VEX, tell me what have. The next being a VEX, tell me what have. The next being a VEX, tell me what your status is. Um there's a lot of your status is. Um there's a lot of your status is. Um there's a lot of unclear questions that I think we still unclear questions that I think we still unclear questions that I think we still need to um answer as an industry on what need to um answer as an industry on what need to um answer as an industry on what VEX should truly be, right? Is this a VEX should truly be, right? Is this a VEX should truly be, right? Is this a historical historical historical um neverending um report of every single um neverending um report of every single um neverending um report of every single time you release a new version, you now time you release a new version, you now time you release a new version, you now have to make sure that you audit log any have to make sure that you audit log any have to make sure that you audit log any vulnerability that at one point in time vulnerability that at one point in time vulnerability that at one point in time has ever impacted your codebase. Is it has ever impacted your codebase. Is it has ever impacted your codebase. Is it supposed to be a snapshot of that supposed to be a snapshot of that supposed to be a snapshot of that particular point in time of only the particular point in time of only the particular point in time of only the vulnerabilities that are currently vulnerabilities that are currently vulnerabilities that are currently impacting and their assertion on that impacting and their assertion on that impacting and their assertion on that status? I think that's a valid open status? I think that's a valid open status? I think that's a valid open question. I don't think anybody has a question. I don't think anybody has a question. I don't think anybody has a great answer for it yet. Once again, I great answer for it yet. Once again, I great answer for it yet. Once again, I have strong opinions. I think you should have strong opinions. I think you should have strong opinions. I think you should make the historical audit trail make the historical audit trail make the historical audit trail approach. I think it's better for approach. I think it's better for approach. I think it's better for completeness and more importantly allows completeness and more importantly allows completeness and more importantly allows for you to get ahead of anyone who is for you to get ahead of anyone who is for you to get ahead of anyone who is consuming your sbomb, which is the consuming your sbomb, which is the consuming your sbomb, which is the primary value proposition of something primary value proposition of something primary value proposition of something like a VEX or BDR statement, which is I like a VEX or BDR statement, which is I like a VEX or BDR statement, which is I do not want to get harassed by my do not want to get harassed by my do not want to get harassed by my customers and so I will preemptively customers and so I will preemptively customers and so I will preemptively give them some information. So that way give them some information. So that way give them some information. So that way when they import that into any, you when they import that into any, you when they import that into any, you know, tool, dependency track, faucet, know, tool, dependency track, faucet, know, tool, dependency track, faucet, whatever it has, they're going to see a whatever it has, they're going to see a whatever it has, they're going to see a thousand vulnerabilities and they're thousand vulnerabilities and they're thousand vulnerabilities and they're going to say, "Oh my god, your code is going to say, "Oh my god, your code is going to say, "Oh my god, your code is absolutely horrible. What's happening absolutely horrible. What's happening absolutely horrible. What's happening here?" And this allows for you to get here?" And this allows for you to get here?" And this allows for you to get ahead of that ahead of that ahead of that conversation. Um, a little bit on the conversation. Um, a little bit on the conversation. Um, a little bit on the VDR side, what that looks like. VDR side, what that looks like. VDR side, what that looks like. Oftentimes, people call VEX, and I Oftentimes, people call VEX, and I Oftentimes, people call VEX, and I apologize, I know the gradient's apologize, I know the gradient's apologize, I know the gradient's probably not the easiest for you to see. probably not the easiest for you to see. probably not the easiest for you to see. um VDR naming things like the severity um VDR naming things like the severity um VDR naming things like the severity uh references, what's the CVSS score is, uh references, what's the CVSS score is, uh references, what's the CVSS score is, what the attack vectors are. That is all what the attack vectors are. That is all what the attack vectors are. That is all purely on the disclosure side. VEX is purely on the disclosure side. VEX is purely on the disclosure side. VEX is this really, really, really tiny this really, really, really tiny this really, really, really tiny statement. Um, and I'm oversimplifying statement. Um, and I'm oversimplifying statement. Um, and I'm oversimplifying here. There's multiple VEX formats. This here. There's multiple VEX formats. This here. There's multiple VEX formats. This one is specifically embedded within one is specifically embedded within one is specifically embedded within Cyclone DX. You've probably seen VEX in Cyclone DX. You've probably seen VEX in Cyclone DX. You've probably seen VEX in the form of CESAF and OpenVEX as well. the form of CESAF and OpenVEX as well. the form of CESAF and OpenVEX as well. Those are totally fine formats. I think Those are totally fine formats. I think Those are totally fine formats. I think those ones are really exciting. I would those ones are really exciting. I would those ones are really exciting. I would actually probably encourage you to have actually probably encourage you to have actually probably encourage you to have vex as a standalone document rather than vex as a standalone document rather than vex as a standalone document rather than directly embedded in the sbomb where directly embedded in the sbomb where directly embedded in the sbomb where possible primarily because new possible primarily because new possible primarily because new vulnerabilities are going to continue to vulnerabilities are going to continue to vulnerabilities are going to continue to come out whether you change your come out whether you change your come out whether you change your codebase or not. And so even though an codebase or not. And so even though an codebase or not. And so even though an sbomb is static the assessment around it sbomb is static the assessment around it sbomb is static the assessment around it oftentimes is very dynamic and oftentimes is very dynamic and oftentimes is very dynamic and particular on the vulnerability and particular on the vulnerability and particular on the vulnerability and support status side. Um and so I I do support status side. Um and so I I do support status side. Um and so I I do think this is a really important think this is a really important think this is a really important takeaway though. Oftentimes people takeaway though. Oftentimes people takeaway though. Oftentimes people really get this confused literally just really get this confused literally just really get this confused literally just these two lines here. What is my state? these two lines here. What is my state? these two lines here. What is my state? Am I affected, not affected, under Am I affected, not affected, under Am I affected, not affected, under investigation or has it been fixed? And investigation or has it been fixed? And investigation or has it been fixed? And then what's the justification and then what's the justification and then what's the justification and detailed information surrounding that? detailed information surrounding that? detailed information surrounding that? Um is sufficient enough in its most Um is sufficient enough in its most Um is sufficient enough in its most basic form to um to satisfy a VEX basic form to um to satisfy a VEX basic form to um to satisfy a VEX statement for statement for statement for you. Okay, we burned through um our kind you. Okay, we burned through um our kind you. Okay, we burned through um our kind of esbomb 101. Let's kind of hop into of esbomb 101. Let's kind of hop into of esbomb 101. Let's kind of hop into some of these scenarios um and see kind some of these scenarios um and see kind some of these scenarios um and see kind of what you're experiencing, what I'm of what you're experiencing, what I'm of what you're experiencing, what I'm seeing out there in the landscape. I'm seeing out there in the landscape. I'm seeing out there in the landscape. I'm going to start with the easiest one. And going to start with the easiest one. And going to start with the easiest one. And you'll notice that these scenarios you'll notice that these scenarios you'll notice that these scenarios actually build upon each other. And so actually build upon each other. And so actually build upon each other. And so if you have not reached scenario one, if you have not reached scenario one, if you have not reached scenario one, it's going to be really difficult for it's going to be really difficult for it's going to be really difficult for you to get to two and three. Um, and so you to get to two and three. Um, and so you to get to two and three. Um, and so this is where I would say 80 plus% of this is where I would say 80 plus% of this is where I would say 80 plus% of the industry is at right now, which is the industry is at right now, which is the industry is at right now, which is purely can I analyze my source code and purely can I analyze my source code and purely can I analyze my source code and whatever means that I want, right? whatever means that I want, right? whatever means that I want, right? Whether that's with some type of Whether that's with some type of Whether that's with some type of automated tooling, whether I would like automated tooling, whether I would like automated tooling, whether I would like to do, you know, run it through chatgbt to do, you know, run it through chatgbt to do, you know, run it through chatgbt and have it come up with the best answer and have it come up with the best answer and have it come up with the best answer for me, um, or I would like to use some for me, um, or I would like to use some for me, um, or I would like to use some of the build systems themselves. Um, of the build systems themselves. Um, of the build systems themselves. Um, either way, doesn't matter how you get either way, doesn't matter how you get either way, doesn't matter how you get it. how being able to generate that it. how being able to generate that it. how being able to generate that sbomb and distribute that on a regular sbomb and distribute that on a regular sbomb and distribute that on a regular basis is the first place that you want basis is the first place that you want basis is the first place that you want to start and being able to do so on a to start and being able to do so on a to start and being able to do so on a per build per commit per deployment per per build per commit per deployment per per build per commit per deployment per release cycle um start to become release cycle um start to become release cycle um start to become extremely important. Um we've already extremely important. Um we've already extremely important. Um we've already surfaced some motivations of where this surfaced some motivations of where this surfaced some motivations of where this is kind of coming from. I think the is kind of coming from. I think the is kind of coming from. I think the regulation is a big one. Um another one regulation is a big one. Um another one regulation is a big one. Um another one though that people don't talk about though that people don't talk about though that people don't talk about enough is this I am an indirect customer enough is this I am an indirect customer enough is this I am an indirect customer of a government contractor, right? of a government contractor, right? of a government contractor, right? Right. And so I don't do direct business Right. And so I don't do direct business Right. And so I don't do direct business with any government entities, but my with any government entities, but my with any government entities, but my customers customers do. And thus I now customers customers do. And thus I now customers customers do. And thus I now have to be able to um metriculate have to be able to um metriculate have to be able to um metriculate anything that they're using up to that anything that they're using up to that anything that they're using up to that level so they can kind of put it level so they can kind of put it level so they can kind of put it together and um use what I you'll hear together and um use what I you'll hear together and um use what I you'll hear me refer to as application level sbombs. me refer to as application level sbombs. me refer to as application level sbombs. Um oftent times you're taking your first Um oftent times you're taking your first Um oftent times you're taking your first party code, combining it with some type party code, combining it with some type party code, combining it with some type of third party binary or um other kind of third party binary or um other kind of third party binary or um other kind of final artifact and then you need to of final artifact and then you need to of final artifact and then you need to be able to represent that. Um we see be able to represent that. Um we see be able to represent that. Um we see this in particular um in the automotive this in particular um in the automotive this in particular um in the automotive space. have an infotainment system. The space. have an infotainment system. The space. have an infotainment system. The infotainment system has a bunch of SDKs infotainment system has a bunch of SDKs infotainment system has a bunch of SDKs and binaries coming from other suppliers and binaries coming from other suppliers and binaries coming from other suppliers because they control ECUs um and other because they control ECUs um and other because they control ECUs um and other parts of the car or they have some parts of the car or they have some parts of the car or they have some intelligence around braking and and intelligence around braking and and intelligence around braking and and things of that nature. And so you want things of that nature. And so you want things of that nature. And so you want to make sure that you can kind of put to make sure that you can kind of put to make sure that you can kind of put that final artifact together. Um of that final artifact together. Um of that final artifact together. Um of course the most valuable aspect in my course the most valuable aspect in my course the most valuable aspect in my opinion is purely just giving you opinion is purely just giving you opinion is purely just giving you insight into your software supply chain. insight into your software supply chain. insight into your software supply chain. your software supply chain both on the your software supply chain both on the your software supply chain both on the infrastructure side. Um but then oftent infrastructure side. Um but then oftent infrastructure side. Um but then oftent times we spend most of the conversation times we spend most of the conversation times we spend most of the conversation on vulnerabilities. There's even license on vulnerabilities. There's even license on vulnerabilities. There's even license compliance implications that can have compliance implications that can have compliance implications that can have security impacts if you're then forced security impacts if you're then forced security impacts if you're then forced to disclose your source code and you're to disclose your source code and you're to disclose your source code and you're not prepared for that influx of targeted not prepared for that influx of targeted not prepared for that influx of targeted attacks. Um let's kind of talk through attacks. Um let's kind of talk through attacks. Um let's kind of talk through some of these like technical challenges some of these like technical challenges some of these like technical challenges before I get into the workflow itself before I get into the workflow itself before I get into the workflow itself that I think you'll run into purely just that I think you'll run into purely just that I think you'll run into purely just trying to generate um an ESBO. Um, one trying to generate um an ESBO. Um, one trying to generate um an ESBO. Um, one of the big ones is oftentimes our code of the big ones is oftentimes our code of the big ones is oftentimes our code bases are very, very diverse. And so bases are very, very diverse. And so bases are very, very diverse. And so you'll see this kind of polyglut tooling you'll see this kind of polyglut tooling you'll see this kind of polyglut tooling that is necessary in order to kind of that is necessary in order to kind of that is necessary in order to kind of scan it. Very rarely will you be able to scan it. Very rarely will you be able to scan it. Very rarely will you be able to find just absolutely one tool that can find just absolutely one tool that can find just absolutely one tool that can scan absolutely everything. And so you scan absolutely everything. And so you scan absolutely everything. And so you have to figure out within your tech have to figure out within your tech have to figure out within your tech stack what is going to give you the most stack what is going to give you the most stack what is going to give you the most accurate list of components. Most accurate list of components. Most accurate list of components. Most importantly, how are you going to get importantly, how are you going to get importantly, how are you going to get those full relationships? Um, oftent those full relationships? Um, oftent those full relationships? Um, oftent times you see people scope to just times you see people scope to just times you see people scope to just direct dependencies in ESBOPS. That's direct dependencies in ESBOPS. That's direct dependencies in ESBOPS. That's terrible. Do not do that. Um, you need terrible. Do not do that. Um, you need terrible. Do not do that. Um, you need to have the full dependency graph to have the full dependency graph to have the full dependency graph including transitive dependencies as including transitive dependencies as including transitive dependencies as well as some ability to label and scope well as some ability to label and scope well as some ability to label and scope those dependencies. So you have context those dependencies. So you have context those dependencies. So you have context on are they statically linked versus on are they statically linked versus on are they statically linked versus dynamically linked that has wildly dynamically linked that has wildly dynamically linked that has wildly different implications for you. Um, are different implications for you. Um, are different implications for you. Um, are these dev and test dependencies? Are these dev and test dependencies? Are these dev and test dependencies? Are these production dependencies? And so these production dependencies? And so these production dependencies? And so being able to assert some of these being able to assert some of these being able to assert some of these different scopes is going to be different scopes is going to be different scopes is going to be incredibly powerful for you. incredibly powerful for you. incredibly powerful for you. Um, another really big challenge that Um, another really big challenge that Um, another really big challenge that you'll see is in particular if you you'll see is in particular if you you'll see is in particular if you operate in say like embedded systems or operate in say like embedded systems or operate in say like embedded systems or deployed systems is how do I actually deployed systems is how do I actually deployed systems is how do I actually have an accurate sbomb when there's no have an accurate sbomb when there's no have an accurate sbomb when there's no central package manager, right? If I'm central package manager, right? If I'm central package manager, right? If I'm using YTO or build route, I can using YTO or build route, I can using YTO or build route, I can literally point to, you know, zip files literally point to, you know, zip files literally point to, you know, zip files locally within my codebase. How do I locally within my codebase. How do I locally within my codebase. How do I represent that in a way that someone represent that in a way that someone represent that in a way that someone else can consume and being able to else can consume and being able to else can consume and being able to recognize? Um, there's some unique recognize? Um, there's some unique recognize? Um, there's some unique identifiers such as omniore ID that are identifiers such as omniore ID that are identifiers such as omniore ID that are starting to come up that I think are starting to come up that I think are starting to come up that I think are getting closer to be able to do so. Um, getting closer to be able to do so. Um, getting closer to be able to do so. Um, you'll you'll see me advocate for Pearl you'll you'll see me advocate for Pearl you'll you'll see me advocate for Pearl um very often, but even Pearl has its um very often, but even Pearl has its um very often, but even Pearl has its own challenges. Um, you'll never hear me own challenges. Um, you'll never hear me own challenges. Um, you'll never hear me advocate for CPA. It's absolutely advocate for CPA. It's absolutely advocate for CPA. It's absolutely god-awful. Do not use it in any way, god-awful. Do not use it in any way, god-awful. Do not use it in any way, shape, or form if you can avoid it. Um, shape, or form if you can avoid it. Um, shape, or form if you can avoid it. Um, however, um, there are some scenarios however, um, there are some scenarios however, um, there are some scenarios where you have no choice. Um, and thus, where you have no choice. Um, and thus, where you have no choice. Um, and thus, I I I digress. Um, before I kind of hop into digress. Um, before I kind of hop into digress. Um, before I kind of hop into the workflow itself, um, something that the workflow itself, um, something that the workflow itself, um, something that is often times forgotten about as you is often times forgotten about as you is often times forgotten about as you think about your risk management program think about your risk management program think about your risk management program is support status, right? Are your is support status, right? Are your is support status, right? Are your packages being actively maintained by packages being actively maintained by packages being actively maintained by the open source maintainer? Have they the open source maintainer? Have they the open source maintainer? Have they been abandoned? Um, and this is actually been abandoned? Um, and this is actually been abandoned? Um, and this is actually a tricky one in particular in the open a tricky one in particular in the open a tricky one in particular in the open source space because there's oftentimes source space because there's oftentimes source space because there's oftentimes not a central repository for this. I not a central repository for this. I not a central repository for this. I know there's a few people I think I ran know there's a few people I think I ran know there's a few people I think I ran into the uh the um Bumpgen or XL um into the uh the um Bumpgen or XL um into the uh the um Bumpgen or XL um group and they're starting to put a group and they're starting to put a group and they're starting to put a database together for that. You have database together for that. You have database together for that. You have things like end of life.date and and things like end of life.date and and things like end of life.date and and open EOX like we're starting to get some open EOX like we're starting to get some open EOX like we're starting to get some traction there. Um, but oftentimes the traction there. Um, but oftentimes the traction there. Um, but oftentimes the open source maintainer may not have open source maintainer may not have open source maintainer may not have updated a package purely because if it updated a package purely because if it updated a package purely because if it ain't broke, don't fix it, right? Like ain't broke, don't fix it, right? Like ain't broke, don't fix it, right? Like everything is operating just fine. Um, everything is operating just fine. Um, everything is operating just fine. Um, and you know, you have to be able to and you know, you have to be able to and you know, you have to be able to adjust and accommodate for those. All adjust and accommodate for those. All adjust and accommodate for those. All right, this is where I'll probably spend right, this is where I'll probably spend right, this is where I'll probably spend the bulk of my time on each scenario. the bulk of my time on each scenario. the bulk of my time on each scenario. So, I really want to kind of talk So, I really want to kind of talk So, I really want to kind of talk through this kind of workflow diagram, through this kind of workflow diagram, through this kind of workflow diagram, if you will, and then it's very if you will, and then it's very if you will, and then it's very important to kind of rock this initial important to kind of rock this initial important to kind of rock this initial one because all the other scenarios are one because all the other scenarios are one because all the other scenarios are going to um, build on top of that. Um, going to um, build on top of that. Um, going to um, build on top of that. Um, very very easy workflow, though. Um, I I very very easy workflow, though. Um, I I very very easy workflow, though. Um, I I believe in all of you. So, we're going believe in all of you. So, we're going believe in all of you. So, we're going to start with our source code. Um, to start with our source code. Um, to start with our source code. Um, you're going to do some stuff from a you're going to do some stuff from a you're going to do some stuff from a development perspective. You're going to development perspective. You're going to development perspective. You're going to add some new functionality. You're going add some new functionality. You're going add some new functionality. You're going to find some incredible package that to find some incredible package that to find some incredible package that makes your life easier. You're going to makes your life easier. You're going to makes your life easier. You're going to go ahead and integrate that. Um, at that go ahead and integrate that. Um, at that go ahead and integrate that. Um, at that point in time, you'll submit your PR. point in time, you'll submit your PR. point in time, you'll submit your PR. Um, and you're going to scan that Um, and you're going to scan that Um, and you're going to scan that against something, right? Whether you against something, right? Whether you against something, right? Whether you have internal tooling, commercial have internal tooling, commercial have internal tooling, commercial tooling, homegrown tooling, whatever it tooling, homegrown tooling, whatever it tooling, homegrown tooling, whatever it is, whatever your personal flavor um, is, whatever your personal flavor um, is, whatever your personal flavor um, and start to surface vulnerabilities and and start to surface vulnerabilities and and start to surface vulnerabilities and licenses based on that. Um, now the licenses based on that. Um, now the licenses based on that. Um, now the question is when you review those, what question is when you review those, what question is when you review those, what is your assessment? oftent times as we is your assessment? oftent times as we is your assessment? oftent times as we know I think it was what like 27,000 CVS know I think it was what like 27,000 CVS know I think it was what like 27,000 CVS came out last year 33,000 or so I think came out last year 33,000 or so I think came out last year 33,000 or so I think we're on pace for this year. Um just we're on pace for this year. Um just we're on pace for this year. Um just because a CVE exists on a particular because a CVE exists on a particular because a CVE exists on a particular package does not mean it's vulnerable in package does not mean it's vulnerable in package does not mean it's vulnerable in the uh specific way that you're using the uh specific way that you're using the uh specific way that you're using it. And so you have to do that it. And so you have to do that it. And so you have to do that assessment on these vulnerabilities. You assessment on these vulnerabilities. You assessment on these vulnerabilities. You have to do the same thing on the license have to do the same thing on the license have to do the same thing on the license compliance side which is if I have um compliance side which is if I have um compliance side which is if I have um copy left code that is LGBL um license copy left code that is LGBL um license copy left code that is LGBL um license but I am dynamically linking that as but I am dynamically linking that as but I am dynamically linking that as compared to statically linking. Now all compared to statically linking. Now all compared to statically linking. Now all of a sudden these source disclosure of a sudden these source disclosure of a sudden these source disclosure requirements are no longer required. Um requirements are no longer required. Um requirements are no longer required. Um and that begins to free you up. And so and that begins to free you up. And so and that begins to free you up. And so going back to that conversation around going back to that conversation around going back to that conversation around making sure that you have accurate making sure that you have accurate making sure that you have accurate package labels and scopes associated package labels and scopes associated package labels and scopes associated becomes really really critical um kind becomes really really critical um kind becomes really really critical um kind of inside of this workflow. Um as you're of inside of this workflow. Um as you're of inside of this workflow. Um as you're going through and reviewing uh these going through and reviewing uh these going through and reviewing uh these vulnerabilities, that's when you'll vulnerabilities, that's when you'll vulnerabilities, that's when you'll start to create your VEX and VDR start to create your VEX and VDR start to create your VEX and VDR assertions. So that way you can then assertions. So that way you can then assertions. So that way you can then proactively start to get ahead of proactively start to get ahead of proactively start to get ahead of whoever is going to consume these whoever is going to consume these whoever is going to consume these vulnerabilities um and ensure that you vulnerabilities um and ensure that you vulnerabilities um and ensure that you don't have any um problems there. You're don't have any um problems there. You're don't have any um problems there. You're going to merge um and and deploy that going to merge um and and deploy that going to merge um and and deploy that build and then generate your asbomb. And build and then generate your asbomb. And build and then generate your asbomb. And now for most people they think that you now for most people they think that you now for most people they think that you can stop there. Uh which for a very can stop there. Uh which for a very can stop there. Uh which for a very basic and simple application, yes, you basic and simple application, yes, you basic and simple application, yes, you probably can. Um I would imagine most of probably can. Um I would imagine most of probably can. Um I would imagine most of us in this room have much more complex us in this room have much more complex us in this room have much more complex development environments than that. And development environments than that. And development environments than that. And so between multi-stage builds, between so between multi-stage builds, between so between multi-stage builds, between having massive monor repos, between having massive monor repos, between having massive monor repos, between having, you know, very complicated having, you know, very complicated having, you know, very complicated architectures, you're probably going to architectures, you're probably going to architectures, you're probably going to have to put together um what I have to put together um what I have to put together um what I oftentimes refer to as this application oftentimes refer to as this application oftentimes refer to as this application level sbomb. And so do I have additional level sbomb. And so do I have additional level sbomb. And so do I have additional repos and projects that I need to have repos and projects that I need to have repos and projects that I need to have coverage for. Um if so, then I will coverage for. Um if so, then I will coverage for. Um if so, then I will rinse and repeat, right? And continue to rinse and repeat, right? And continue to rinse and repeat, right? And continue to kind of go through um that particular kind of go through um that particular kind of go through um that particular process. Once I've now have every single process. Once I've now have every single process. Once I've now have every single one of my repositories scanned, I've one of my repositories scanned, I've one of my repositories scanned, I've assessed the vulnerabilities, I've assessed the vulnerabilities, I've assessed the vulnerabilities, I've assessed the license risk, I've made VEX assessed the license risk, I've made VEX assessed the license risk, I've made VEX assertions on that, I want to make sure assertions on that, I want to make sure assertions on that, I want to make sure that I'm pinning that particular commit that I'm pinning that particular commit that I'm pinning that particular commit or release. Um, and that way I can or release. Um, and that way I can or release. Um, and that way I can continuously monitor that on a regular continuously monitor that on a regular continuously monitor that on a regular basis and be able to go back to that. basis and be able to go back to that. basis and be able to go back to that. Um, in particular, if you're maintaining Um, in particular, if you're maintaining Um, in particular, if you're maintaining multiple versions or if you have an multiple versions or if you have an multiple versions or if you have an on-prem and SAS deployment for similar on-prem and SAS deployment for similar on-prem and SAS deployment for similar situations, making sure that you have situations, making sure that you have situations, making sure that you have the ability to pin particular releases the ability to pin particular releases the ability to pin particular releases is one that I very rarely see people put is one that I very rarely see people put is one that I very rarely see people put a lot of emphasis on, but will a lot of emphasis on, but will a lot of emphasis on, but will your ESBOM program if you do not have your ESBOM program if you do not have your ESBOM program if you do not have that that that capability. Lastly, you get to deploy to capability. Lastly, you get to deploy to capability. Lastly, you get to deploy to production. Um, then everything is kind production. Um, then everything is kind production. Um, then everything is kind of nirvana um at that point and you're of nirvana um at that point and you're of nirvana um at that point and you're kind of off to the races. And so, um, kind of off to the races. And so, um, kind of off to the races. And so, um, this is kind of your initial workflow. this is kind of your initial workflow. this is kind of your initial workflow. If you're looking to generate sbombs on If you're looking to generate sbombs on If you're looking to generate sbombs on a regular basis, ideally, this could be a regular basis, ideally, this could be a regular basis, ideally, this could be a three-step process. You could submit a three-step process. You could submit a three-step process. You could submit your PR, you can get loans, your your PR, you can get loans, your your PR, you can get loans, your developers can assess them, and then developers can assess them, and then developers can assess them, and then everything else should be automated on everything else should be automated on everything else should be automated on the back half of that. I'm happy to kind the back half of that. I'm happy to kind the back half of that. I'm happy to kind of talk through more strategies on how of talk through more strategies on how of talk through more strategies on how to get there during the Q&amp;A portion. All right. Um, a couple of just portion. All right. Um, a couple of just portion. All right. Um, a couple of just like best practices if you're going to like best practices if you're going to like best practices if you're going to take this approach. How you choose to take this approach. How you choose to take this approach. How you choose to distribute your ESBOM is very, very distribute your ESBOM is very, very distribute your ESBOM is very, very important. Um, as I mentioned earlier, important. Um, as I mentioned earlier, important. Um, as I mentioned earlier, the sbomb itself is static. Analysis the sbomb itself is static. Analysis the sbomb itself is static. Analysis around that is very dynamic. And so around that is very dynamic. And so around that is very dynamic. And so having a process on each build, on each having a process on each build, on each having a process on each build, on each deployment, on each release that you're deployment, on each release that you're deployment, on each release that you're reviewing that you can publicly share reviewing that you can publicly share reviewing that you can publicly share that in some way, whether that's a that in some way, whether that's a that in some way, whether that's a homegrown um tooling or you're using homegrown um tooling or you're using homegrown um tooling or you're using something commercial is going to be something commercial is going to be something commercial is going to be critical for you. Um this is an example critical for you. Um this is an example critical for you. Um this is an example of the CNCF um portal um where they're of the CNCF um portal um where they're of the CNCF um portal um where they're sharing sbombs for CNCF projects like sharing sbombs for CNCF projects like sharing sbombs for CNCF projects like Kubernetes and um things of that nature Kubernetes and um things of that nature Kubernetes and um things of that nature that you can go review publicly if you'd that you can go review publicly if you'd that you can go review publicly if you'd like to take a look at what some other like to take a look at what some other like to take a look at what some other organizations are doing. Um Red Hat also organizations are doing. Um Red Hat also organizations are doing. Um Red Hat also has a phenomenal portal um around ESBOM. has a phenomenal portal um around ESBOM. has a phenomenal portal um around ESBOM. So I would definitely check them out as well. All well. All well. All righty. That is scenario one. Um, I want righty. That is scenario one. Um, I want righty. That is scenario one. Um, I want to hop into scenario two now that we to hop into scenario two now that we to hop into scenario two now that we have kind of an understanding of what have kind of an understanding of what have kind of an understanding of what you would do from a baseline sbomb you would do from a baseline sbomb you would do from a baseline sbomb generation perspective. Um, this is a generation perspective. Um, this is a generation perspective. Um, this is a unique one that I haven't seen a ton of unique one that I haven't seen a ton of unique one that I haven't seen a ton of organizations do, but the ones that I organizations do, but the ones that I organizations do, but the ones that I have seen operate in this way have been have seen operate in this way have been have seen operate in this way have been highly effective. Splunk and US Bank are highly effective. Splunk and US Bank are highly effective. Splunk and US Bank are the media ones that come in mind, which the media ones that come in mind, which the media ones that come in mind, which is to say oftent times I do not have is to say oftent times I do not have is to say oftent times I do not have direct access to the source code across direct access to the source code across direct access to the source code across my entire organization. Um, I very my entire organization. Um, I very my entire organization. Um, I very distinctly remember working at GE Power distinctly remember working at GE Power distinctly remember working at GE Power being a cyber security architect and not being a cyber security architect and not being a cyber security architect and not having the ability to access all of my having the ability to access all of my having the ability to access all of my GitHub repositories throughout my entire GitHub repositories throughout my entire GitHub repositories throughout my entire organization made no sense to me organization made no sense to me organization made no sense to me whatsoever as the security professional. whatsoever as the security professional. whatsoever as the security professional. But um, at the end of the day, you have But um, at the end of the day, you have But um, at the end of the day, you have to have separation of duties and all to have separation of duties and all to have separation of duties and all kinds of other regulations that tend to kinds of other regulations that tend to kinds of other regulations that tend to limit your access for a uh, god account limit your access for a uh, god account limit your access for a uh, god account if you will. And so if you don't have if you will. And so if you don't have if you will. And so if you don't have direct source code access, you have a direct source code access, you have a direct source code access, you have a few options. You can either wrangle your few options. You can either wrangle your few options. You can either wrangle your development teams, try to go CI pipeline development teams, try to go CI pipeline development teams, try to go CI pipeline by CI pipeline to get them fully by CI pipeline to get them fully by CI pipeline to get them fully integrated and spend the next three integrated and spend the next three integrated and spend the next three years trying to get coverage across your years trying to get coverage across your years trying to get coverage across your organization or you can give them an organization or you can give them an organization or you can give them an SBOM spec to follow and say at the end SBOM spec to follow and say at the end SBOM spec to follow and say at the end of the day, I don't care how you do it. of the day, I don't care how you do it. of the day, I don't care how you do it. I don't care what tooling you use for I don't care what tooling you use for I don't care what tooling you use for it. Here's the minimum requirements that it. Here's the minimum requirements that it. Here's the minimum requirements that I will need in an ESBOM and I need you I will need in an ESBOM and I need you I will need in an ESBOM and I need you to generate one per build. And then you to generate one per build. And then you to generate one per build. And then you can then centralize that information can then centralize that information can then centralize that information whether you have source code access. Um whether you have source code access. Um whether you have source code access. Um now why do you want to centralize now why do you want to centralize now why do you want to centralize vulnerability management? Oftent times vulnerability management? Oftent times vulnerability management? Oftent times um we are competing with the fact that um we are competing with the fact that um we are competing with the fact that you got to deliver product right you got you got to deliver product right you got you got to deliver product right you got to deploy because you're trying to to deploy because you're trying to to deploy because you're trying to make money. And so at the end of the day make money. And so at the end of the day make money. And so at the end of the day vulnerability management is an adjacent vulnerability management is an adjacent vulnerability management is an adjacent function to what you're looking to do function to what you're looking to do function to what you're looking to do that is probably not a monetary function that is probably not a monetary function that is probably not a monetary function for you all. And so when you're then for you all. And so when you're then for you all. And so when you're then trying to make trying to make trying to make enterprisewide decisions on similar tech enterprisewide decisions on similar tech enterprisewide decisions on similar tech stacks because let's be honest, most of stacks because let's be honest, most of stacks because let's be honest, most of our development teams are just using a our development teams are just using a our development teams are just using a boilerplate version of the same tech boilerplate version of the same tech boilerplate version of the same tech stack that's available in a hundred stack that's available in a hundred stack that's available in a hundred other teams throughout that other teams throughout that other teams throughout that organization. And so you start to have organization. And so you start to have organization. And so you start to have these opportunities where you can get these opportunities where you can get these opportunities where you can get some real synergies on planning your some real synergies on planning your some real synergies on planning your remediation efforts. A kind of guiding remediation efforts. A kind of guiding remediation efforts. A kind of guiding um tagline that I want you to think um tagline that I want you to think um tagline that I want you to think about for this scenario too is how do I about for this scenario too is how do I about for this scenario too is how do I have the greatest overall reduction in have the greatest overall reduction in have the greatest overall reduction in my security posture with the least my security posture with the least my security posture with the least amount of refactor effort. And that amount of refactor effort. And that amount of refactor effort. And that least amount of refactor effort is least amount of refactor effort is least amount of refactor effort is important because if you have to do a important because if you have to do a important because if you have to do a complete refactor in order to remediate complete refactor in order to remediate complete refactor in order to remediate one vulnerability, that was poor one vulnerability, that was poor one vulnerability, that was poor prioritization on your part and you prioritization on your part and you prioritization on your part and you should be trying to get the biggest bang should be trying to get the biggest bang should be trying to get the biggest bang for your buck based on that. Um, and how for your buck based on that. Um, and how for your buck based on that. Um, and how do you do that without having insight? do you do that without having insight? do you do that without having insight? Right? And so that's kind of where we'll Right? And so that's kind of where we'll Right? And so that's kind of where we'll begin to start. Um, how many people have begin to start. Um, how many people have begin to start. Um, how many people have heard of SSVC, the stakeholder specific heard of SSVC, the stakeholder specific heard of SSVC, the stakeholder specific vulnerability categorization? Great. vulnerability categorization? Great. vulnerability categorization? Great. Great. Um, man, we this is a very Great. Um, man, we this is a very Great. Um, man, we this is a very educated group. I'm loving this. Um, educated group. I'm loving this. Um, educated group. I'm loving this. Um, SSVC is interesting. Um, very SSVC is interesting. Um, very SSVC is interesting. Um, very transparently, way too complicated. like transparently, way too complicated. like transparently, way too complicated. like absolutely way too complicated from my absolutely way too complicated from my absolutely way too complicated from my perspective, on a decision-making perspective, on a decision-making perspective, on a decision-making perspective, but it is fantastic in its perspective, but it is fantastic in its perspective, but it is fantastic in its theory, which is I need to be able to theory, which is I need to be able to theory, which is I need to be able to make a determination on for a particular make a determination on for a particular make a determination on for a particular vulnerability. Do I drop everything and vulnerability. Do I drop everything and vulnerability. Do I drop everything and fix it now? Do I plan for that next fix it now? Do I plan for that next fix it now? Do I plan for that next quarter? Um, or can I just put this into quarter? Um, or can I just put this into quarter? Um, or can I just put this into my normal, you know, kind of sprintly my normal, you know, kind of sprintly my normal, you know, kind of sprintly planning cycle. Um, you'll see my planning cycle. Um, you'll see my planning cycle. Um, you'll see my workflow here in a bit. I've taken an workflow here in a bit. I've taken an workflow here in a bit. I've taken an attempt at trying to, for lack of a attempt at trying to, for lack of a attempt at trying to, for lack of a better term, reduce the complexity and better term, reduce the complexity and better term, reduce the complexity and what I would say is kind of a custom what I would say is kind of a custom what I would say is kind of a custom iteration of SSVC. I encourage every iteration of SSVC. I encourage every iteration of SSVC. I encourage every organization to build your own decision organization to build your own decision organization to build your own decision tree um as you decide where drop tree um as you decide where drop tree um as you decide where drop immediate vulnerability versus one that immediate vulnerability versus one that immediate vulnerability versus one that can be planned for as we all try to meet can be planned for as we all try to meet can be planned for as we all try to meet this goal of risk reduction rather than this goal of risk reduction rather than this goal of risk reduction rather than risk elimination. Um continue my thr uh risk elimination. Um continue my thr uh risk elimination. Um continue my thr uh trend. I'm sorry. As I said, I'm a trend. I'm sorry. As I said, I'm a trend. I'm sorry. As I said, I'm a person of strong opinions. Pearl's a person of strong opinions. Pearl's a person of strong opinions. Pearl's a thousand times better than CPE. Um don't thousand times better than CPE. Um don't thousand times better than CPE. Um don't at me. Um I I seriously because uh my at me. Um I I seriously because uh my at me. Um I I seriously because uh my biggest frustration on the CPE side, biggest frustration on the CPE side, biggest frustration on the CPE side, I'll go on a small tangent, is that CPUs I'll go on a small tangent, is that CPUs I'll go on a small tangent, is that CPUs are not created until a vulnerability are not created until a vulnerability are not created until a vulnerability exists on a package. Um that inherently exists on a package. Um that inherently exists on a package. Um that inherently makes it impossible to uniquely identify makes it impossible to uniquely identify makes it impossible to uniquely identify a package based on that. Oftent times a package based on that. Oftent times a package based on that. Oftent times vulnerabilities haven't been found yet vulnerabilities haven't been found yet vulnerabilities haven't been found yet for net new packages. Often times an for net new packages. Often times an for net new packages. Often times an organization creates a CPE and that is organization creates a CPE and that is organization creates a CPE and that is not the same CPE that MITER will create not the same CPE that MITER will create not the same CPE that MITER will create when a vulnerability now exists. And so when a vulnerability now exists. And so when a vulnerability now exists. And so you have a lot of tooling that is you have a lot of tooling that is you have a lot of tooling that is hallucinating CBES that are now wildly hallucinating CBES that are now wildly hallucinating CBES that are now wildly inaccurate. And so instead of trying to inaccurate. And so instead of trying to inaccurate. And so instead of trying to uniquely identify vulnerabilities, you uniquely identify vulnerabilities, you uniquely identify vulnerabilities, you should try to uniquely identify the should try to uniquely identify the should try to uniquely identify the asset. And that's what makes Pearl a far asset. And that's what makes Pearl a far asset. And that's what makes Pearl a far better standard because it gives you a better standard because it gives you a better standard because it gives you a specific name space for a specific specific name space for a specific specific name space for a specific package for a specific version. package for a specific version. package for a specific version. Um, I got a question for the audience Um, I got a question for the audience Um, I got a question for the audience because I'm in this deep now and I must because I'm in this deep now and I must because I'm in this deep now and I must know. If I have GIC know. If I have GIC know. If I have GIC C1.3 and that's a Divian package and I C1.3 and that's a Divian package and I C1.3 and that's a Divian package and I have GIBC 1.3 and that's a CentOS have GIBC 1.3 and that's a CentOS have GIBC 1.3 and that's a CentOS package, are those the same packages? Yes, that's the great answer. packages? Yes, that's the great answer. packages? Yes, that's the great answer. They are not the same package. And They are not the same package. And They are not the same package. And oftent times people will assume that oftent times people will assume that oftent times people will assume that they are the same, that their they are the same, that their they are the same, that their vulnerabilities can be the same, and vulnerabilities can be the same, and vulnerabilities can be the same, and that their licenses can be the same. And that their licenses can be the same. And that their licenses can be the same. And yes, sometimes they are, but often times yes, sometimes they are, but often times yes, sometimes they are, but often times they can be dramatically different. And they can be dramatically different. And they can be dramatically different. And so that is where this distinction or so that is where this distinction or so that is where this distinction or this ability to be able to uniquely this ability to be able to uniquely this ability to be able to uniquely identify particular package becomes identify particular package becomes identify particular package becomes wildly um wildly um wildly um important. Some other challenges you're important. Some other challenges you're important. Some other challenges you're going to run into is like how do you going to run into is like how do you going to run into is like how do you between spec though um you have to be able to do spec though um you have to be able to do spec though um you have to be able to do a little bit of mental gymnastics um to a little bit of mental gymnastics um to a little bit of mental gymnastics um to be able to convert from you know be able to convert from you know be able to convert from you know manufacturer to supplier to originator. manufacturer to supplier to originator. manufacturer to supplier to originator. And I know this um like protobomb and And I know this um like protobomb and And I know this um like protobomb and some other tooling out there um that some other tooling out there um that some other tooling out there um that will allow for and lastly um you have to have for and lastly um you have to have for and lastly um you have to have consistency on when in your SDLC you're consistency on when in your SDLC you're consistency on when in your SDLC you're actually building uh these sbombs. Um actually building uh these sbombs. Um actually building uh these sbombs. Um lots of open debate when is the most lots of open debate when is the most lots of open debate when is the most accurate place to be able to generate an accurate place to be able to generate an accurate place to be able to generate an SBOM. You can do that at source. Uh you SBOM. You can do that at source. Uh you SBOM. You can do that at source. Uh you can do that at build time. Um you can do can do that at build time. Um you can do can do that at build time. Um you can do that right before you deploy. You can do that right before you deploy. You can do that right before you deploy. You can do that at runtime. Um I would advocate for that at runtime. Um I would advocate for that at runtime. Um I would advocate for you doing that at build time. Um I think you doing that at build time. Um I think you doing that at build time. Um I think that's when you're going to get the most that's when you're going to get the most that's when you're going to get the most accurate dependency graph. Um the accurate dependency graph. Um the accurate dependency graph. Um the challenge with runtime, which would challenge with runtime, which would challenge with runtime, which would probably be the better um aspect, is it probably be the better um aspect, is it probably be the better um aspect, is it becomes really difficult to then relate becomes really difficult to then relate becomes really difficult to then relate uh relationships when you're only doing uh relationships when you're only doing uh relationships when you're only doing scanning at runtime because you tend to scanning at runtime because you tend to scanning at runtime because you tend to lose the context of those relationships lose the context of those relationships lose the context of those relationships and you don't want to be forced in a and you don't want to be forced in a and you don't want to be forced in a situation where you're evaluating a situation where you're evaluating a situation where you're evaluating a vulnerability that is 10 layers deep um vulnerability that is 10 layers deep um vulnerability that is 10 layers deep um from a transitive perspective. And in from a transitive perspective. And in from a transitive perspective. And in order to actually remediate that, you order to actually remediate that, you order to actually remediate that, you have to fix four different direct have to fix four different direct have to fix four different direct dependencies. Um, I won't go into the dependencies. Um, I won't go into the dependencies. Um, I won't go into the diamond dependency problem with you all diamond dependency problem with you all diamond dependency problem with you all right now, but you seem like a smart right now, but you seem like a smart right now, but you seem like a smart group, so I'm sure you'll be able to group, so I'm sure you'll be able to group, so I'm sure you'll be able to look it up in your free look it up in your free look it up in your free time. All right, let's talk about our time. All right, let's talk about our time. All right, let's talk about our workflow then. Um, which is now we've workflow then. Um, which is now we've workflow then. Um, which is now we've switched from a pure generation um, switched from a pure generation um, switched from a pure generation um, workflow to I now want to be able to workflow to I now want to be able to workflow to I now want to be able to take this SSVC style approach to making take this SSVC style approach to making take this SSVC style approach to making vulnerability assertions or vulnerability assertions or vulnerability assertions or vulnerability groupings um, on my vulnerability groupings um, on my vulnerability groupings um, on my refactor efforts. And so you're going to refactor efforts. And so you're going to refactor efforts. And so you're going to see that I'm starting at this see that I'm starting at this see that I'm starting at this application level sbomb. So everything application level sbomb. So everything application level sbomb. So everything that we've already gone over in scenario that we've already gone over in scenario that we've already gone over in scenario one has to have occurred before you can one has to have occurred before you can one has to have occurred before you can kind of reach this point in your esbomb kind of reach this point in your esbomb kind of reach this point in your esbomb maturity um if you will. Um and I'll maturity um if you will. Um and I'll maturity um if you will. Um and I'll I'll I'll take a pause for a second and I'll I'll take a pause for a second and I'll I'll take a pause for a second and say that where this came from is we were say that where this came from is we were say that where this came from is we were seeing these massive organizations that seeing these massive organizations that seeing these massive organizations that might have three or 400,000 might have three or 400,000 might have three or 400,000 vulnerabilities. Um every single team vulnerabilities. Um every single team vulnerabilities. Um every single team was out of SLA um because they were on was out of SLA um because they were on was out of SLA um because they were on you know spring boot 4 for whatever you know spring boot 4 for whatever you know spring boot 4 for whatever reason and it was complete refactor reason and it was complete refactor reason and it was complete refactor effort for them to remediate absolutely effort for them to remediate absolutely effort for them to remediate absolutely anything. And so you then um are in this anything. And so you then um are in this anything. And so you then um are in this position where your choices are to just position where your choices are to just position where your choices are to just allow for all this risk to continue on. allow for all this risk to continue on. allow for all this risk to continue on. Um or you have to make a you know kind Um or you have to make a you know kind Um or you have to make a you know kind of a shot in the dark and guess and say of a shot in the dark and guess and say of a shot in the dark and guess and say you know what well uh Jackson Databond you know what well uh Jackson Databond you know what well uh Jackson Databond has the most vulnerability so I'll just has the most vulnerability so I'll just has the most vulnerability so I'll just fix that one thing because that makes me fix that one thing because that makes me fix that one thing because that makes me feel warm and fuzzy um on the inside. feel warm and fuzzy um on the inside. feel warm and fuzzy um on the inside. Um, instead I would prefer for you to Um, instead I would prefer for you to Um, instead I would prefer for you to take approach where you can actually take approach where you can actually take approach where you can actually group fixes and vulnerabilities together group fixes and vulnerabilities together group fixes and vulnerabilities together and then you start to work your way back and then you start to work your way back and then you start to work your way back into what is going to be the least path into what is going to be the least path into what is going to be the least path of least path of resistance, sorry, um, of least path of resistance, sorry, um, of least path of resistance, sorry, um, for your greatest vulnerability effort. for your greatest vulnerability effort. for your greatest vulnerability effort. So, we've now generated um, that sbomb So, we've now generated um, that sbomb So, we've now generated um, that sbomb at the application level. You're going at the application level. You're going at the application level. You're going to import that into your tooling of to import that into your tooling of to import that into your tooling of choice. Once again, there's kinds of choice. Once again, there's kinds of choice. Once again, there's kinds of free options like dependency track. Of free options like dependency track. Of free options like dependency track. Of course, there's some other options that course, there's some other options that course, there's some other options that I can advocate for you as well. Um, from I can advocate for you as well. Um, from I can advocate for you as well. Um, from there you want to then make sure that there you want to then make sure that there you want to then make sure that you have those unique identifiers. With you have those unique identifiers. With you have those unique identifiers. With something like a Pearl, you'll then be something like a Pearl, you'll then be something like a Pearl, you'll then be able to do a lookup on both licenses and able to do a lookup on both licenses and able to do a lookup on both licenses and vulnerabilities, and you don't have to vulnerabilities, and you don't have to vulnerabilities, and you don't have to worry about trying to ingest a VEX or worry about trying to ingest a VEX or worry about trying to ingest a VEX or VDR statement directly and have that be VDR statement directly and have that be VDR statement directly and have that be your source of truth. Um, that's now your source of truth. Um, that's now your source of truth. Um, that's now when you start to get into some fun uh when you start to get into some fun uh when you start to get into some fun uh decision-m, right? And so, first uh kind decision-m, right? And so, first uh kind decision-m, right? And so, first uh kind of question up there is how critical is of question up there is how critical is of question up there is how critical is this application for me, right? Is this this application for me, right? Is this this application for me, right? Is this a crown jewel application? Is this a crown jewel application? Is this a crown jewel application? Is this externally facing? Is this an internal externally facing? Is this an internal externally facing? Is this an internal development tool? it's an internal development tool? it's an internal development tool? it's an internal development tool, then you might want to development tool, then you might want to development tool, then you might want to immediately start to put that in your immediately start to put that in your immediately start to put that in your quarterly planning process and you're quarterly planning process and you're quarterly planning process and you're already going to have SLAs's in place to already going to have SLAs's in place to already going to have SLAs's in place to be able to deal with that. Um, assuming be able to deal with that. Um, assuming be able to deal with that. Um, assuming that this is some type of critical act that this is some type of critical act that this is some type of critical act with um application for you, that then with um application for you, that then with um application for you, that then moves into your next step, which is is moves into your next step, which is is moves into your next step, which is is this vulnerable or exploitable in the this vulnerable or exploitable in the this vulnerable or exploitable in the context that I'm using. And that is context that I'm using. And that is context that I'm using. And that is often times a very expensive question um often times a very expensive question um often times a very expensive question um to answer very transparently. And so you to answer very transparently. And so you to answer very transparently. And so you can approximate it with some data can approximate it with some data can approximate it with some data sources if you would like. Um, you'll sources if you would like. Um, you'll sources if you would like. Um, you'll see obviously our good friend uh Jay see obviously our good friend uh Jay see obviously our good friend uh Jay Jacobs is, you know, shouting EPSS from Jacobs is, you know, shouting EPSS from Jacobs is, you know, shouting EPSS from the rooftops, which I'm a massive fan of the rooftops, which I'm a massive fan of the rooftops, which I'm a massive fan of as well. You can use things like EBSS as well. You can use things like EBSS as well. You can use things like EBSS thresholds to be able to assert a thresholds to be able to assert a thresholds to be able to assert a probability on exploitability if you probability on exploitability if you probability on exploitability if you don't necessarily have the engineering don't necessarily have the engineering don't necessarily have the engineering time and and effort to be able to time and and effort to be able to time and and effort to be able to specifically confirm um whether you're specifically confirm um whether you're specifically confirm um whether you're exploited with that or not. There's all exploited with that or not. There's all exploited with that or not. There's all kinds of other um you know data sources kinds of other um you know data sources kinds of other um you know data sources as well like bone check that has you as well like bone check that has you as well like bone check that has you know the MVD++ and some other things know the MVD++ and some other things know the MVD++ and some other things that you can use to kind of approximate that you can use to kind of approximate that you can use to kind of approximate exploitability at scale. exploitability at scale. exploitability at scale. Um moving on from that um after you've Um moving on from that um after you've Um moving on from that um after you've made a determination on whether it's made a determination on whether it's made a determination on whether it's going to be explored or not in the going to be explored or not in the going to be explored or not in the particular context that you're using um particular context that you're using um particular context that you're using um you have to determine is there immediate you have to determine is there immediate you have to determine is there immediate fix um for that particular vulnerability fix um for that particular vulnerability fix um for that particular vulnerability um and if there is an immediate fix does um and if there is an immediate fix does um and if there is an immediate fix does that fix introduce more bones and that that fix introduce more bones and that that fix introduce more bones and that one is critical um very transparently one is critical um very transparently one is critical um very transparently because oftent times you'll I will see because oftent times you'll I will see because oftent times you'll I will see customers go through this kind of customers go through this kind of customers go through this kind of whack-a-ole um style effort of where whack-a-ole um style effort of where whack-a-ole um style effort of where you'll be on one particular vulnerable you'll be on one particular vulnerable you'll be on one particular vulnerable version you'll upgrade that package that version you'll upgrade that package that version you'll upgrade that package that then introduce three more critical then introduce three more critical then introduce three more critical vulnerabil ilities to you and you're in vulnerabil ilities to you and you're in vulnerabil ilities to you and you're in this never- ending cycle. And going back this never- ending cycle. And going back this never- ending cycle. And going back to my original goal, my original to my original goal, my original to my original goal, my original assessment, which is how do I have the assessment, which is how do I have the assessment, which is how do I have the greatest vulnerability impact with the greatest vulnerability impact with the greatest vulnerability impact with the least amount of refactor effort, the least amount of refactor effort, the least amount of refactor effort, the only way you're going to determine that only way you're going to determine that only way you're going to determine that is by having both insight into what is by having both insight into what is by having both insight into what bones are introduced with an upgrade as bones are introduced with an upgrade as bones are introduced with an upgrade as well as which ones are going to go away. well as which ones are going to go away. well as which ones are going to go away. And then you kind of just repeat that And then you kind of just repeat that And then you kind of just repeat that cycle, right? If that vulner if that cycle, right? If that vulner if that cycle, right? If that vulner if that immediate fix introduces more bones, immediate fix introduces more bones, immediate fix introduces more bones, great. No, I have to then go to the next great. No, I have to then go to the next great. No, I have to then go to the next one. Um once I go to that next one, I one. Um once I go to that next one, I one. Um once I go to that next one, I can now do an assessment on what can now do an assessment on what can now do an assessment on what vulnerabilities are being introduced vulnerabilities are being introduced vulnerabilities are being introduced there. This sounds like a really there. This sounds like a really there. This sounds like a really difficult manual process. There's a ton difficult manual process. There's a ton difficult manual process. There's a ton of tooling um that will do this of tooling um that will do this of tooling um that will do this automatically for you. And any good um automatically for you. And any good um automatically for you. And any good um vulnerability tooling will take into vulnerability tooling will take into vulnerability tooling will take into their fix recommendations, whether that their fix recommendations, whether that their fix recommendations, whether that is increasing or decreasing your is increasing or decreasing your is increasing or decreasing your security posture um kind of based on security posture um kind of based on security posture um kind of based on that. After um you've worked your way um that. After um you've worked your way um that. After um you've worked your way um through this particular um loop, if you through this particular um loop, if you through this particular um loop, if you will, you then determine, okay, great. will, you then determine, okay, great. will, you then determine, okay, great. I'm not introducing any more worse I'm not introducing any more worse I'm not introducing any more worse vulnerabilities. Am I now starting to vulnerabilities. Am I now starting to vulnerabilities. Am I now starting to get, you know, some BOGO deals on my get, you know, some BOGO deals on my get, you know, some BOGO deals on my remediation, right? Do I remediate other remediation, right? Do I remediate other remediation, right? Do I remediate other vulnerabilities as a part of that? Um, vulnerabilities as a part of that? Um, vulnerabilities as a part of that? Um, yes, you finally do. Fantastic. Um, and yes, you finally do. Fantastic. Um, and yes, you finally do. Fantastic. Um, and then lastly, the most important question then lastly, the most important question then lastly, the most important question is, does this introduce a breaking is, does this introduce a breaking is, does this introduce a breaking change? Right? If it does introduce a change? Right? If it does introduce a change? Right? If it does introduce a breaking change, you're going to have to breaking change, you're going to have to breaking change, you're going to have to do a much more quarterly um, I'm sorry, do a much more quarterly um, I'm sorry, do a much more quarterly um, I'm sorry, you're going to have to do either you're going to have to do either you're going to have to do either sprintly or quarterly planning process sprintly or quarterly planning process sprintly or quarterly planning process for that. If it does not, you've 100% for that. If it does not, you've 100% for that. If it does not, you've 100% met your happy path. You should met your happy path. You should met your happy path. You should immediate that, remedi um, remediate immediate that, remedi um, remediate immediate that, remedi um, remediate that immediately, do your package that immediately, do your package that immediately, do your package version bump, and then go about your version bump, and then go about your version bump, and then go about your life. Um if not you kind of continue to life. Um if not you kind of continue to life. Um if not you kind of continue to go back through the cycle and you do go back through the cycle and you do go back through the cycle and you do this for each vulnerability. Perfect. Um and that is vulnerability. Perfect. Um and that is vulnerability. Perfect. Um and that is that kind of scenario too. Um workflow that kind of scenario too. Um workflow that kind of scenario too. Um workflow in a nutshell. I want to kind of call in a nutshell. I want to kind of call in a nutshell. I want to kind of call how this grouping can actually be done how this grouping can actually be done how this grouping can actually be done on an automated basis. So that way on an automated basis. So that way on an automated basis. So that way you're not worrying about doing this you're not worrying about doing this you're not worrying about doing this yourself. You can see things like quick yourself. You can see things like quick yourself. You can see things like quick wins which are going to be easy patch wins which are going to be easy patch wins which are going to be easy patch upgrades don't require any refactors. upgrades don't require any refactors. upgrades don't require any refactors. Groups the vulnerabilities together for Groups the vulnerabilities together for Groups the vulnerabilities together for you. Um you also see some assertions on you. Um you also see some assertions on you. Um you also see some assertions on things like high priority things like high priority things like high priority vulnerabilities. How are you determining vulnerabilities. How are you determining vulnerabilities. How are you determining that right over certain eps thresholds? that right over certain eps thresholds? that right over certain eps thresholds? Is there reachability information? Is there reachability information? Is there reachability information? Meaning you've actually confirmed that Meaning you've actually confirmed that Meaning you've actually confirmed that you're using a vulnerable function via you're using a vulnerable function via you're using a vulnerable function via static analysis. Uh is it on the CC kev static analysis. Uh is it on the CC kev static analysis. Uh is it on the CC kev list? Is there a known exploit on list? Is there a known exploit on list? Is there a known exploit on exploit DB? Lots of these factors can go exploit DB? Lots of these factors can go exploit DB? Lots of these factors can go into how you choose to fine-tune and into how you choose to fine-tune and into how you choose to fine-tune and pull on different levers to determine a pull on different levers to determine a pull on different levers to determine a high priority fix for you. Um but more high priority fix for you. Um but more high priority fix for you. Um but more importantly, what other vulnerabilities importantly, what other vulnerabilities importantly, what other vulnerabilities do I get for free by making this change? do I get for free by making this change? do I get for free by making this change? Um because at the end of the day, if Um because at the end of the day, if Um because at the end of the day, if you're going from 3.0 to 5.0, I can you're going from 3.0 to 5.0, I can you're going from 3.0 to 5.0, I can assure you that's going to be a pretty assure you that's going to be a pretty assure you that's going to be a pretty decent refactor. And so you might as decent refactor. And so you might as decent refactor. And so you might as well get the largest bang for your buck well get the largest bang for your buck well get the largest bang for your buck on that particular one when you're doing on that particular one when you're doing on that particular one when you're doing your quarterly planning cycle. So all right, I think I'm doing decently So all right, I think I'm doing decently So all right, I think I'm doing decently um on time, which is absolutely um on time, which is absolutely um on time, which is absolutely fantastic. So I'm going to get into what fantastic. So I'm going to get into what fantastic. So I'm going to get into what is my personal favorite um scenario, is my personal favorite um scenario, is my personal favorite um scenario, which is kind of enforcing esbomb which is kind of enforcing esbomb which is kind of enforcing esbomb standards on external suppliers. I standards on external suppliers. I standards on external suppliers. I actually truly strongly believe that actually truly strongly believe that actually truly strongly believe that this is what sbombs were always meant to this is what sbombs were always meant to this is what sbombs were always meant to do. I imagine this future, we're not do. I imagine this future, we're not do. I imagine this future, we're not there yet, but I imagine this future there yet, but I imagine this future there yet, but I imagine this future where every organization has no problems where every organization has no problems where every organization has no problems publicly sharing asbombs. They need to publicly sharing asbombs. They need to publicly sharing asbombs. They need to do so privately. I will go into more do so privately. I will go into more do so privately. I will go into more strong opinions on why I think some strong opinions on why I think some strong opinions on why I think some concerns there are completely overblown. concerns there are completely overblown. concerns there are completely overblown. Um but ultimately, uh if I could be in a Um but ultimately, uh if I could be in a Um but ultimately, uh if I could be in a position where I could force Apple to position where I could force Apple to position where I could force Apple to give me an esp. Um I don't think we're give me an esp. Um I don't think we're give me an esp. Um I don't think we're there yet. Um but but that is the future there yet. Um but but that is the future there yet. Um but but that is the future that we're marching that we're marching that we're marching towards. Um as as we continue with many towards. Um as as we continue with many towards. Um as as we continue with many of our scenarios, kind of talk about of our scenarios, kind of talk about of our scenarios, kind of talk about some motivations. What do you think is some motivations. What do you think is some motivations. What do you think is uh kind of driving this direction? I uh kind of driving this direction? I uh kind of driving this direction? I think that software supply chain think that software supply chain think that software supply chain transparency is the the cheesy transparency is the the cheesy transparency is the the cheesy statement. I think in reality trust but statement. I think in reality trust but statement. I think in reality trust but verify is kind of the common theme in verify is kind of the common theme in verify is kind of the common theme in all aspects of security. And so while all aspects of security. And so while all aspects of security. And so while you want to believe in all your heart you want to believe in all your heart you want to believe in all your heart and wishes and dreams that your and wishes and dreams that your and wishes and dreams that your suppliers are are doing right by you suppliers are are doing right by you suppliers are are doing right by you from a vulnerability and license from a vulnerability and license from a vulnerability and license compliance perspective, um you have to compliance perspective, um you have to compliance perspective, um you have to be able to validate that and the more be able to validate that and the more be able to validate that and the more transparent that we are across the transparent that we are across the transparent that we are across the industry, the better our um security industry, the better our um security industry, the better our um security posture will be across the industry as posture will be across the industry as posture will be across the industry as well. well. well. Um I also think it's important to call Um I also think it's important to call Um I also think it's important to call out uh both support status but other out uh both support status but other out uh both support status but other unknown risks as well. And so things unknown risks as well. And so things unknown risks as well. And so things like dependency confusion or typo like dependency confusion or typo like dependency confusion or typo squatting, you'd be surprised how many squatting, you'd be surprised how many squatting, you'd be surprised how many third-party supply chain attacks occur third-party supply chain attacks occur third-party supply chain attacks occur not because of bad code in your first not because of bad code in your first not because of bad code in your first party code, but because of a dependency party code, but because of a dependency party code, but because of a dependency confusion attack that is happening on a confusion attack that is happening on a confusion attack that is happening on a code that you're um bringing in from say code that you're um bringing in from say code that you're um bringing in from say like a supplier's binary or something of like a supplier's binary or something of like a supplier's binary or something of that that that nature. Now let's talk about the nature. Now let's talk about the nature. Now let's talk about the technical challenges. I actually want to technical challenges. I actually want to technical challenges. I actually want to spend a lot of time here because this is spend a lot of time here because this is spend a lot of time here because this is the one that I continue to see the most the one that I continue to see the most the one that I continue to see the most push back from um from an industry push back from um from an industry push back from um from an industry perspective, which is absolutely not perspective, which is absolutely not perspective, which is absolutely not Cortez. cuz I don't want to share my Cortez. cuz I don't want to share my Cortez. cuz I don't want to share my sbombs. Why would I want to do that? I'm sbombs. Why would I want to do that? I'm sbombs. Why would I want to do that? I'm giving threat actors a blueprint for giving threat actors a blueprint for giving threat actors a blueprint for them to be able to tell exactly what them to be able to tell exactly what them to be able to tell exactly what they need to attack to, you know, kind they need to attack to, you know, kind they need to attack to, you know, kind of hack my codebase. I'm giving away my of hack my codebase. I'm giving away my of hack my codebase. I'm giving away my IP. Um, and so you want me to just give IP. Um, and so you want me to just give IP. Um, and so you want me to just give away all this intellectual property, away all this intellectual property, away all this intellectual property, this moat that I've built up over the this moat that I've built up over the this moat that I've built up over the course of, you know, how many decades? course of, you know, how many decades? course of, you know, how many decades? Um, I'm going to call complete Um, I'm going to call complete Um, I'm going to call complete on both of those. Um, very on both of those. Um, very on both of those. Um, very transparently. Um, let's deal with the transparently. Um, let's deal with the transparently. Um, let's deal with the first one. Uh, intellectual property. I first one. Uh, intellectual property. I first one. Uh, intellectual property. I can assure you that if I can reverse can assure you that if I can reverse can assure you that if I can reverse engineer your application by simply engineer your application by simply engineer your application by simply knowing what packages whether that's knowing what packages whether that's knowing what packages whether that's commercial or open- source that you are commercial or open- source that you are commercial or open- source that you are using you have a terrible application using you have a terrible application using you have a terrible application absolutely horrendous and if that is absolutely horrendous and if that is absolutely horrendous and if that is your only mode I can assure you have your only mode I can assure you have your only mode I can assure you have bigger problems as an industry um can I bigger problems as an industry um can I bigger problems as an industry um can I have insight into some of the commercial have insight into some of the commercial have insight into some of the commercial tooling that you're using absolutely um tooling that you're using absolutely um tooling that you're using absolutely um but in any uh modern organization the but in any uh modern organization the but in any uh modern organization the way that you're using these packages way that you're using these packages way that you're using these packages packages, the data that you're packages, the data that you're packages, the data that you're generating um from your customers and generating um from your customers and generating um from your customers and how you're then surfacing that and how you're then surfacing that and how you're then surfacing that and curating that that is your intellectual curating that that is your intellectual curating that that is your intellectual property. Your uses of GIC is not property. Your uses of GIC is not property. Your uses of GIC is not intellectual property. I can assure you intellectual property. I can assure you intellectual property. I can assure you um we're all using jQuery, right? Um, um we're all using jQuery, right? Um, um we're all using jQuery, right? Um, the second one that I think is a massive the second one that I think is a massive the second one that I think is a massive like kind of common misunderstanding like kind of common misunderstanding like kind of common misunderstanding that I if you don't take anything else that I if you don't take anything else that I if you don't take anything else from my talk today, I want you to go from my talk today, I want you to go from my talk today, I want you to go back and champion this in your back and champion this in your back and champion this in your organizations, which is very rarely, I'm organizations, which is very rarely, I'm organizations, which is very rarely, I'm not going to say it's impossible, but not going to say it's impossible, but not going to say it's impossible, but very rarely do thread actors truly do very rarely do thread actors truly do very rarely do thread actors truly do targeted attacks, meaning they're not targeted attacks, meaning they're not targeted attacks, meaning they're not going to go look up your sbomb and say, going to go look up your sbomb and say, going to go look up your sbomb and say, "Okay, great. I know that jQuery is "Okay, great. I know that jQuery is "Okay, great. I know that jQuery is vulnerable with this rce, so I know vulnerable with this rce, so I know vulnerable with this rce, so I know absolutely how I can go ahead and absolutely how I can go ahead and absolutely how I can go ahead and penetrate this organization. Thread penetrate this organization. Thread penetrate this organization. Thread actors tend to take very broad attacks. actors tend to take very broad attacks. actors tend to take very broad attacks. They're going to use absolutely every They're going to use absolutely every They're going to use absolutely every known exploitable vulnerability that is known exploitable vulnerability that is known exploitable vulnerability that is out there at that moment. And they're out there at that moment. And they're out there at that moment. And they're going to try to hit every single one at going to try to hit every single one at going to try to hit every single one at the exact same time. And so your esbomb the exact same time. And so your esbomb the exact same time. And so your esbomb has not given any competitive advantage has not given any competitive advantage has not given any competitive advantage in any way, shape, or form to a threat in any way, shape, or form to a threat in any way, shape, or form to a threat actor from a a vulnerability actor from a a vulnerability actor from a a vulnerability perspective. And I will challenge anyone perspective. And I will challenge anyone perspective. And I will challenge anyone who believes that that is actually the who believes that that is actually the who believes that that is actually the case. I would love to have that case. I would love to have that case. I would love to have that conversation. Now that I've kind of, you conversation. Now that I've kind of, you conversation. Now that I've kind of, you know, pushed back on, I think were some know, pushed back on, I think were some know, pushed back on, I think were some of the kind of big misconceptions um of the kind of big misconceptions um of the kind of big misconceptions um around why people are hesitant to want around why people are hesitant to want around why people are hesitant to want to provide sbombs. If you're a supplier to provide sbombs. If you're a supplier to provide sbombs. If you're a supplier and either you're OEM or you have a tier and either you're OEM or you have a tier and either you're OEM or you have a tier 2 um supplier and you're both supplier 2 um supplier and you're both supplier 2 um supplier and you're both supplier and OEM um and need to be able to and OEM um and need to be able to and OEM um and need to be able to metriculate that down, um there are some metriculate that down, um there are some metriculate that down, um there are some things that you have to be really really things that you have to be really really things that you have to be really really mindful of. um I will keep saying it all mindful of. um I will keep saying it all mindful of. um I will keep saying it all day every day which is unique day every day which is unique day every day which is unique identifiers are king in the sbomb space identifiers are king in the sbomb space identifiers are king in the sbomb space and having accurate component um and having accurate component um and having accurate component um identifiers from a pearl perspective is identifiers from a pearl perspective is identifiers from a pearl perspective is going to be critical for you um and then going to be critical for you um and then going to be critical for you um and then most importantly making sure you have most importantly making sure you have most importantly making sure you have accurate scopes as well from a labeling accurate scopes as well from a labeling accurate scopes as well from a labeling perspective so understanding whe these perspective so understanding whe these perspective so understanding whe these are production dev tests understanding are production dev tests understanding are production dev tests understanding if these are statically linked or if these are statically linked or if these are statically linked or dynamically linked if these are actively dynamically linked if these are actively dynamically linked if these are actively supported or not actively supported supported or not actively supported supported or not actively supported that's going to be the information that that's going to be the information that that's going to be the information that allows for you as an esbomb consumer to allows for you as an esbomb consumer to allows for you as an esbomb consumer to actually then make useful decisions um actually then make useful decisions um actually then make useful decisions um with this with this with this All righty. Um, let's hop into the All righty. Um, let's hop into the All righty. Um, let's hop into the workflow. Um, on this one, I think this workflow. Um, on this one, I think this workflow. Um, on this one, I think this is actually going to be one of the is actually going to be one of the is actually going to be one of the easier workflows. Um, we've already done easier workflows. Um, we've already done easier workflows. Um, we've already done a lot of the upfront work. We've built a lot of the upfront work. We've built a lot of the upfront work. We've built our application level asbomb. We've our application level asbomb. We've our application level asbomb. We've generated that and distributed on a generated that and distributed on a generated that and distributed on a regular basis. We're already ingesting regular basis. We're already ingesting regular basis. We're already ingesting that in some part of the organization as that in some part of the organization as that in some part of the organization as a part of a workflow. And so, we're a part of a workflow. And so, we're a part of a workflow. And so, we're going to kind of pick up there to a going to kind of pick up there to a going to kind of pick up there to a certain extent, right? Which is I am a certain extent, right? Which is I am a certain extent, right? Which is I am a uh tier one supplier. I, you know, work uh tier one supplier. I, you know, work uh tier one supplier. I, you know, work in the automotive space. have to provide in the automotive space. have to provide in the automotive space. have to provide um one of the big you know three um one of the big you know three um one of the big you know three automotive manufacturers an esbomb. How automotive manufacturers an esbomb. How automotive manufacturers an esbomb. How do I do that? All right. So I've already do I do that? All right. So I've already do I do that? All right. So I've already done the work of going through all my done the work of going through all my done the work of going through all my individual repositories. I've curated individual repositories. I've curated individual repositories. I've curated together this application level E sbomb. together this application level E sbomb. together this application level E sbomb. I'm going to then go ahead and share I'm going to then go ahead and share I'm going to then go ahead and share that to the OEM. The OEM is going to that to the OEM. The OEM is going to that to the OEM. The OEM is going to import that sbomb into whatever their import that sbomb into whatever their import that sbomb into whatever their you know tooling of choice is. And you know tooling of choice is. And you know tooling of choice is. And they're going to want to check it for they're going to want to check it for they're going to want to check it for two things. They're going to check it two things. They're going to check it two things. They're going to check it for structural issues from an SBOM for structural issues from an SBOM for structural issues from an SBOM perspective. Meaning is it of the right perspective. Meaning is it of the right perspective. Meaning is it of the right spec that I assume because I prefer spec that I assume because I prefer spec that I assume because I prefer Cyclone DX. So it should be cyclone DX Cyclone DX. So it should be cyclone DX Cyclone DX. So it should be cyclone DX or is it SPDX, right? Um does it have or is it SPDX, right? Um does it have or is it SPDX, right? Um does it have information like the NIA minimum information like the NIA minimum information like the NIA minimum elements, supplier information? Does it elements, supplier information? Does it elements, supplier information? Does it have complete um relationships? That one have complete um relationships? That one have complete um relationships? That one is often often times missed. Um and so is often often times missed. Um and so is often often times missed. Um and so putting a lot of emphasis there. Um does putting a lot of emphasis there. Um does putting a lot of emphasis there. Um does it have um VEX and VDR assertions for it have um VEX and VDR assertions for it have um VEX and VDR assertions for any vulnerabilities that are detected, any vulnerabilities that are detected, any vulnerabilities that are detected, right? So this is all kind of in that right? So this is all kind of in that right? So this is all kind of in that structural aspects of it. And then from structural aspects of it. And then from structural aspects of it. And then from there, once you have the unique there, once you have the unique there, once you have the unique identifiers, you then want to run these identifiers, you then want to run these identifiers, you then want to run these sbombs through the exact same license sbombs through the exact same license sbombs through the exact same license compliance and vulnerability workflow compliance and vulnerability workflow compliance and vulnerability workflow that you use internally. And so you then that you use internally. And so you then that you use internally. And so you then say, okay, great. Of the vulnerabilities say, okay, great. Of the vulnerabilities say, okay, great. Of the vulnerabilities that we detected, how many of these that we detected, how many of these that we detected, how many of these violate our SLA or policies? Are they violate our SLA or policies? Are they violate our SLA or policies? Are they critical high vulnerabilities? Are these critical high vulnerabilities? Are these critical high vulnerabilities? Are these just mediums and lows? And so for just mediums and lows? And so for just mediums and lows? And so for whatever reason, I'm comfortable with whatever reason, I'm comfortable with whatever reason, I'm comfortable with that. Do I have an EPSSbased um that. Do I have an EPSSbased um that. Do I have an EPSSbased um workflow, which I would highly recommend workflow, which I would highly recommend workflow, which I would highly recommend moving towards over a CVSsbased moving towards over a CVSsbased moving towards over a CVSsbased workflow? And then use thresholds there. workflow? And then use thresholds there. workflow? And then use thresholds there. Um, if I do have a vulnerability that is Um, if I do have a vulnerability that is Um, if I do have a vulnerability that is violating, you know, say it's a critical violating, you know, say it's a critical violating, you know, say it's a critical vulnerability that's on the CICV and so vulnerability that's on the CICV and so vulnerability that's on the CICV and so we have an SLA to remediate that in 30 we have an SLA to remediate that in 30 we have an SLA to remediate that in 30 days. Um, I can then look, great, this days. Um, I can then look, great, this days. Um, I can then look, great, this vulnerability exists. Is there a VEX vulnerability exists. Is there a VEX vulnerability exists. Is there a VEX assertion for this? Maybe this supplier assertion for this? Maybe this supplier assertion for this? Maybe this supplier has already told me that they're not has already told me that they're not has already told me that they're not affected by this vulnerability or they affected by this vulnerability or they affected by this vulnerability or they fixed it or they plan to fix it. And fixed it or they plan to fix it. And fixed it or they plan to fix it. And here's a customer service um I'm I'm here's a customer service um I'm I'm here's a customer service um I'm I'm sorry, a customer security advisory um sorry, a customer security advisory um sorry, a customer security advisory um that I can then review which a bunch of that I can then review which a bunch of that I can then review which a bunch of information about that. Um after I've information about that. Um after I've information about that. Um after I've kind of made that um determination, yes, kind of made that um determination, yes, kind of made that um determination, yes, great. I can kind of move on to the next great. I can kind of move on to the next great. I can kind of move on to the next vulnerability. No, then I need that vulnerability. No, then I need that vulnerability. No, then I need that supplier to go back to the drawing board supplier to go back to the drawing board supplier to go back to the drawing board and I need to have an ability to have a and I need to have an ability to have a and I need to have an ability to have a two-way communication with my supplier two-way communication with my supplier two-way communication with my supplier of here's the things that we surface of here's the things that we surface of here's the things that we surface both from a content and a structural both from a content and a structural both from a content and a structural perspective and here's um the time frame perspective and here's um the time frame perspective and here's um the time frame by which that I need you to fix them on. by which that I need you to fix them on. by which that I need you to fix them on. Um something I'll pause here for a Um something I'll pause here for a Um something I'll pause here for a second which is um if you have proper second which is um if you have proper second which is um if you have proper unique identifiers like Pearl, you can unique identifiers like Pearl, you can unique identifiers like Pearl, you can actually fill in the gaps on your actually fill in the gaps on your actually fill in the gaps on your supplers's behalf which is really really supplers's behalf which is really really supplers's behalf which is really really powerful. And so if they don't have, you powerful. And so if they don't have, you powerful. And so if they don't have, you know, supplier information, but that's know, supplier information, but that's know, supplier information, but that's required because you need it for an FDA required because you need it for an FDA required because you need it for an FDA um submission or they don't have um submission or they don't have um submission or they don't have manufacturer information and that's manufacturer information and that's manufacturer information and that's required because you need that for an required because you need that for an required because you need that for an FDA submission, then use your unique FDA submission, then use your unique FDA submission, then use your unique identifiers to enrich that data on their identifiers to enrich that data on their identifiers to enrich that data on their behalf and make sure you're spending the behalf and make sure you're spending the behalf and make sure you're spending the bulk of your time on ensuring that bulk of your time on ensuring that bulk of your time on ensuring that they're not violating your open source they're not violating your open source they're not violating your open source policies, whereas where you're going to policies, whereas where you're going to policies, whereas where you're going to get your largest get your largest get your largest return. After um you've kind of worked return. After um you've kind of worked return. After um you've kind of worked your way um through that cycle, um the your way um through that cycle, um the your way um through that cycle, um the piece that most people forget is that piece that most people forget is that piece that most people forget is that new vulnerabilities come out every day. new vulnerabilities come out every day. new vulnerabilities come out every day. Um, and so you have to have some type of Um, and so you have to have some type of Um, and so you have to have some type of cycle, some type of process to have back cycle, some type of process to have back cycle, some type of process to have back and forth with your suppliers on when a and forth with your suppliers on when a and forth with your suppliers on when a new vulnerability comes out on the exact new vulnerability comes out on the exact new vulnerability comes out on the exact same sbomb. No new packages have been same sbomb. No new packages have been same sbomb. No new packages have been introduced. How are you going to give me introduced. How are you going to give me introduced. How are you going to give me an updated VEX statement on that so I an updated VEX statement on that so I an updated VEX statement on that so I can determine if I'm impacted by it or can determine if I'm impacted by it or can determine if I'm impacted by it or if you're going to go ahead and plan to if you're going to go ahead and plan to if you're going to go ahead and plan to remediate that vulnerability and on what remediate that vulnerability and on what remediate that vulnerability and on what time frame. Finally, you've done all the time frame. Finally, you've done all the time frame. Finally, you've done all the hard work. You've made it through. hard work. You've made it through. hard work. You've made it through. You've generated your espon. You've You've generated your espon. You've You've generated your espon. You've imported it. Your suppliers are, you imported it. Your suppliers are, you imported it. Your suppliers are, you know, tired of being harassed by you. So know, tired of being harassed by you. So know, tired of being harassed by you. So they gave you accurate VEX statements. they gave you accurate VEX statements. they gave you accurate VEX statements. You can now go ahead and combine this You can now go ahead and combine this You can now go ahead and combine this with your internal ESBOMB to produce with your internal ESBOMB to produce with your internal ESBOMB to produce that kind of final artifact that you that kind of final artifact that you that kind of final artifact that you would actually ship, say like an would actually ship, say like an would actually ship, say like an infotainment system into a um um infotainment system into a um um infotainment system into a um um automotive manufacturer and you're off automotive manufacturer and you're off automotive manufacturer and you're off to the races at that point. Most to the races at that point. Most to the races at that point. Most importantly, go ahead and pin that importantly, go ahead and pin that importantly, go ahead and pin that revision after you've combined it revision after you've combined it revision after you've combined it together and then you can support that together and then you can support that together and then you can support that release um kind of moving forward. So release um kind of moving forward. So release um kind of moving forward. So that's going to be your supplier um kind that's going to be your supplier um kind that's going to be your supplier um kind of OEM relationship workflow. That's the of OEM relationship workflow. That's the of OEM relationship workflow. That's the the one most mature organizations in the one most mature organizations in the one most mature organizations in particular the ones who spend a lot of particular the ones who spend a lot of particular the ones who spend a lot of time on that two-way communication so time on that two-way communication so time on that two-way communication so they can talk back and forth. Um just to they can talk back and forth. Um just to they can talk back and forth. Um just to kind of give a bit of a sense of what kind of give a bit of a sense of what kind of give a bit of a sense of what you know like a bad sbomb and a good you know like a bad sbomb and a good you know like a bad sbomb and a good sbomb would kind of look like. You'll sbomb would kind of look like. You'll sbomb would kind of look like. You'll see a lot of red over here on that left see a lot of red over here on that left see a lot of red over here on that left hand side there. We're calling out hand side there. We're calling out hand side there. We're calling out things like oh it's clearly missing things like oh it's clearly missing things like oh it's clearly missing supplier information. It's missing supplier information. It's missing supplier information. It's missing relationship information. It doesn't relationship information. It doesn't relationship information. It doesn't have um an actual accurate vulnerability have um an actual accurate vulnerability have um an actual accurate vulnerability account. Um in this particular case account. Um in this particular case account. Um in this particular case there is though like a unique identifier there is though like a unique identifier there is though like a unique identifier in the case of Pearl. Um and so um the in the case of Pearl. Um and so um the in the case of Pearl. Um and so um the supplier can either fix that information supplier can either fix that information supplier can either fix that information or you can choose to enrich that or you can choose to enrich that or you can choose to enrich that information for you. Um on my right hand information for you. Um on my right hand information for you. Um on my right hand side you can now see the updated version side you can now see the updated version side you can now see the updated version um of that sbomb and this is the um of that sbomb and this is the um of that sbomb and this is the analysis of the sbomb out the sbomb analysis of the sbomb out the sbomb analysis of the sbomb out the sbomb itself. Um that then has allowed for you itself. Um that then has allowed for you itself. Um that then has allowed for you to fill in the gaps. Right? So you've to fill in the gaps. Right? So you've to fill in the gaps. Right? So you've added the supplier information. You've added the supplier information. You've added the supplier information. You've added these relationships. You've added added these relationships. You've added added these relationships. You've added all your VEX assertion. And you'll even all your VEX assertion. And you'll even all your VEX assertion. And you'll even notice that you were able to notice that you were able to notice that you were able to dramatically reduce your vulnerability dramatically reduce your vulnerability dramatically reduce your vulnerability account because you got rid of false account because you got rid of false account because you got rid of false positives and duplicates. positives and duplicates. positives and duplicates. With that, um just want to kind of With that, um just want to kind of With that, um just want to kind of review um some of these uh kind of best review um some of these uh kind of best review um some of these uh kind of best practices on this side, which is I can practices on this side, which is I can practices on this side, which is I can assure you do not want to do this assure you do not want to do this assure you do not want to do this validation manually. And so once again, validation manually. And so once again, validation manually. And so once again, there's all kinds of, you know, free there's all kinds of, you know, free there's all kinds of, you know, free tooling out there. There's commercial tooling out there. There's commercial tooling out there. There's commercial tooling that you can use. Make sure that tooling that you can use. Make sure that tooling that you can use. Make sure that you have a really stringent conversation you have a really stringent conversation you have a really stringent conversation on what your ESPOM policy is both from a on what your ESPOM policy is both from a on what your ESPOM policy is both from a structure and then like a content or structure and then like a content or structure and then like a content or assessment uh perspective. Oftentimes assessment uh perspective. Oftentimes assessment uh perspective. Oftentimes people a lot of emphasis on the people a lot of emphasis on the people a lot of emphasis on the structure, right? Use the anti minimum structure, right? Use the anti minimum structure, right? Use the anti minimum elements. Those are great, but those are elements. Those are great, but those are elements. Those are great, but those are insufficient. Make sure that you spend a insufficient. Make sure that you spend a insufficient. Make sure that you spend a lot of time on the assessment piece on lot of time on the assessment piece on lot of time on the assessment piece on making sure that they're not violating making sure that they're not violating making sure that they're not violating your open source policies um internally. your open source policies um internally. your open source policies um internally. Um find secure ways to transmit these Um find secure ways to transmit these Um find secure ways to transmit these sbombs as well. Um if you're emailing sbombs as well. Um if you're emailing sbombs as well. Um if you're emailing your sbombs now I have security concerns your sbombs now I have security concerns your sbombs now I have security concerns for you, right? Like I I I promise you for you, right? Like I I I promise you for you, right? Like I I I promise you that is not the way that you want to go that is not the way that you want to go that is not the way that you want to go about doing it. Um whether you're about doing it. Um whether you're about doing it. Um whether you're hosting your own portal and you want to hosting your own portal and you want to hosting your own portal and you want to distribute this along binaries that distribute this along binaries that distribute this along binaries that you're distributing to your customers, I you're distributing to your customers, I you're distributing to your customers, I think that's great. Um there's all kinds think that's great. Um there's all kinds think that's great. Um there's all kinds of tooling that you can use for say of tooling that you can use for say of tooling that you can use for say things like timebased access controls things like timebased access controls things like timebased access controls and have stringent arback if you'd like and have stringent arback if you'd like and have stringent arback if you'd like to limit the amount of time that someone to limit the amount of time that someone to limit the amount of time that someone has access um to these things. Um and has access um to these things. Um and has access um to these things. Um and then finally um just make sure that then finally um just make sure that then finally um just make sure that you're combining your internal uh you're combining your internal uh you're combining your internal uh application data with that external data application data with that external data application data with that external data coming from the supplier because you do coming from the supplier because you do coming from the supplier because you do want to make sure that you can pin and want to make sure that you can pin and want to make sure that you can pin and monitor the actual final artifact that monitor the actual final artifact that monitor the actual final artifact that is going to whatever your customers are is going to whatever your customers are is going to whatever your customers are using and you don't have to then reverse using and you don't have to then reverse using and you don't have to then reverse engineer that information later. engineer that information later. engineer that information later. With that said, um I tried to do it in With that said, um I tried to do it in With that said, um I tried to do it in 45 minutes was my goal. I think I'm 45 minutes was my goal. I think I'm 45 minutes was my goal. I think I'm right at time there and so I threw a right at time there and so I threw a right at time there and so I threw a bunch at you. If you have any questions, bunch at you. If you have any questions, bunch at you. If you have any questions, I'm happy to answer them now. Um if not, I'm happy to answer them now. Um if not, I'm happy to answer them now. Um if not, I'll be around a little bit after the I'll be around a little bit after the I'll be around a little bit after the talk. So, what do we got? talk. So, what do we got? talk. So, what do we got? Question up front. What you got, my Question up front. What you got, my Question up front. What you got, my friend? Okay. Yeah. No. Awesome. Thank you. Yeah. No. Awesome. Thank you. Yeah. No. Awesome. Thank you. Yeah. Thanks uh for the talk. Um I have Yeah. Thanks uh for the talk. Um I have Yeah. Thanks uh for the talk. Um I have a question. You mentioned several time a question. You mentioned several time a question. You mentioned several time uh the fact you do this association uh the fact you do this association uh the fact you do this association between SBOM and P URL and CP and between SBOM and P URL and CP and between SBOM and P URL and CP and whatever. Yep. Does it means the tools whatever. Yep. Does it means the tools whatever. Yep. Does it means the tools who are generate this sbomb file already who are generate this sbomb file already who are generate this sbomb file already include this kind of information or is include this kind of information or is include this kind of information or is that another tool we make this that another tool we make this that another tool we make this association? Yeah, that's a great association? Yeah, that's a great association? Yeah, that's a great question. Um, the answer is not as question. Um, the answer is not as question. Um, the answer is not as clean, which means it depends, right? clean, which means it depends, right? clean, which means it depends, right? And so, um, for package managed And so, um, for package managed And so, um, for package managed languages, right, if you're doing things languages, right, if you're doing things languages, right, if you're doing things like a Maven clean install, npm install, like a Maven clean install, npm install, like a Maven clean install, npm install, typically most of that tooling is going typically most of that tooling is going typically most of that tooling is going to include a package URL because I think to include a package URL because I think to include a package URL because I think it's kind of easy to understand. You can it's kind of easy to understand. You can it's kind of easy to understand. You can see that's coming from the Maven see that's coming from the Maven see that's coming from the Maven registry, coming from the npm registry, registry, coming from the npm registry, registry, coming from the npm registry, all that kind of good stuff. Um, it all that kind of good stuff. Um, it all that kind of good stuff. Um, it becomes much more complex when you start becomes much more complex when you start becomes much more complex when you start to get into embedded systems and to get into embedded systems and to get into embedded systems and embedded devices. If you're using like embedded devices. If you're using like embedded devices. If you're using like Yakto and Buildroot and Free Arts and Yakto and Buildroot and Free Arts and Yakto and Buildroot and Free Arts and some of these other systems, it's kind some of these other systems, it's kind some of these other systems, it's kind of hit or miss on whether that pearl is of hit or miss on whether that pearl is of hit or miss on whether that pearl is going to be included. Um, oftentimes going to be included. Um, oftentimes going to be included. Um, oftentimes they will include a CPE. Um, the they will include a CPE. Um, the they will include a CPE. Um, the challenge there is that CPE could be challenge there is that CPE could be challenge there is that CPE could be hallucinated, meaning it's not actually hallucinated, meaning it's not actually hallucinated, meaning it's not actually real or doesn't already exist on the real or doesn't already exist on the real or doesn't already exist on the MVD. And so you have to hope and pray MVD. And so you have to hope and pray MVD. And so you have to hope and pray that when the MVD is updated with the that when the MVD is updated with the that when the MVD is updated with the CPE that it's going to match up to the CPE that it's going to match up to the CPE that it's going to match up to the one that they're hallucinating. Um, and one that they're hallucinating. Um, and one that they're hallucinating. Um, and so it's it's definitely a challenge so it's it's definitely a challenge so it's it's definitely a challenge depending on what your tech stack is. depending on what your tech stack is. depending on what your tech stack is. Um, and that's why it's important to put Um, and that's why it's important to put Um, and that's why it's important to put it in your policy. So that way you kind it in your policy. So that way you kind it in your policy. So that way you kind of put the burden on whoever um of put the burden on whoever um of put the burden on whoever um developer is generating that um to kind developer is generating that um to kind developer is generating that um to kind of combine the build tooling itself with of combine the build tooling itself with of combine the build tooling itself with maybe some scripting on their end where maybe some scripting on their end where maybe some scripting on their end where necessary um to be able to fill in the necessary um to be able to fill in the necessary um to be able to fill in the gaps on that one. So yeah, it's it's gaps on that one. So yeah, it's it's gaps on that one. So yeah, it's it's it's a bit of the wild wild west right it's a bit of the wild wild west right it's a bit of the wild wild west right now. now. now. It's a great question. Hi Cortez. Um anyway, thank you. That was a great Um anyway, thank you. That was a great Um anyway, thank you. That was a great talk. I um you know Esbomb's in the real talk. I um you know Esbomb's in the real talk. I um you know Esbomb's in the real world and I'm just curious. Yep. So I'm world and I'm just curious. Yep. So I'm world and I'm just curious. Yep. So I'm I'm working in that space both from a I'm working in that space both from a I'm working in that space both from a supplier a large company with a many supplier a large company with a many supplier a large company with a many software offerings. So both a supplier software offerings. So both a supplier software offerings. So both a supplier as well as a consumer. as well as a consumer. as well as a consumer. Um we have a a rather conservative Um we have a a rather conservative Um we have a a rather conservative approach right that we approach right that we approach right that we are in the real world. What I what I are in the real world. What I what I are in the real world. What I what I find sort of fascinating is it's we come find sort of fascinating is it's we come find sort of fascinating is it's we come here and and using sort of advanced here and and using sort of advanced here and and using sort of advanced tooling, it makes it sound like tooling, it makes it sound like tooling, it makes it sound like everybody is able to generate the means. everybody is able to generate the means. everybody is able to generate the means. We know what's just production code We know what's just production code We know what's just production code verse dev and test are are the people verse dev and test are are the people verse dev and test are are the people requesting them know how to consume them requesting them know how to consume them requesting them know how to consume them beyond just a procurement exercise. Um, beyond just a procurement exercise. Um, beyond just a procurement exercise. Um, but I'm just curious if you have any but I'm just curious if you have any but I'm just curious if you have any stats too. Like so for one, I mean we're stats too. Like so for one, I mean we're stats too. Like so for one, I mean we're always we obviously will have a always we obviously will have a always we obviously will have a difference of opinion, but we're difference of opinion, but we're difference of opinion, but we're very hesitant or we shall I say before very hesitant or we shall I say before very hesitant or we shall I say before we generate an SBOM and send it out to a we generate an SBOM and send it out to a we generate an SBOM and send it out to a client, we are working carefully with client, we are working carefully with client, we are working carefully with the development teams to remediate and the development teams to remediate and the development teams to remediate and make sure because that sbomb leaves make sure because that sbomb leaves make sure because that sbomb leaves nowhere to hide, right? On quality of nowhere to hide, right? On quality of nowhere to hide, right? On quality of your code, potentially the your code, potentially the your code, potentially the vulnerabilities. our legal team is all vulnerabilities. our legal team is all vulnerabilities. our legal team is all over that stuff. Like no way are we over that stuff. Like no way are we over that stuff. Like no way are we going to disclose this stuff until it's going to disclose this stuff until it's going to disclose this stuff until it's fixed. Um and then I'm just curious if fixed. Um and then I'm just curious if fixed. Um and then I'm just curious if you know from you know from you know from the from the other side like we I would the from the other side like we I would the from the other side like we I would say 80% of what I send out. Yep. People say 80% of what I send out. Yep. People say 80% of what I send out. Yep. People have no idea what to do with it. Yes. I have no idea what to do with it. Yes. I have no idea what to do with it. Yes. I mean and granted if they're working with mean and granted if they're working with mean and granted if they're working with an awesome platform tool like Fauca, an awesome platform tool like Fauca, an awesome platform tool like Fauca, that's a different matter. But but I'm that's a different matter. But but I'm that's a different matter. But but I'm finding finding finding most people most people most people I I'd say 80% of the people we're I I'd say 80% of the people we're I I'd say 80% of the people we're working with have no idea what it is. working with have no idea what it is. working with have no idea what it is. And then I get the question back, wait, And then I get the question back, wait, And then I get the question back, wait, I thought it was going to be a human I thought it was going to be a human I thought it was going to be a human readable file, right? So I'm just readable file, right? So I'm just readable file, right? So I'm just curious some of your your thoughts on curious some of your your thoughts on curious some of your your thoughts on that real world angle. Maybe I'm too that real world angle. Maybe I'm too that real world angle. Maybe I'm too simple in the world, but that's the simple in the world, but that's the simple in the world, but that's the world we're living in, right? Super world we're living in, right? Super world we're living in, right? Super challenging that way. No, no, I actually challenging that way. No, no, I actually challenging that way. No, no, I actually echo um a lot of your sentiments. It's echo um a lot of your sentiments. It's echo um a lot of your sentiments. It's actually interesting, too, because I'll actually interesting, too, because I'll actually interesting, too, because I'll decouple customers versus government decouple customers versus government decouple customers versus government organizations. You know, you would think organizations. You know, you would think organizations. You know, you would think that uh if the FDA um put a mandate out that uh if the FDA um put a mandate out that uh if the FDA um put a mandate out that they have to supply sbombs that that they have to supply sbombs that that they have to supply sbombs that they had a plan to do something with they had a plan to do something with they had a plan to do something with them. Uh fun fact, they do not. Um maybe them. Uh fun fact, they do not. Um maybe them. Uh fun fact, they do not. Um maybe they have a plan coming up. I apologize they have a plan coming up. I apologize they have a plan coming up. I apologize if any of my FDA friends um are on the if any of my FDA friends um are on the if any of my FDA friends um are on the call. Um but at least initially, it's call. Um but at least initially, it's call. Um but at least initially, it's kind of a you know, check the block. We kind of a you know, check the block. We kind of a you know, check the block. We want to make sure we have these sbombs want to make sure we have these sbombs want to make sure we have these sbombs so we can reference them later. Um and so we can reference them later. Um and so we can reference them later. Um and in my ideal world, they would be in my ideal world, they would be in my ideal world, they would be immediately importing those into some immediately importing those into some immediately importing those into some tool because that's the only way you tool because that's the only way you tool because that's the only way you start to actually reap the value. Now, start to actually reap the value. Now, start to actually reap the value. Now, my understanding is I think they're my understanding is I think they're my understanding is I think they're working on building something now and so working on building something now and so working on building something now and so that maturity level is starting to get that maturity level is starting to get that maturity level is starting to get there. Um, but you're 100% spot on that there. Um, but you're 100% spot on that there. Um, but you're 100% spot on that I'd say if I were to put a statistic out I'd say if I were to put a statistic out I'd say if I were to put a statistic out there, 90% of organizations do not have there, 90% of organizations do not have there, 90% of organizations do not have a means today to actually import sbombs a means today to actually import sbombs a means today to actually import sbombs and monitor them on a regular basis. And and monitor them on a regular basis. And and monitor them on a regular basis. And I find that to be like a pretty critical I find that to be like a pretty critical I find that to be like a pretty critical fall because the reality is the burden fall because the reality is the burden fall because the reality is the burden that you put in particular if you're that you put in particular if you're that you put in particular if you're like a uh an OEM putting this burden on like a uh an OEM putting this burden on like a uh an OEM putting this burden on your supplier to generate high quality your supplier to generate high quality your supplier to generate high quality sbombs alluding to that legal review sbombs alluding to that legal review sbombs alluding to that legal review process that you asserted earlier process that you asserted earlier process that you asserted earlier ensuring that all of your ensuring that all of your ensuring that all of your vulnerabilities have some type of vex at vulnerabilities have some type of vex at vulnerabilities have some type of vex at astation associated with it. That is astation associated with it. That is astation associated with it. That is intensive. That is extremely resource intensive. That is extremely resource intensive. That is extremely resource intensive. And I feel that we are intensive. And I feel that we are intensive. And I feel that we are actually doing a disservice to the actually doing a disservice to the actually doing a disservice to the industry by not then actually trying to industry by not then actually trying to industry by not then actually trying to reap the benefits of all that upfront reap the benefits of all that upfront reap the benefits of all that upfront work. I would actually go as far to say work. I would actually go as far to say work. I would actually go as far to say that if organizations do not intend to that if organizations do not intend to that if organizations do not intend to import an SBOM and actually do something import an SBOM and actually do something import an SBOM and actually do something with it, then they should not ask for with it, then they should not ask for with it, then they should not ask for them um in the first place. And that them um in the first place. And that them um in the first place. And that that may be an unpopular opinion. And so that may be an unpopular opinion. And so that may be an unpopular opinion. And so 100% that's what I'm seeing out there um 100% that's what I'm seeing out there um 100% that's what I'm seeing out there um in the industry, but that 10% is in the industry, but that 10% is in the industry, but that 10% is growing. I would say that was probably growing. I would say that was probably growing. I would say that was probably 1% a year ago, right? That was and so 1% a year ago, right? That was and so 1% a year ago, right? That was and so now we're at 10% of organizations that now we're at 10% of organizations that now we're at 10% of organizations that can actually do something with this. And can actually do something with this. And can actually do something with this. And so I think we are starting to reach the so I think we are starting to reach the so I think we are starting to reach the point where both sides have to meet in point where both sides have to meet in point where both sides have to meet in the middle. Um those who are producing the middle. Um those who are producing the middle. Um those who are producing sbombs have to become more comfortable sbombs have to become more comfortable sbombs have to become more comfortable with being a little bit more with being a little bit more with being a little bit more transparent. Right? You know, you didn't transparent. Right? You know, you didn't transparent. Right? You know, you didn't necessarily say this explicitly, but necessarily say this explicitly, but necessarily say this explicitly, but reading through the lines a little bit reading through the lines a little bit reading through the lines a little bit oftent times you see organizations that oftent times you see organizations that oftent times you see organizations that are afraid to put out an SBOM until are afraid to put out an SBOM until are afraid to put out an SBOM until they've, you know, 100% triaged it. The they've, you know, 100% triaged it. The they've, you know, 100% triaged it. The reality is new vulnerabilities are going reality is new vulnerabilities are going reality is new vulnerabilities are going to keep coming out. You're probably to keep coming out. You're probably to keep coming out. You're probably going to miss stuff. And so you're going to miss stuff. And so you're going to miss stuff. And so you're better off being able to have that better off being able to have that better off being able to have that continuous communication rather than continuous communication rather than continuous communication rather than holding back your sbomb until it's kind holding back your sbomb until it's kind holding back your sbomb until it's kind of reached that complete point. And then of reached that complete point. And then of reached that complete point. And then I think consumers of esbomb have a lot I think consumers of esbomb have a lot I think consumers of esbomb have a lot of work to do frankly um to be able to of work to do frankly um to be able to of work to do frankly um to be able to figure out how they're actually going to figure out how they're actually going to figure out how they're actually going to feed those into their um you know feed those into their um you know feed those into their um you know broader vulnerability management broader vulnerability management broader vulnerability management program. So um hopefully a year from now program. So um hopefully a year from now program. So um hopefully a year from now um that position will change. Absolutely brilliant presentation. Thank Absolutely brilliant presentation. Thank Absolutely brilliant presentation. Thank you so much. I I learned a lot. Uh I I you so much. I I learned a lot. Uh I I you so much. I I learned a lot. Uh I I work on the vulnerability metadata side work on the vulnerability metadata side work on the vulnerability metadata side of the house. So nice. And I'm an of the house. So nice. And I'm an of the house. So nice. And I'm an experiential learner. So I've gotten experiential learner. So I've gotten experiential learner. So I've gotten sbombs in the abstract, but stuff like sbombs in the abstract, but stuff like sbombs in the abstract, but stuff like this is really helpful for people like this is really helpful for people like this is really helpful for people like me to be able to get a bit more concrete me to be able to get a bit more concrete me to be able to get a bit more concrete understanding. Um absolutely. I feel understanding. Um absolutely. I feel understanding. Um absolutely. I feel like we're at the very beginning of the like we're at the very beginning of the like we're at the very beginning of the the sbomb maturity adoption uptake sort the sbomb maturity adoption uptake sort the sbomb maturity adoption uptake sort of style. You know, we're still having of style. You know, we're still having of style. You know, we're still having these conversations around vendors being these conversations around vendors being these conversations around vendors being very nervous very nervous very nervous about providing an SBOM and about it about providing an SBOM and about it about providing an SBOM and about it being kind of the secret source to a being kind of the secret source to a being kind of the secret source to a degree or or just not something that degree or or just not something that degree or or just not something that they're necessarily proud of, right? they're necessarily proud of, right? they're necessarily proud of, right? Like we've got to get to that point of Like we've got to get to that point of Like we've got to get to that point of you you pick up a a bottle of ketchup, you you pick up a a bottle of ketchup, you you pick up a a bottle of ketchup, you know what's in it, right? Like you know what's in it, right? Like you know what's in it, right? Like that's very normalized, right? Um the Biden executive order Um the Biden executive order Um the Biden executive order around supply chain security was part of around supply chain security was part of around supply chain security was part of what's putting momentum behind that. Is what's putting momentum behind that. Is what's putting momentum behind that. Is that likely to then derail under a new that likely to then derail under a new that likely to then derail under a new administration, do you think, or or administration, do you think, or or administration, do you think, or or Yeah. Can we can we maintain momentum to Yeah. Can we can we maintain momentum to Yeah. Can we can we maintain momentum to avoid a a um regression? Yeah, that avoid a a um regression? Yeah, that avoid a a um regression? Yeah, that that's a great question. Um actually, that's a great question. Um actually, that's a great question. Um actually, and I love this question. And I'll I'll and I love this question. And I'll I'll and I love this question. And I'll I'll kind of give you a few thoughts um on kind of give you a few thoughts um on kind of give you a few thoughts um on it. Um first and foremost, my my strong it. Um first and foremost, my my strong it. Um first and foremost, my my strong opinion is that the cat's out the bag opinion is that the cat's out the bag opinion is that the cat's out the bag now. And I think it's going to be really now. And I think it's going to be really now. And I think it's going to be really difficult uh to rein that back in. And difficult uh to rein that back in. And difficult uh to rein that back in. And I'll I'll tell you why I share that I'll I'll tell you why I share that I'll I'll tell you why I share that opinion. Um because esbombs are so opinion. Um because esbombs are so opinion. Um because esbombs are so interesting to me because I I truly view interesting to me because I I truly view interesting to me because I I truly view them view them as a vehicle, right? them view them as a vehicle, right? them view them as a vehicle, right? Similar on the investment side, whether Similar on the investment side, whether Similar on the investment side, whether you want to put your investment in your you want to put your investment in your you want to put your investment in your 401k, your Roth IRA, a personal account, 401k, your Roth IRA, a personal account, 401k, your Roth IRA, a personal account, these are all various vehicles for you these are all various vehicles for you these are all various vehicles for you to make money. And I view sbombs as to make money. And I view sbombs as to make money. And I view sbombs as essentially various vehicles for you to essentially various vehicles for you to essentially various vehicles for you to communicate um software supply chain communicate um software supply chain communicate um software supply chain risk. Now before the executive order, risk. Now before the executive order, risk. Now before the executive order, most of us were actually already doing most of us were actually already doing most of us were actually already doing sbombs. We called them Excel sheets. Um sbombs. We called them Excel sheets. Um sbombs. We called them Excel sheets. Um and so it's it's not actually, you know, and so it's it's not actually, you know, and so it's it's not actually, you know, that necessarily new or or novel of of a that necessarily new or or novel of of a that necessarily new or or novel of of a concept um as much as it is just putting concept um as much as it is just putting concept um as much as it is just putting it into a structured format that is, you it into a structured format that is, you it into a structured format that is, you know, machine readable. So that way we know, machine readable. So that way we know, machine readable. So that way we can kind of deal with these things can kind of deal with these things can kind of deal with these things better at scale in a way that CSVs, you better at scale in a way that CSVs, you better at scale in a way that CSVs, you know, immediately fall over. And so know, immediately fall over. And so know, immediately fall over. And so that's the thing that makes me excited that's the thing that makes me excited that's the thing that makes me excited because I think that it has become clear because I think that it has become clear because I think that it has become clear for any modern organization that this for any modern organization that this for any modern organization that this black box is no longer acceptable. It it black box is no longer acceptable. It it black box is no longer acceptable. It it cannot be acceptable. I just have no cannot be acceptable. I just have no cannot be acceptable. I just have no idea what my suppliers are using. And so idea what my suppliers are using. And so idea what my suppliers are using. And so whether I make them fill out a form, whether I make them fill out a form, whether I make them fill out a form, which is what a lot of people are doing, which is what a lot of people are doing, which is what a lot of people are doing, whether I make them submit an Excel whether I make them submit an Excel whether I make them submit an Excel sheet or they submit a Cyclone DX SBOM, sheet or they submit a Cyclone DX SBOM, sheet or they submit a Cyclone DX SBOM, I think this um momentum around that I think this um momentum around that I think this um momentum around that transparency piece is kind of too far transparency piece is kind of too far transparency piece is kind of too far regardless of what the um regardless of what the um regardless of what the um administrations um say. Now, with that administrations um say. Now, with that administrations um say. Now, with that said, I do um suspect that the push will said, I do um suspect that the push will said, I do um suspect that the push will now need to come from the commercial now need to come from the commercial now need to come from the commercial side of the house and not from the um side of the house and not from the um side of the house and not from the um the government side of the house in the the government side of the house in the the government side of the house in the same ways that it was before. I can see same ways that it was before. I can see same ways that it was before. I can see that that push beginning to slow down that that push beginning to slow down that that push beginning to slow down under the new new administration. And so under the new new administration. And so under the new new administration. And so I think it's even more critical now for I think it's even more critical now for I think it's even more critical now for all of us in this kind of community um all of us in this kind of community um all of us in this kind of community um to recognize that the more transparent to recognize that the more transparent to recognize that the more transparent we are the better the whole industry we are the better the whole industry we are the better the whole industry will be. Thank you. Is this on? I guess so. All Thank you. Is this on? I guess so. All Thank you. Is this on? I guess so. All right. Stay with your chess. All right. right. Stay with your chess. All right. right. Stay with your chess. All right. Uh my question was do can you talk about Uh my question was do can you talk about Uh my question was do can you talk about some strategies of generating sbombs at some strategies of generating sbombs at some strategies of generating sbombs at build time like in the pipeline like build time like in the pipeline like build time like in the pipeline like what are the approaches of doing it? what are the approaches of doing it? what are the approaches of doing it? Yes that is a great question. Um so I'm Yes that is a great question. Um so I'm Yes that is a great question. Um so I'm a big fan of uh generating sbombs during a big fan of uh generating sbombs during a big fan of uh generating sbombs during build time. Um the reason being is build time. Um the reason being is build time. Um the reason being is because source sbombs are oftentimes because source sbombs are oftentimes because source sbombs are oftentimes wildly insufficient right and so um wildly insufficient right and so um wildly insufficient right and so um you'll see a lot of um out there where you'll see a lot of um out there where you'll see a lot of um out there where you'll take like a pom.xml XML file or you'll take like a pom.xml XML file or you'll take like a pom.xml XML file or like a package JSON you'll say okay like a package JSON you'll say okay like a package JSON you'll say okay great I see that these you know 10 great I see that these you know 10 great I see that these you know 10 dependencies are being asserted here and dependencies are being asserted here and dependencies are being asserted here and so this is my full dependency graph that so this is my full dependency graph that so this is my full dependency graph that is not your full dependency graph that is not your full dependency graph that is not your full dependency graph that is probably the tip of the iceberg right is probably the tip of the iceberg right is probably the tip of the iceberg right and so by doing it at build time after and so by doing it at build time after and so by doing it at build time after you've done your npm install your Maven you've done your npm install your Maven you've done your npm install your Maven install whatever it is you've done your install whatever it is you've done your install whatever it is you've done your YTO build you've done your build route YTO build you've done your build route YTO build you've done your build route build you now have as close as possible build you now have as close as possible build you now have as close as possible to that final artifact um and I the to that final artifact um and I the to that final artifact um and I the biggest benefit for me is the dependency biggest benefit for me is the dependency biggest benefit for me is the dependency relationships that is one of the like relationships that is one of the like relationships that is one of the like least appreciated aspects of the sbomb least appreciated aspects of the sbomb least appreciated aspects of the sbomb is full dependency graph that has you is full dependency graph that has you is full dependency graph that has you know for this dependency A that brings know for this dependency A that brings know for this dependency A that brings in B that brings in C that brings in D I in B that brings in C that brings in D I in B that brings in C that brings in D I need to be able to go through that chain need to be able to go through that chain need to be able to go through that chain in particular because if I want to make in particular because if I want to make in particular because if I want to make any impact to a transitive dependency any impact to a transitive dependency any impact to a transitive dependency very very frequently those are actually very very frequently those are actually very very frequently those are actually being brought in by multiple direct being brought in by multiple direct being brought in by multiple direct dependencies and so you will reach a dependencies and so you will reach a dependencies and so you will reach a false level of security if you only have false level of security if you only have false level of security if you only have the one dependency graph if you will and the one dependency graph if you will and the one dependency graph if you will and because you're going to think great I because you're going to think great I because you're going to think great I just upgrade dependency A and that will just upgrade dependency A and that will just upgrade dependency A and that will help me remediate vulnerability and help me remediate vulnerability and help me remediate vulnerability and dependency D, but the reality is dependency D, but the reality is dependency D, but the reality is dependency D is also being brought in by dependency D is also being brought in by dependency D is also being brought in by dependency F. And so you have to upgrade dependency F. And so you have to upgrade dependency F. And so you have to upgrade a combination of A and F in this a combination of A and F in this a combination of A and F in this hypothetical scenario in order to kind hypothetical scenario in order to kind hypothetical scenario in order to kind of reach that point. Um I think from a of reach that point. Um I think from a of reach that point. Um I think from a strategy perspective um speed is going strategy perspective um speed is going strategy perspective um speed is going to be the name of the game. Um because to be the name of the game. Um because to be the name of the game. Um because if you uh are doing something NCI, the if you uh are doing something NCI, the if you uh are doing something NCI, the biggest fear um that you're going to biggest fear um that you're going to biggest fear um that you're going to have there is that you fail a build for have there is that you fail a build for have there is that you fail a build for something that has nothing to do with something that has nothing to do with something that has nothing to do with the developer problems, right? They the developer problems, right? They the developer problems, right? They like, oh god, you got this, you know, like, oh god, you got this, you know, like, oh god, you got this, you know, shitty CLI tool in here and it's just shitty CLI tool in here and it's just shitty CLI tool in here and it's just making my life worse. What do I do about making my life worse. What do I do about making my life worse. What do I do about that? And so I think there's ways that I that? And so I think there's ways that I that? And so I think there's ways that I I would actually encourage um or what we I would actually encourage um or what we I would actually encourage um or what we encourage our customer base to do is to encourage our customer base to do is to encourage our customer base to do is to have almost two pipelines, right? So you have almost two pipelines, right? So you have almost two pipelines, right? So you have your build system that kicks off have your build system that kicks off have your build system that kicks off your um CI/CD deployment. Separately to your um CI/CD deployment. Separately to your um CI/CD deployment. Separately to that, you can then run your scan with that, you can then run your scan with that, you can then run your scan with whatever your SCA tooling is because whatever your SCA tooling is because whatever your SCA tooling is because that process can be a little bit more that process can be a little bit more that process can be a little bit more strenuous in particular if you're doing strenuous in particular if you're doing strenuous in particular if you're doing like binary um decomposition, which can like binary um decomposition, which can like binary um decomposition, which can be a multi-hour process depending on how be a multi-hour process depending on how be a multi-hour process depending on how complicated your binary is. So, don't complicated your binary is. So, don't complicated your binary is. So, don't block your builds um based off of your block your builds um based off of your block your builds um based off of your Sbomb generation. Have those builds go Sbomb generation. Have those builds go Sbomb generation. Have those builds go through. Kick off the Sbomb generation through. Kick off the Sbomb generation through. Kick off the Sbomb generation right after that build time. Have that right after that build time. Have that right after that build time. Have that process go through whatever um efforts process go through whatever um efforts process go through whatever um efforts that it needs. Um and then most that it needs. Um and then most that it needs. Um and then most importantly, make sure that you're doing importantly, make sure that you're doing importantly, make sure that you're doing it for all of the tooling that's being it for all of the tooling that's being it for all of the tooling that's being captured there. Um, I think that's the captured there. Um, I think that's the captured there. Um, I think that's the last piece that is oftentimes missed, last piece that is oftentimes missed, last piece that is oftentimes missed, which is if I have, you know, a which is if I have, you know, a which is if I have, you know, a JavaScript app, a Java app, I got, um, JavaScript app, a Java app, I got, um, JavaScript app, a Java app, I got, um, you know, something that I'm then you know, something that I'm then you know, something that I'm then combining on a container for a a Linux combining on a container for a a Linux combining on a container for a a Linux ecosystem, I want to scan on the ecosystem, I want to scan on the ecosystem, I want to scan on the container side of that. So that way I container side of that. So that way I container side of that. So that way I get the both the JavaScript, the Java, get the both the JavaScript, the Java, get the both the JavaScript, the Java, and the Linux dependencies all in one and the Linux dependencies all in one and the Linux dependencies all in one sbomb. And I may have to do that in sbomb. And I may have to do that in sbomb. And I may have to do that in chunks in order to combine it together chunks in order to combine it together chunks in order to combine it together if I don't have tooling that covers all if I don't have tooling that covers all if I don't have tooling that covers all those languages at the same times. So those languages at the same times. So those languages at the same times. So that's going to be the biggest challenge that's going to be the biggest challenge that's going to be the biggest challenge that you run into. But I absolutely that you run into. But I absolutely that you run into. But I absolutely advocate for build time. I think it's advocate for build time. I think it's advocate for build time. I think it's better than runtime. Um, once again better than runtime. Um, once again better than runtime. Um, once again going back to the relationships, you going back to the relationships, you going back to the relationships, you cannot get accurate relationships and if cannot get accurate relationships and if cannot get accurate relationships and if someone says they can get accurate someone says they can get accurate someone says they can get accurate relationships and runtime, they are relationships and runtime, they are relationships and runtime, they are lying to you. Um, they can make some lying to you. Um, they can make some lying to you. Um, they can make some guesses at best, but you cannot get that guesses at best, but you cannot get that guesses at best, but you cannot get that 100%. 100%. 100%. So um, I think we had a one more So um, I think we had a one more So um, I think we had a one more question up this way or Oh, perfect. question up this way or Oh, perfect. question up this way or Oh, perfect. Yeah, thank you for the talk. So, so u Yeah, thank you for the talk. So, so u Yeah, thank you for the talk. So, so u my question goes into the uh the my question goes into the uh the my question goes into the uh the direction of kind of you show that now direction of kind of you show that now direction of kind of you show that now with uh kind of with uh kind of with uh kind of a uh source code based uh approach kind a uh source code based uh approach kind a uh source code based uh approach kind of with canoe as a framework and kind of of with canoe as a framework and kind of of with canoe as a framework and kind of a developer portal frameworks like a developer portal frameworks like a developer portal frameworks like backstage where this is kind of open- backstage where this is kind of open- backstage where this is kind of open- source frameworks for developer portals source frameworks for developer portals source frameworks for developer portals that are kind of closed in itself. So that are kind of closed in itself. So that are kind of closed in itself. So basically you do uh during uh build time basically you do uh during uh build time basically you do uh during uh build time the sbomb generation you kind of have the sbomb generation you kind of have the sbomb generation you kind of have everything mapped together. Y but kind everything mapped together. Y but kind everything mapped together. Y but kind of from from your perspective what is it of from from your perspective what is it of from from your perspective what is it or what can we do in order to basically or what can we do in order to basically or what can we do in order to basically bridge that gap between the source code bridge that gap between the source code bridge that gap between the source code generation of all that data and the generation of all that data and the generation of all that data and the runtime operations of that data. Kind of runtime operations of that data. Kind of runtime operations of that data. Kind of the CVE framework now has this uh 422 the CVE framework now has this uh 422 the CVE framework now has this uh 422 you should have vulnerabilities on you should have vulnerabilities on you should have vulnerabilities on cloud. Um, so how do we bridge the gap cloud. Um, so how do we bridge the gap cloud. Um, so how do we bridge the gap and enable, for example, scanner vendors and enable, for example, scanner vendors and enable, for example, scanner vendors to leverage that information? to leverage that information? to leverage that information? Yep. No, this is a great question. I Yep. No, this is a great question. I Yep. No, this is a great question. I absolutely love this one. Um, I have an absolutely love this one. Um, I have an absolutely love this one. Um, I have an opinion on what I think the answer is. I opinion on what I think the answer is. I opinion on what I think the answer is. I I don't know if this is the correct one I don't know if this is the correct one I don't know if this is the correct one or not, but um, in my ideal world, you or not, but um, in my ideal world, you or not, but um, in my ideal world, you would actually be required to generate would actually be required to generate would actually be required to generate an SBOM at every stage of the SDLC. And an SBOM at every stage of the SDLC. And an SBOM at every stage of the SDLC. And so, you would do it at source, you would so, you would do it at source, you would so, you would do it at source, you would do it at build, you would do it at um, do it at build, you would do it at um, do it at build, you would do it at um, um, runtime, and then I'm sorry, you do um, runtime, and then I'm sorry, you do um, runtime, and then I'm sorry, you do it at deploy time, and then you would do it at deploy time, and then you would do it at deploy time, and then you would do it at runtime. And then what you would it at runtime. And then what you would it at runtime. And then what you would do is you would do a diff across all do is you would do a diff across all do is you would do a diff across all four of those. So that way you can see four of those. So that way you can see four of those. So that way you can see at what point in my SDLC did a at what point in my SDLC did a at what point in my SDLC did a particular package get introduced. You particular package get introduced. You particular package get introduced. You would then tag that um with a package would then tag that um with a package would then tag that um with a package label or Cyclone DX has support for label or Cyclone DX has support for label or Cyclone DX has support for tags. And then you would then ingest all tags. And then you would then ingest all tags. And then you would then ingest all of that into whatever your tooling is of that into whatever your tooling is of that into whatever your tooling is and be able to resurface that. Um are we and be able to resurface that. Um are we and be able to resurface that. Um are we there today? I don't think so. Um I there today? I don't think so. Um I there today? I don't think so. Um I think most people are kind of just think most people are kind of just think most people are kind of just choosing the one place that is going to choosing the one place that is going to choosing the one place that is going to be most accurately represent. Um but I be most accurately represent. Um but I be most accurately represent. Um but I actually think it's a huge gap. Um actually think it's a huge gap. Um actually think it's a huge gap. Um because the problem is you can know because the problem is you can know because the problem is you can know what's in your sbomb if you're only what's in your sbomb if you're only what's in your sbomb if you're only scanning it at build time which is what scanning it at build time which is what scanning it at build time which is what I'm recommending. What you may struggle I'm recommending. What you may struggle I'm recommending. What you may struggle with is figuring out well where was that with is figuring out well where was that with is figuring out well where was that introduced in particular most people introduced in particular most people introduced in particular most people have multi-stage builds now and so that have multi-stage builds now and so that have multi-stage builds now and so that becomes even more complicated on where becomes even more complicated on where becomes even more complicated on where is this particular dependency actually is this particular dependency actually is this particular dependency actually coming from and how do I then figure out coming from and how do I then figure out coming from and how do I then figure out which one of my hundred different repos which one of my hundred different repos which one of my hundred different repos do I need to go back to um to remediate do I need to go back to um to remediate do I need to go back to um to remediate that. So truthfully, I don't have the that. So truthfully, I don't have the that. So truthfully, I don't have the greatest answer for you right now at greatest answer for you right now at greatest answer for you right now at this moment, as much as it is that in my this moment, as much as it is that in my this moment, as much as it is that in my ideal world, I think we'd be required to ideal world, I think we'd be required to ideal world, I think we'd be required to scan at every stage. And if you have a scan at every stage. And if you have a scan at every stage. And if you have a mature enough organization where you're mature enough organization where you're mature enough organization where you're comfortable doing that, then I would comfortable doing that, then I would comfortable doing that, then I would actually recommend that you generate actually recommend that you generate actually recommend that you generate that ESPOM at source, you do it at build that ESPOM at source, you do it at build that ESPOM at source, you do it at build time, you then compare that um to the time, you then compare that um to the time, you then compare that um to the version of it at runtime, and then you version of it at runtime, and then you version of it at runtime, and then you kind of walk your way back into figuring kind of walk your way back into figuring kind of walk your way back into figuring out, okay, well, this dependency didn't out, okay, well, this dependency didn't out, okay, well, this dependency didn't exist at source, so it must have been exist at source, so it must have been exist at source, so it must have been introduced um during uh build time. So, introduced um during uh build time. So, introduced um during uh build time. So, but that's uh I want to chat more about but that's uh I want to chat more about but that's uh I want to chat more about that one because that's a hard problem that one because that's a hard problem that one because that's a hard problem to solve. So, Cortez, uh we're at time. to solve. So, Cortez, uh we're at time. to solve. So, Cortez, uh we're at time. So, uh we will direct audience members, So, uh we will direct audience members, So, uh we will direct audience members, find Cortez when you can. Yep. And uh find Cortez when you can. Yep.
