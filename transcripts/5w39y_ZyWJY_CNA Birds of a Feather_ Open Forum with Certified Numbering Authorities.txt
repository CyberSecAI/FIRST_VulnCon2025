So um but as you all probably can guess. So um but as you all probably can guess. So um but I just kind of wanted to give some I just kind of wanted to give some I just kind of wanted to give some background on this uh uh the talk and background on this uh uh the talk and background on this uh uh the talk and kind of where the idea came from. Here kind of where the idea came from. Here kind of where the idea came from. Here it is became a CNA in uh October of last it is became a CNA in uh October of last it is became a CNA in uh October of last year and joining the program was really year and joining the program was really year and joining the program was really cool. We learned a lot about it. I cool. We learned a lot about it. I cool. We learned a lot about it. I thought I knew how CV project works. I thought I knew how CV project works. I thought I knew how CV project works. I realized I have no idea. I'm still realized I have no idea. I'm still realized I have no idea. I'm still learning new stuff every day. Um, and learning new stuff every day. Um, and learning new stuff every day. Um, and you know, as I learn more and get more you know, as I learn more and get more you know, as I learn more and get more involved, uh, there's lots of ways for involved, uh, there's lots of ways for involved, uh, there's lots of ways for everybody to contribute, right? everybody to contribute, right? everybody to contribute, right? Everywhere from senior people who have, Everywhere from senior people who have, Everywhere from senior people who have, you know, the the loads of experience or you know, the the loads of experience or you know, the the loads of experience or brand new people, people in college brand new people, people in college brand new people, people in college looking for internships or like code to looking for internships or like code to looking for internships or like code to kind of prove themselves or do issues or kind of prove themselves or do issues or kind of prove themselves or do issues or anything else. So um we kind of anything else. So um we kind of anything else. So um we kind of approached it from the background of approached it from the background of approached it from the background of starting to give you know a basis starting to give you know a basis starting to give you know a basis through a couple slides and then um through a couple slides and then um through a couple slides and then um share kind of the stories along the way share kind of the stories along the way share kind of the stories along the way and talk about uh round out talking and talk about uh round out talking and talk about uh round out talking about life as a CNA. Um by show hands about life as a CNA. Um by show hands about life as a CNA. Um by show hands how many people here work like directly how many people here work like directly how many people here work like directly with a CNA? Like if your company's a CNA with a CNA? Like if your company's a CNA with a CNA? Like if your company's a CNA and you work in it? Yes. Okay. We're and you work in it? Yes. Okay. We're and you work in it? Yes. Okay. We're going to go through a lot of stuff going to go through a lot of stuff going to go through a lot of stuff probably a lot faster, but please feel probably a lot faster, but please feel probably a lot faster, but please feel free raise your hand if you have, you free raise your hand if you have, you free raise your hand if you have, you know, context or stories. Um, I haven't know, context or stories. Um, I haven't know, context or stories. Um, I haven't been around long enough, so if these been around long enough, so if these been around long enough, so if these guys lie, call them out for it cuz I guys lie, call them out for it cuz I guys lie, call them out for it cuz I can't do that. So, uh, yeah, with that can't do that. So, uh, yeah, with that can't do that. So, uh, yeah, with that kind of introductions out of the way. kind of introductions out of the way. kind of introductions out of the way. Um, I do have a couple fun questions to Um, I do have a couple fun questions to Um, I do have a couple fun questions to ask, ask, ask, uh, to throw them off game because I uh, to throw them off game because I uh, to throw them off game because I didn't tell everybody else. And Lisa, didn't tell everybody else. And Lisa, didn't tell everybody else. And Lisa, can we start with you? Oh, yeah. All can we start with you? Oh, yeah. All can we start with you? Oh, yeah. All right. So, and I kind of gave you the right. So, and I kind of gave you the right. So, and I kind of gave you the heads up on this one, but if you could heads up on this one, but if you could heads up on this one, but if you could assign a CVE to anything in life, right, assign a CVE to anything in life, right, assign a CVE to anything in life, right, we drop the we drop the technology we drop the we drop the technology we drop the we drop the technology constraint. It could be like doing the constraint. It could be like doing the constraint. It could be like doing the dishes. It could be, you know, the sound dishes. It could be, you know, the sound dishes. It could be, you know, the sound your alarm clock makes or whatever else, your alarm clock makes or whatever else, your alarm clock makes or whatever else, right? What would you put a CV out for? right? What would you put a CV out for? right? What would you put a CV out for? Traffic, not using your blinkers. Traffic, not using your blinkers. Traffic, not using your blinkers. Maybe my husband sometimes. That that's cold and also sets the tone. That that's cold and also sets the tone. That that's cold and also sets the tone. Lisa has kept me on my toes through Lisa has kept me on my toes through Lisa has kept me on my toes through this. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It improves over this. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It improves over this. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It improves over time. It gets much more stable. time. It gets much more stable. time. It gets much more stable. Um Yeah. Cool. So yeah, part of the Um Yeah. Cool. So yeah, part of the Um Yeah. Cool. So yeah, part of the reason part of the way we put this reason part of the way we put this reason part of the way we put this together is we did prepare some slides together is we did prepare some slides together is we did prepare some slides and we had just kind of like two or and we had just kind of like two or and we had just kind of like two or three calls where we talked about the three calls where we talked about the three calls where we talked about the history of things and whatnot. So we're history of things and whatnot. So we're history of things and whatnot. So we're going to kind of move through those. going to kind of move through those. going to kind of move through those. Everybody as you have comments feel free Everybody as you have comments feel free Everybody as you have comments feel free to bring them out. Right. And Scott, I to bring them out. Right. And Scott, I to bring them out. Right. And Scott, I think you wanted to start on the think you wanted to start on the think you wanted to start on the beginning. And we're on the beginning. beginning. And we're on the beginning. beginning. And we're on the beginning. Uh oh, here's an overview of what we're Uh oh, here's an overview of what we're Uh oh, here's an overview of what we're going to talk through. Sorry, a little going to talk through. Sorry, a little going to talk through. Sorry, a little bit of the sequencing. So, we're going bit of the sequencing. So, we're going bit of the sequencing. So, we're going to go through kind of an overview of the to go through kind of an overview of the to go through kind of an overview of the CV program since you're pretty much all CV program since you're pretty much all CV program since you're pretty much all CNAs. We'll be really quick there. Uh CNAs. We'll be really quick there. Uh CNAs. We'll be really quick there. Uh talk a little bit about the structure of talk a little bit about the structure of talk a little bit about the structure of it. Again, we'll go quick and then we'll it. Again, we'll go quick and then we'll it. Again, we'll go quick and then we'll just really kind of dig into the history just really kind of dig into the history just really kind of dig into the history and timeline. And again, I found a lot and timeline. And again, I found a lot and timeline. And again, I found a lot of things that I didn't know. Um, of things that I didn't know. Um, of things that I didn't know. Um, everybody that I've talked here to has everybody that I've talked here to has everybody that I've talked here to has has about it has said it would be nice has about it has said it would be nice has about it has said it would be nice to know where this came from or I didn't to know where this came from or I didn't to know where this came from or I didn't know it originated from this or you know know it originated from this or you know know it originated from this or you know I had no idea that uh CVE and NIST are I had no idea that uh CVE and NIST are I had no idea that uh CVE and NIST are not the same thing an organization. not the same thing an organization. not the same thing an organization. So all So all So all right with that you want to give us some right with that you want to give us some right with that you want to give us some background on where it came from? I I background on where it came from? I I background on where it came from? I I promise it won't be old man yells at promise it won't be old man yells at promise it won't be old man yells at cloud. Um, so, cloud. Um, so, cloud. Um, so, uh, biography wise, uh, in 1983, my dad uh, biography wise, uh, in 1983, my dad uh, biography wise, uh, in 1983, my dad brought home a computer. The same year brought home a computer. The same year brought home a computer. The same year that I saw War Games, uh, which, you that I saw War Games, uh, which, you that I saw War Games, uh, which, you know, basically got me extremely know, basically got me extremely know, basically got me extremely interested in the security end of interested in the security end of interested in the security end of uh, how computers worked and and uh, how computers worked and and uh, how computers worked and and and and how everything was uh, talking and and how everything was uh, talking and and how everything was uh, talking to each other with code and, you know, to each other with code and, you know, to each other with code and, you know, get computer games and control break out get computer games and control break out get computer games and control break out of them to see what the code's doing. of them to see what the code's doing. of them to see what the code's doing. Um, so I started college in Um, so I started college in Um, so I started college in 1992 and I had the idea of I I wanted to 1992 and I had the idea of I I wanted to 1992 and I had the idea of I I wanted to be a computer hacker. Um, and I found be a computer hacker. Um, and I found be a computer hacker. Um, and I found out very quickly that as soon as I out very quickly that as soon as I out very quickly that as soon as I started, nothing was encrypted. So I was started, nothing was encrypted. So I was started, nothing was encrypted. So I was a very good computer hacker when a very good computer hacker when a very good computer hacker when everybody at the University of everybody at the University of everybody at the University of Tennessee's password was faculty. Tennessee's password was faculty. Tennessee's password was faculty. uh as as as soon as uh encryption got uh as as as soon as uh encryption got uh as as as soon as uh encryption got more popular more popular more popular um I was not as good a hacker anymore. um I was not as good a hacker anymore. um I was not as good a hacker anymore. So um through IRC and news groups I So um through IRC and news groups I So um through IRC and news groups I started collecting exploits of uh not started collecting exploits of uh not started collecting exploits of uh not that I understood how how to use them that I understood how how to use them that I understood how how to use them but I understood how to collect them and but I understood how to collect them and but I understood how to collect them and how to collect data and I collected them how to collect data and I collected them how to collect data and I collected them like baseball cards. So, I did that like baseball cards. So, I did that like baseball cards. So, I did that through starting in around through starting in around through starting in around 1994. Um, and I did that for several 1994. Um, and I did that for several 1994. Um, and I did that for several years. This was before search engines, years. This was before search engines, years. This was before search engines, so you couldn't necessarily search. But so you couldn't necessarily search. But so you couldn't necessarily search. But Yahoo had a direct directory listing Yahoo had a direct directory listing Yahoo had a direct directory listing that was curated, so you had to submit that was curated, so you had to submit that was curated, so you had to submit links to it. And my quote unquote links to it. And my quote unquote links to it. And my quote unquote database, it was just a flat file, but database, it was just a flat file, but database, it was just a flat file, but was added to the Yahoo list, so it got a was added to the Yahoo list, so it got a was added to the Yahoo list, so it got a little popular. little popular. little popular. Not much. It wasn't like Phyors or or Not much. It wasn't like Phyors or or Not much. It wasn't like Phyors or or any or root shell or any of those, but any or root shell or any of those, but any or root shell or any of those, but uh internet security uh internet security uh internet security systems called to start a database in systems called to start a database in systems called to start a database in 1997. So I had to forgo my senior year 1997. So I had to forgo my senior year 1997. So I had to forgo my senior year of college and turn of college and turn of college and turn professional. Um started a database in professional. Um started a database in professional. Um started a database in and CV became a thing in 1999. and CV became a thing in 1999. and CV became a thing in 1999. So uh in doing this I had a conversation So uh in doing this I had a conversation So uh in doing this I had a conversation with a colleague who wrote a a really with a colleague who wrote a a really with a colleague who wrote a a really great paper that I wish he was talking great paper that I wish he was talking great paper that I wish he was talking here this week that equated everything here this week that equated everything here this week that equated everything to three main events uh CBE to three to three main events uh CBE to three to three main events uh CBE to three main events which was the cuckoo's egg main events which was the cuckoo's egg main events which was the cuckoo's egg which if you haven't read it read it um which if you haven't read it read it um which if you haven't read it read it um you know about uh the astronomer at you know about uh the astronomer at you know about uh the astronomer at Berkeley who discovered KGB spy who had Berkeley who discovered KGB spy who had Berkeley who discovered KGB spy who had gone through several networks to get uh gone through several networks to get uh gone through several networks to get uh information to relay back to the to the information to relay back to the to the information to relay back to the to the Russians. Um just so happens one of the Russians. Um just so happens one of the Russians. Um just so happens one of the machines he went through was machines he went through was machines he went through was MITER. Um, shortly after that it was the MITER. Um, shortly after that it was the MITER. Um, shortly after that it was the Robert Morris worm who used finger and Robert Morris worm who used finger and Robert Morris worm who used finger and uh I don't remember if it was send 2 but uh I don't remember if it was send 2 but uh I don't remember if it was send 2 but several of several of several of the you know buffer overflows in those the you know buffer overflows in those the you know buffer overflows in those programs to to uh go through the to programs to to uh go through the to programs to to uh go through the to measure the size of the internet right measure the size of the internet right measure the size of the internet right um and then um and then um and then RPC netstatd buffer overflow which was RPC netstatd buffer overflow which was RPC netstatd buffer overflow which was 98 I believe and at that point MITER 98 I believe and at that point MITER 98 I believe and at that point MITER went to their went to their went to their um their I guess uh security scanning um their I guess uh security scanning um their I guess uh security scanning guy David man who and they he said they guy David man who and they he said they guy David man who and they he said they said put a list of these all these logs said put a list of these all these logs said put a list of these all these logs together together together um and try to um and try to um and try to find make a system find make a system find make a system to correlate all these vulnerabilities to correlate all these vulnerabilities to correlate all these vulnerabilities to one thing right so David man Steve to one thing right so David man Steve to one thing right so David man Steve Christie can I can I just cut in here Christie can I can I just cut in here Christie can I can I just cut in here there's no centralized way to talk about there's no centralized way to talk about there's no centralized way to talk about these, right? Like there's the attack these, right? Like there's the attack these, right? Like there's the attack itself is there was there was four main itself is there was there was four main itself is there was there was four main databases they used. Um they all talked databases they used. Um they all talked databases they used. Um they all talked about vulnerabilities but they didn't about vulnerabilities but they didn't about vulnerabilities but they didn't match up with each other. There was no match up with each other. There was no match up with each other. There was no identifier for one thing. Did did they identifier for one thing. Did did they identifier for one thing. Did did they have four IDs at least or was it just have four IDs at least or was it just have four IDs at least or was it just kind of like uh I mean there was ID and kind of like uh I mean there was ID and kind of like uh I mean there was ID and aert number and a Satan and netstat or aert number and a Satan and netstat or aert number and a Satan and netstat or whatever. Cool. Right. whatever. Cool. Right. whatever. Cool. Right. Um, so they wrote a paper enumerating Um, so they wrote a paper enumerating Um, so they wrote a paper enumerating common common common vulnerabil enumerating what was it? vulnerabil enumerating what was it? vulnerabil enumerating what was it? Enumerating common vulnerabilities. Enumerating common vulnerabilities. Enumerating common vulnerabilities. Yeah, common vulnerability enumeration. Yeah, common vulnerability enumeration. Yeah, common vulnerability enumeration. Common vulnerability enumerations. Common vulnerability enumerations. Common vulnerability enumerations. Sorry. Somehow 30 years later, I've Sorry. Somehow 30 years later, I've Sorry. Somehow 30 years later, I've assigned two and a half% of all the assigned two and a half% of all the assigned two and a half% of all the CVEs. CVEs. CVEs. Nice. Yeah, if you didn't hear that, two Nice. Yeah, if you didn't hear that, two Nice. Yeah, if you didn't hear that, two and a half% of all CVEes go to Scott. and a half% of all CVEes go to Scott. and a half% of all CVEes go to Scott. So, he was the first person I talked to So, he was the first person I talked to So, he was the first person I talked to and it turns out he knew everybody else and it turns out he knew everybody else and it turns out he knew everybody else here. So, so yeah. So, you kind of grew here. So, so yeah. So, you kind of grew here. So, so yeah. So, you kind of grew up in the program, right? Like you said, up in the program, right? Like you said, up in the program, right? Like you said, you left senior year of college to do it you left senior year of college to do it you left senior year of college to do it and and this is exclusively like what and and this is exclusively like what and and this is exclusively like what you've done is is vulnerability. I ran a you've done is is vulnerability. I ran a you've done is is vulnerability. I ran a a vulnerability database for 30 years. a vulnerability database for 30 years. a vulnerability database for 30 years. Yeah. Up until last year when I moved Yeah. Up until last year when I moved Yeah. Up until last year when I moved over to the product security side. over to the product security side. over to the product security side. Gotcha. So nice. Is it different at all? Gotcha. So nice. Is it different at all? Gotcha. So nice. Is it different at all? I don't have to do a time sheet anymore. I don't have to do a time sheet anymore. I don't have to do a time sheet anymore. All right. That's that's the most All right. That's that's the most All right. That's that's the most important perk. That's what every important perk. That's what every important perk. That's what every product loves. product loves. product loves. Cool. So, yeah. So, you know, I think Cool. So, yeah. So, you know, I think Cool. So, yeah. So, you know, I think you hit a lot of the the milestones on you hit a lot of the the milestones on you hit a lot of the the milestones on there, but um yeah, CV CVE came out, there, but um yeah, CV CVE came out, there, but um yeah, CV CVE came out, right? The origination came out of right? The origination came out of right? The origination came out of MITER, right? MITER is a lot bigger than MITER, right? MITER is a lot bigger than MITER, right? MITER is a lot bigger than just CVE, but I didn't know that. I just CVE, but I didn't know that. I just CVE, but I didn't know that. I thought it was just a technical thought it was just a technical thought it was just a technical organization from the government. Turns organization from the government. Turns organization from the government. Turns out they do all sorts of research and out they do all sorts of research and out they do all sorts of research and stuff. Um and yeah, there was a where stuff. Um and yeah, there was a where stuff. Um and yeah, there was a where was the talk at? Was it Duke where they was the talk at? Was it Duke where they was the talk at? Was it Duke where they put the Purdue Purdue University? And put the Purdue Purdue University? And put the Purdue Purdue University? And then everything kind of sprang from then everything kind of sprang from then everything kind of sprang from there, right? Like there, right? Like there, right? Like if if MITER hadn't gone to Dave and been if if MITER hadn't gone to Dave and been if if MITER hadn't gone to Dave and been willing to invest, we'd all be issuing willing to invest, we'd all be issuing willing to invest, we'd all be issuing serious IDs instead of CBS. I I'm serious IDs instead of CBS. I I'm serious IDs instead of CBS. I I'm thankful Jean's purchasing at Purdue, thankful Jean's purchasing at Purdue, thankful Jean's purchasing at Purdue, right? Yeah. Cool. Yeah. I I'm a big fan right? Yeah. Cool. Yeah. I I'm a big fan right? Yeah. Cool. Yeah. I I'm a big fan of the CV program and and specifically of the CV program and and specifically of the CV program and and specifically the mission statement, right? like the the mission statement, right? like the the mission statement, right? like the the one thing that CVS are for is for the one thing that CVS are for is for the one thing that CVS are for is for identifying, defining and catalog identifying, defining and catalog identifying, defining and catalog publicly disclosures, you know, uh cyber publicly disclosures, you know, uh cyber publicly disclosures, you know, uh cyber and cyber security vulnerabilities. Um and cyber security vulnerabilities. Um and cyber security vulnerabilities. Um this sounds really simple and in the six this sounds really simple and in the six this sounds really simple and in the six months that I've been part of the months that I've been part of the months that I've been part of the discussions like I kind of assumed discussions like I kind of assumed discussions like I kind of assumed everybody got it and even I got it and everybody got it and even I got it and everybody got it and even I got it and it's amazing how many times that wedge it's amazing how many times that wedge it's amazing how many times that wedge tries to get opened up to be other tries to get opened up to be other tries to get opened up to be other things, right? Whether it's you know EOL things, right? Whether it's you know EOL things, right? Whether it's you know EOL announcements, right? was a big thing announcements, right? was a big thing announcements, right? was a big thing recently or you know product recently or you know product recently or you know product advertisement and people spamming stuff advertisement and people spamming stuff advertisement and people spamming stuff or everything else. or everything else. or everything else. So, all So, all So, all right. So, everybody here feel right. So, everybody here feel right. So, everybody here feel comfortable with what a CNA is? I'm not comfortable with what a CNA is? I'm not comfortable with what a CNA is? I'm not watching the Discord chat, but I'll watching the Discord chat, but I'll watching the Discord chat, but I'll leave this up for a second and the the leave this up for a second and the the leave this up for a second and the the slides are in there. CNAs are basically slides are in there. CNAs are basically slides are in there. CNAs are basically part of this structure that is on the part of this structure that is on the part of this structure that is on the MITER website and I stole or the CVE MITER website and I stole or the CVE MITER website and I stole or the CVE project. um basically a way to project. um basically a way to project. um basically a way to categorize who can file vulnerabilities categorize who can file vulnerabilities categorize who can file vulnerabilities in this program because can't let in this program because can't let in this program because can't let everybody do it. Um and and scale is a everybody do it. Um and and scale is a everybody do it. Um and and scale is a problem, right? As we talk about the problem, right? As we talk about the problem, right? As we talk about the timeline, we'll talk about where scale timeline, we'll talk about where scale timeline, we'll talk about where scale was a problem too cuz I didn't realize was a problem too cuz I didn't realize was a problem too cuz I didn't realize some of this. Um but yeah, so you kind some of this. Um but yeah, so you kind some of this. Um but yeah, so you kind of have your structure of top level of have your structure of top level of have your structure of top level roots, right? There's only a few of roots, right? There's only a few of roots, right? There's only a few of those for kind of the domains they those for kind of the domains they those for kind of the domains they control roots underneath uh right like control roots underneath uh right like control roots underneath uh right like all the minor more open source stuff and all the minor more open source stuff and all the minor more open source stuff and then the actual CNAs in multitude. Um then the actual CNAs in multitude. Um then the actual CNAs in multitude. Um we'll talk about the stats of how that we'll talk about the stats of how that we'll talk about the stats of how that how those numbers have grown in just a how those numbers have grown in just a how those numbers have grown in just a little bit. All right. So yeah, so we little bit. All right. So yeah, so we little bit. All right. So yeah, so we kind of broke things out into eras. kind of broke things out into eras. kind of broke things out into eras. There seem to be like natural break There seem to be like natural break There seem to be like natural break points where evolutions in the CVE points where evolutions in the CVE points where evolutions in the CVE program came from. Um Scott already hit program came from. Um Scott already hit program came from. Um Scott already hit on some of kind of the uh early stuff, on some of kind of the uh early stuff, on some of kind of the uh early stuff, right? Founded in in 99. Um but the right? Founded in in 99. Um but the right? Founded in in 99. Um but the first kind of one that's interesting first kind of one that's interesting first kind of one that's interesting where uh it seems like the organization, where uh it seems like the organization, where uh it seems like the organization, you know, starts to morph or take a you know, starts to morph or take a you know, starts to morph or take a different shape is 2005. Um from 99 to different shape is 2005. Um from 99 to different shape is 2005. Um from 99 to 2005, 2005, 2005, uh the CVE project was fairly small, uh the CVE project was fairly small, uh the CVE project was fairly small, right? It had a group of people that right? It had a group of people that right? It had a group of people that were dedicated to it, but the board were dedicated to it, but the board were dedicated to it, but the board itself was responsible for testing every itself was responsible for testing every itself was responsible for testing every CVE, right? which means installing it on CVE, right? which means installing it on CVE, right? which means installing it on hardware when we don't have VMs and all hardware when we don't have VMs and all hardware when we don't have VMs and all those kind of things. So, lots of those kind of things. So, lots of those kind of things. So, lots of esoteric things they had to cover ground esoteric things they had to cover ground esoteric things they had to cover ground for validating it and then issuing the for validating it and then issuing the for validating it and then issuing the CVE directly. Um, and I believe this was CVE directly. Um, and I believe this was CVE directly. Um, and I believe this was all mostly like a all mostly like a all mostly like a manual process for it. Right. I was a manual process for it. Right. I was a manual process for it. Right. I was a punk kid punk kid punk kid who I didn't care. I had a manager that who I didn't care. I had a manager that who I didn't care. I had a manager that did luckily and he's he you know Andre did luckily and he's he you know Andre did luckily and he's he you know Andre Fresh started was one of the original Fresh started was one of the original Fresh started was one of the original editorial board guys who voted voted on editorial board guys who voted voted on editorial board guys who voted voted on each vulnerability to see if it got a each vulnerability to see if it got a each vulnerability to see if it got a CVE or not. Uh they they started out as CVE or not. Uh they they started out as CVE or not. Uh they they started out as cans candidates cans candidates cans candidates the board had to test them and vote and the board had to test them and vote and the board had to test them and vote and then they became CBE right and how big then they became CBE right and how big then they became CBE right and how big was the the board at the time was like was the the board at the time was like was the the board at the time was like eight or 10 people I don't know okay so eight or 10 people I don't know okay so eight or 10 people I don't know okay so eight or 10. All right. So low low eight or 10. All right. So low low eight or 10. All right. So low low numbers in the beginning though not numbers in the beginning though not numbers in the beginning though not terribly adopted but you know pretty terribly adopted but you know pretty terribly adopted but you know pretty quickly and first couple years it grows quickly and first couple years it grows quickly and first couple years it grows and kind of um the scale of it gets too and kind of um the scale of it gets too and kind of um the scale of it gets too big right so 2005 era MITER gets more big right so 2005 era MITER gets more big right so 2005 era MITER gets more involved the board transitions the uh involved the board transitions the uh involved the board transitions the uh was always involved always involved but was always involved always involved but was always involved always involved but kind of more they always ran it and so kind of more they always ran it and so kind of more they always ran it and so it wasn't until 2005 that the first CNA it wasn't until 2005 that the first CNA it wasn't until 2005 that the first CNA started. Oh, okay. Okay. See, still started. Oh, okay. Okay. See, still started. Oh, okay. Okay. See, still learning. So, yeah. 2005 first CNA learning. So, yeah. 2005 first CNA learning. So, yeah. 2005 first CNA started. They start to delegate out. The started. They start to delegate out. The started. They start to delegate out. The board is not necessarily responsible for board is not necessarily responsible for board is not necessarily responsible for testing everything themselves. They gave testing everything themselves. They gave testing everything themselves. They gave up the whole can thing. up the whole can thing. up the whole can thing. Was that Yeah. Was that a battle getting Was that Yeah. Was that a battle getting Was that Yeah. Was that a battle getting there on it or It was 2004. They stopped there on it or It was 2004. They stopped there on it or It was 2004. They stopped voting. They just let them in. Gotcha. voting. They just let them in. Gotcha. voting. They just let them in. Gotcha. So, yeah. First CNAs kind of evolved So, yeah. First CNAs kind of evolved So, yeah. First CNAs kind of evolved then. Um, but there's not a lot not a then. Um, but there's not a lot not a then. Um, but there's not a lot not a lot of lift there and the program is lot of lift there and the program is lot of lift there and the program is still getting out there. wasn't kind of still getting out there. wasn't kind of still getting out there. wasn't kind of until uh 2010 and even 2016, which we'll until uh 2010 and even 2016, which we'll until uh 2010 and even 2016, which we'll talk about, where um CV really starts to talk about, where um CV really starts to talk about, where um CV really starts to become more of a household name. It become more of a household name. It become more of a household name. It starts to hit open source. Um 2010 is starts to hit open source. Um 2010 is starts to hit open source. Um 2010 is kind of a watershed moment where there's kind of a watershed moment where there's kind of a watershed moment where there's more reserved CVE than there are more reserved CVE than there are more reserved CVE than there are published, meaning, you know, the the published, meaning, you know, the the published, meaning, you know, the the life cycle of it, right? You reserve a life cycle of it, right? You reserve a life cycle of it, right? You reserve a name, nobody knows what you're going to name, nobody knows what you're going to name, nobody knows what you're going to put on it because you want to do, you put on it because you want to do, you put on it because you want to do, you know, uh coordinated vulnerability know, uh coordinated vulnerability know, uh coordinated vulnerability disclosure, not weaponize it for people. disclosure, not weaponize it for people. disclosure, not weaponize it for people. Um so yeah, so more than doubled. Let's Um so yeah, so more than doubled. Let's Um so yeah, so more than doubled. Let's be clear on that. There were more CVs be clear on that. There were more CVs be clear on that. There were more CVs reserved in advanced than p than reserved in advanced than p than reserved in advanced than p than assigned after the vulnerability was assigned after the vulnerability was assigned after the vulnerability was caught. Okay, that's a that's a good caught. Okay, that's a that's a good caught. Okay, that's a that's a good distinction on it. So rather than zero distinction on it. So rather than zero distinction on it. So rather than zero daying everybody, right, there was more daying everybody, right, there was more daying everybody, right, there was more reserved reserved CVS than after the reserved reserved CVS than after the reserved reserved CVS than after the fact. Well, they they weren't fact. Well, they they weren't fact. Well, they they weren't necessarily still reserved. They they necessarily still reserved. They they necessarily still reserved. They they reserved in advance and then published. reserved in advance and then published. reserved in advance and then published. Gotcha. Right. Gotcha. Yeah. And that Gotcha. Right. Gotcha. Yeah. And that Gotcha. Right. Gotcha. Yeah. And that kind of that kind of comes up uh kind of that kind of comes up uh kind of that kind of comes up uh throughout this in in some of the throughout this in in some of the throughout this in in some of the conversations too, right? Uh it wasn't conversations too, right? Uh it wasn't conversations too, right? Uh it wasn't uncommon until a certain point that CVE uncommon until a certain point that CVE uncommon until a certain point that CVE would get reserved but nobody would would get reserved but nobody would would get reserved but nobody would follow then they would publish it, follow then they would publish it, follow then they would publish it, right? They publish it through, you right? They publish it through, you right? They publish it through, you know, Microsoft or the leaderboards or know, Microsoft or the leaderboards or know, Microsoft or the leaderboards or the message boards or whatever, but the the message boards or whatever, but the the message boards or whatever, but the uh the CVE itself never got updated, uh the CVE itself never got updated, uh the CVE itself never got updated, right? So you had a lot of floating CVE right? So you had a lot of floating CVE right? So you had a lot of floating CVE ids with no context of what they were, ids with no context of what they were, ids with no context of what they were, right? So when MITER was doing most of right? So when MITER was doing most of right? So when MITER was doing most of the assignments, MITER would uh reserve the assignments, MITER would uh reserve the assignments, MITER would uh reserve a CV ID for a vulnerability, but uh then a CV ID for a vulnerability, but uh then a CV ID for a vulnerability, but uh then a researcher might publish it and never a researcher might publish it and never a researcher might publish it and never tell MITER about it. Publish it Yeah. tell MITER about it. Publish it Yeah. tell MITER about it. Publish it Yeah. outside of the CV project, right? Like outside of the CV project, right? Like outside of the CV project, right? Like publish it on the website or to publish it on the website or to publish it on the website or to customers or whatever, right? Yeah. And customers or whatever, right? Yeah. And customers or whatever, right? Yeah. And so MITER, you know, would scrape so MITER, you know, would scrape so MITER, you know, would scrape different sources to find uh you know, different sources to find uh you know, different sources to find uh you know, that information, but you know, didn't that information, but you know, didn't that information, but you know, didn't catch everything. catch everything. catch everything. Interesting. So you couldn't So it was Interesting. So you couldn't So it was Interesting. So you couldn't So it was still rudimentary enough that you still rudimentary enough that you still rudimentary enough that you couldn't go back and talk to the CNAs couldn't go back and talk to the CNAs couldn't go back and talk to the CNAs and say like hey you have to give it to and say like hey you have to give it to and say like hey you have to give it to us after the fact. There weren't enough us after the fact. There weren't enough us after the fact. There weren't enough CNAs. MITER was doing probably 90% of CNAs. MITER was doing probably 90% of CNAs. MITER was doing probably 90% of the assign Well oh gotcha probably more the assign Well oh gotcha probably more the assign Well oh gotcha probably more like 70% of the assignments but um and like 70% of the assignments but um and like 70% of the assignments but um and it was all still like email at this it was all still like email at this it was all still like email at this point right? Yeah. And the other thing point right? Yeah. And the other thing point right? Yeah. And the other thing is like MITER hadn't built up that part is like MITER hadn't built up that part is like MITER hadn't built up that part of the communication process. Like um of the communication process. Like um of the communication process. Like um Microsoft never came and told us that Microsoft never came and told us that Microsoft never came and told us that the CVS uh were published. We just the CVS uh were published. We just the CVS uh were published. We just monitored Microsoft and publish them monitored Microsoft and publish them monitored Microsoft and publish them because MITER was still writing the because MITER was still writing the because MITER was still writing the descriptions up until 2016. You just got descriptions up until 2016. You just got descriptions up until 2016. You just got to watch for patch Tuesday, right? to watch for patch Tuesday, right? to watch for patch Tuesday, right? Exactly. Lisa Lisa runs patch Tuesday. Exactly. Lisa Lisa runs patch Tuesday. Exactly. Lisa Lisa runs patch Tuesday. So it's amazing that she's here today at So it's amazing that she's here today at So it's amazing that she's here today at all. Yeah. One of the other things uh all. Yeah. One of the other things uh all. Yeah. One of the other things uh that was a requirement for being a CNA that was a requirement for being a CNA that was a requirement for being a CNA at the time was that we would be able to at the time was that we would be able to at the time was that we would be able to scrape your website. Oh, rather than scrape your website. Oh, rather than scrape your website. Oh, rather than getting it up front, we'll we'll get it getting it up front, we'll we'll get it getting it up front, we'll we'll get it after the fact. You just have to put it after the fact. You just have to put it after the fact. You just have to put it somewhere. Right. We we have to be able somewhere. Right. We we have to be able somewhere. Right. We we have to be able to monitor it so that we know when to monitor it so that we know when to monitor it so that we know when you've published and when we need to you've published and when we need to you've published and when we need to publish. Um and and to get a number, publish. Um and and to get a number, publish. Um and and to get a number, right? Wasn't there was like someone's right? Wasn't there was like someone's right? Wasn't there was like someone's personal email at MITER.org or CVU personal email at MITER.org or CVU personal email at MITER.org or CVU project that you just email and say, project that you just email and say, project that you just email and say, "Hey, I need five CVU numbers." And that "Hey, I need five CVU numbers." And that "Hey, I need five CVU numbers." And that was it. Right. up until like 2011, I was it. Right. up until like 2011, I was it. Right. up until like 2011, I think. Uh we were using uh Steve think. Uh we were using uh Steve think. Uh we were using uh Steve Christiey's personal uh MITER email. Christiey's personal uh MITER email. Christiey's personal uh MITER email. Yes. So still a miter.org, but Steve Yes. So still a miter.org, but Steve Yes. So still a miter.org, but Steve probably doesn't use his email very much probably doesn't use his email very much probably doesn't use his email very much still to this day, I would imagine. still to this day, I would imagine. still to this day, I would imagine. Right. If that was the the single Right. If that was the the single Right. If that was the the single repository for him. So cool. So yeah, repository for him. So cool. So yeah, repository for him. So cool. So yeah, again, pretty pretty, you know, low tech again, pretty pretty, you know, low tech again, pretty pretty, you know, low tech uh you know, community taking care of uh you know, community taking care of uh you know, community taking care of itself solutions, right? Yeah. The other itself solutions, right? Yeah. The other itself solutions, right? Yeah. The other thing during that time is that a lot of thing during that time is that a lot of thing during that time is that a lot of the CVids might assigned we found the CVids might assigned we found the CVids might assigned we found through searching the the web ourselves. through searching the the web ourselves. through searching the the web ourselves. It wasn't somebody coming and asking us It wasn't somebody coming and asking us It wasn't somebody coming and asking us to assign. Oh, really? Sorry. Oh, to assign. Oh, really? Sorry. Oh, to assign. Oh, really? Sorry. Oh, really? Is the the expression there. really? Is the the expression there. really? Is the the expression there. Yeah. That that's why the other half Yeah. That that's why the other half Yeah. That that's why the other half before in 2010 was signed after the before in 2010 was signed after the before in 2010 was signed after the vulnerability was public is because vulnerability was public is because vulnerability was public is because going and finding it. Gotcha. Gotcha. going and finding it. Gotcha. Gotcha. going and finding it. Gotcha. Gotcha. kind of coincides with when search kind of coincides with when search kind of coincides with when search engines really did become available too engines really did become available too engines really did become available too and made it more possible to do that I and made it more possible to do that I and made it more possible to do that I bet bet bet but cool so that brings us then but but but cool so that brings us then but but but cool so that brings us then but but so still it's kind of a reactive so still it's kind of a reactive so still it's kind of a reactive solution andor best efforts basis it's solution andor best efforts basis it's solution andor best efforts basis it's not the centralized you know kind of not the centralized you know kind of not the centralized you know kind of source that it is right at least for for source that it is right at least for for source that it is right at least for for a lot of the the technical community out a lot of the the technical community out a lot of the the technical community out there for identifying vulnerabilities there for identifying vulnerabilities there for identifying vulnerabilities right like you said like you you would right like you said like you you would right like you said like you you would go out and find it and create a number go out and find it and create a number go out and find it and create a number for it and put the details in and for it and put the details in and for it and put the details in and publish it because somebody didn't think publish it because somebody didn't think publish it because somebody didn't think to come to the project and do it. When to come to the project and do it. When to come to the project and do it. When did that switch? Like when would you say did that switch? Like when would you say did that switch? Like when would you say kind of the era? I I mean it it was a kind of the era? I I mean it it was a kind of the era? I I mean it it was a progressive thing. Like I said in 2010, progressive thing. Like I said in 2010, progressive thing. Like I said in 2010, right? Half of them were uh reserved in right? Half of them were uh reserved in right? Half of them were uh reserved in advance. advance. advance. Um you know, I I don't know the exact Um you know, I I don't know the exact Um you know, I I don't know the exact numbers on how much it's you know, we'll numbers on how much it's you know, we'll numbers on how much it's you know, we'll have a chart actually in a minute. We'll have a chart actually in a minute. We'll have a chart actually in a minute. We'll probably be able to see it in some of probably be able to see it in some of probably be able to see it in some of the I know I believe in 2016 MITER also the I know I believe in 2016 MITER also the I know I believe in 2016 MITER also stopped proactively signing. Okay. Yeah. stopped proactively signing. Okay. Yeah. stopped proactively signing. Okay. Yeah. So 2016. Okay. So let's get into that So 2016. Okay. So let's get into that So 2016. Okay. So let's get into that because that's where a lot of the more because that's where a lot of the more because that's where a lot of the more modern stuff comes from and and CV as I modern stuff comes from and and CV as I modern stuff comes from and and CV as I recognize it, right? Starts there. So um recognize it, right? Starts there. So um recognize it, right? Starts there. So um yeah, we'll talk about the the expansion yeah, we'll talk about the the expansion yeah, we'll talk about the the expansion of it like uh by by 2016 I think there of it like uh by by 2016 I think there of it like uh by by 2016 I think there was 45 different CNAs at that point, was 45 different CNAs at that point, was 45 different CNAs at that point, right? So grew pretty rapidly from right? So grew pretty rapidly from right? So grew pretty rapidly from there. there. there. Um the second route came aboard which is Um the second route came aboard which is Um the second route came aboard which is CISA right the the the government agency CISA right the the the government agency CISA right the the the government agency and yeah CNAs themselves started to file and yeah CNAs themselves started to file and yeah CNAs themselves started to file the CVEEs under the respective scopes the CVEEs under the respective scopes the CVEEs under the respective scopes right right right so MITER and the CV project kind of take so MITER and the CV project kind of take so MITER and the CV project kind of take a step back filter it as it comes a step back filter it as it comes a step back filter it as it comes through is that when the self-service through is that when the self-service through is that when the self-service tools and vulnerogram and those kind of tools and vulnerogram and those kind of tools and vulnerogram and those kind of things started to come about yep all things started to come about yep all things started to come about yep all that started getting planned and that started getting planned and that started getting planned and developed at that time you guys didn't developed at that time you guys didn't developed at that time you guys didn't want to do it manually still with with want to do it manually still with with want to do it manually still with with emails the whole emails the whole emails the whole Cool. Yeah. Anything anything else about Cool. Yeah. Anything anything else about Cool. Yeah. Anything anything else about the era? I feel like there was some good the era? I feel like there was some good the era? I feel like there was some good comments in there. Wasn't there I I comments in there. Wasn't there I I comments in there. Wasn't there I I believe there was a little bit of not believe there was a little bit of not believe there was a little bit of not necessarily turmoil, but there there had necessarily turmoil, but there there had necessarily turmoil, but there there had been a lack of enthusiasm and been a lack of enthusiasm and been a lack of enthusiasm and involvement from the community. involvement from the community. involvement from the community. I'd say since MITER was doing I'd say since MITER was doing I'd say since MITER was doing everything, everybody was frustrated everything, everybody was frustrated everything, everybody was frustrated with MITER because they couldn't with MITER because they couldn't with MITER because they couldn't possibly do it fast enough. And so there possibly do it fast enough. And so there possibly do it fast enough. And so there was a lot of was a lot of was a lot of discontent around the CBE program and so discontent around the CBE program and so discontent around the CBE program and so it had to change. And so in 2016 the it had to change. And so in 2016 the it had to change. And so in 2016 the board really decided to federate and and board really decided to federate and and board really decided to federate and and give more power to the CNAs. And over give more power to the CNAs. And over give more power to the CNAs. And over time they've made it easier for the CNAs time they've made it easier for the CNAs time they've made it easier for the CNAs to really do the work themselves. to really do the work themselves. to really do the work themselves. Yeah. It's very much like a customer Yeah. It's very much like a customer Yeah. It's very much like a customer success or customer support team, right? success or customer support team, right? success or customer support team, right? nobody shows up necessarily happy there nobody shows up necessarily happy there nobody shows up necessarily happy there to do it and file the thing and any sort to do it and file the thing and any sort to do it and file the thing and any sort of bottleneck is going to be the of bottleneck is going to be the of bottleneck is going to be the problem, right? problem, right? problem, right? Um, yeah. So, and I think that's also Um, yeah. So, and I think that's also Um, yeah. So, and I think that's also when was CVD also kind of espouseed then when was CVD also kind of espouseed then when was CVD also kind of espouseed then and really became a thing or was it and really became a thing or was it and really became a thing or was it technically was it in the spec kind of technically was it in the spec kind of technically was it in the spec kind of all along, right?

Yeah. One other interesting metric uh that One other interesting metric uh that One other interesting metric uh that Jonathan had actually pointed out to me Jonathan had actually pointed out to me Jonathan had actually pointed out to me earlier this week in 2025, this is so earlier this week in 2025, this is so earlier this week in 2025, this is so far at least the first time ever where far at least the first time ever where far at least the first time ever where we have CNAs that are actually out we have CNAs that are actually out we have CNAs that are actually out publishing MITER for the first time. So publishing MITER for the first time. So publishing MITER for the first time. So in terms of growth, that's pretty huge. in terms of growth, that's pretty huge. in terms of growth, that's pretty huge. Again, I never know if this is a good Again, I never know if this is a good Again, I never know if this is a good stat to brag about or not, right? Like stat to brag about or not, right? Like stat to brag about or not, right? Like it's it's a matter of scale, I guess. it's it's a matter of scale, I guess. it's it's a matter of scale, I guess. But yeah, that is cool. the the But yeah, that is cool. the the But yeah, that is cool. the the community does seem to be growing more community does seem to be growing more community does seem to be growing more people. Um, even in the last month or people. Um, even in the last month or people. Um, even in the last month or two on like the CNA Slack, like I feel two on like the CNA Slack, like I feel two on like the CNA Slack, like I feel like I've seen more activity starting to like I've seen more activity starting to like I've seen more activity starting to tick up just in my short time there. So, tick up just in my short time there. So, tick up just in my short time there. So, very much a an alive community and very much a an alive community and very much a an alive community and everyone is very nice, right? I was everyone is very nice, right? I was everyone is very nice, right? I was worried that I didn't know enough when I worried that I didn't know enough when I worried that I didn't know enough when I jumped in, which was definitely true. jumped in, which was definitely true. jumped in, which was definitely true. Um, but people help me find kind of the Um, but people help me find kind of the Um, but people help me find kind of the areas I naturally could contribute in. areas I naturally could contribute in. areas I naturally could contribute in. So, if you're hesitant at all, reach So, if you're hesitant at all, reach So, if you're hesitant at all, reach out, out, out, join. All right, back to a few more join. All right, back to a few more join. All right, back to a few more stats. stats. stats. These are really really tiny. So use the These are really really tiny. So use the These are really really tiny. So use the uh the the link in the Discord if you uh the the link in the Discord if you uh the the link in the Discord if you want to see it better. But you can see want to see it better. But you can see want to see it better. But you can see where the graph really starts to change, where the graph really starts to change, where the graph really starts to change, right? Um around 2016, right? The 2016 right? Um around 2016, right? The 2016 right? Um around 2016, right? The 2016 year still finishes out at year still finishes out at year still finishes out at 6437. It pretty much doubles the next 6437. It pretty much doubles the next 6437. It pretty much doubles the next year at 18 1983 1954 something in there. year at 18 1983 1954 something in there. year at 18 1983 1954 something in there. Pretty close to double on it. So and Pretty close to double on it. So and Pretty close to double on it. So and then from there we keep growing. Uh, you then from there we keep growing. Uh, you then from there we keep growing. Uh, you know, a fun fact about that is that the know, a fun fact about that is that the know, a fun fact about that is that the CBE ID used to have only four numbers at CBE ID used to have only four numbers at CBE ID used to have only four numbers at the end. Kind of the when when it went the end. Kind of the when when it went the end. Kind of the when when it went to unlimited numbers at the end, that's to unlimited numbers at the end, that's to unlimited numbers at the end, that's when the numbers started growing. Funny when the numbers started growing. Funny when the numbers started growing. Funny about that. Weird, right? Weird. I also about that. Weird, right? Weird. I also about that. Weird, right? Weird. I also heard that um MITER was, you know, the heard that um MITER was, you know, the heard that um MITER was, you know, the CVE project was, you know, holding it CVE project was, you know, holding it CVE project was, you know, holding it back or dismissing CVES because they back or dismissing CVES because they back or dismissing CVES because they were worried about hitting that limit, were worried about hitting that limit, were worried about hitting that limit, right? right? right? Yeah. It was a sore subject. So Yeah. It was a sore subject. So Yeah. It was a sore subject. So interesting conversations about interesting conversations about interesting conversations about that. All right. And then uh yeah the that. All right. And then uh yeah the that. All right. And then uh yeah the CNA program. So this is interesting too. CNA program. So this is interesting too. CNA program. So this is interesting too. We can see that line clearly uh breaking We can see that line clearly uh breaking We can see that line clearly uh breaking up there. CNA's added is the the the up there. CNA's added is the the the up there. CNA's added is the the the blue line. The cumulative is the orange blue line. The cumulative is the orange blue line. The cumulative is the orange line. So not as much growth last year as line. So not as much growth last year as line. So not as much growth last year as I would expect especially for the number I would expect especially for the number I would expect especially for the number of CDs uh published. But it also means of CDs uh published. But it also means of CDs uh published. But it also means that probably a lot of the major people that probably a lot of the major people that probably a lot of the major people that are in that are in that are in there. Oh, and there's our slide again. there. Oh, and there's our slide again. there. Oh, and there's our slide again. All All All right, now we're going to open up. This right, now we're going to open up. This right, now we're going to open up. This is where we go off road a little bit. is where we go off road a little bit. is where we go off road a little bit. We've got some fun questions in the We've got some fun questions in the We've got some fun questions in the canon, but we'd love to hear more from, canon, but we'd love to hear more from, canon, but we'd love to hear more from, you know, anybody who's curious about you know, anybody who's curious about you know, anybody who's curious about about the program in general. Don't feel about the program in general. Don't feel about the program in general. Don't feel bad because everybody raised their hand bad because everybody raised their hand bad because everybody raised their hand or most people raised their hand. Um, or or most people raised their hand. Um, or or most people raised their hand. Um, or discuss pain points and everything discuss pain points and everything discuss pain points and everything else.

Do CNAs and is there a among each other? Do CNAs and is there a among each other? Do CNAs and is there a quality check? Do CNAs coordinate quality check? Do CNAs coordinate quality check? Do CNAs coordinate amongst each other and is there a amongst each other and is there a amongst each other and is there a quality check? Lot lots of CNAs converge on working Lot lots of CNAs converge on working Lot lots of CNAs converge on working groups which is highly encouraged. If groups which is highly encouraged. If groups which is highly encouraged. If you care about quality working group or you care about quality working group or you care about quality working group or the automation or or the marketing of the automation or or the marketing of the automation or or the marketing of this program itself, we've got working this program itself, we've got working this program itself, we've got working group probably eight working groups uh a group probably eight working groups uh a group probably eight working groups uh a new AI working group. So there's a lot new AI working group. So there's a lot new AI working group. So there's a lot of coordination there. There's a Slack of coordination there. There's a Slack of coordination there. There's a Slack channel for CNAs which which is fun. And channel for CNAs which which is fun. And channel for CNAs which which is fun. And um also one of the working groups is um also one of the working groups is um also one of the working groups is called Coupe and is run by Todd. And so called Coupe and is run by Todd. And so called Coupe and is run by Todd. And so that's just a place for CNAs to come and that's just a place for CNAs to come and that's just a place for CNAs to come and hang out and chat about being a CNA. So hang out and chat about being a CNA. So hang out and chat about being a CNA. So there is a lot of coordination. Oh, some some non-plant in the audience Oh, some some non-plant in the audience Oh, some some non-plant in the audience mentioned that the board has a CNA mentioned that the board has a CNA mentioned that the board has a CNA liaison and it happens to be MZ who's liaison and it happens to be MZ who's liaison and it happens to be MZ who's where that sound came from. So, yeah, where that sound came from. So, yeah, where that sound came from. So, yeah, CNA liaison. Yeah. So, so keeping the CNA liaison. Yeah. So, so keeping the CNA liaison. Yeah. So, so keeping the board obviously there's a lot of pieces board obviously there's a lot of pieces board obviously there's a lot of pieces at play now. So, keep the board up to at play now. So, keep the board up to at play now. So, keep the board up to date and kind of bridging between the date and kind of bridging between the date and kind of bridging between the two groups uh is is pretty much a two groups uh is is pretty much a two groups uh is is pretty much a full-time job and MC does that. We got a full-time job and MC does that. We got a full-time job and MC does that. We got a question in the back there. question in the back there. question in the back there. Question from Discord um for the Question from Discord um for the Question from Discord um for the panelists um about how many number of panelists um about how many number of panelists um about how many number of CVEes do each of your CNAs assign per CVEes do each of your CNAs assign per CVEes do each of your CNAs assign per year? year? year? Per year. Per year. Per year. The highest number for Microsoft was The highest number for Microsoft was The highest number for Microsoft was 2020. We assigned just over 1,200. Uh 2020. We assigned just over 1,200. Uh 2020. We assigned just over 1,200. Uh since then we're we're inching back up since then we're we're inching back up since then we're we're inching back up to 12,200. But I think people had a lot to 12,200. But I think people had a lot to 12,200. But I think people had a lot of time to find problems, of time to find problems, of time to find problems, vulnerabilities during their off time vulnerabilities during their off time vulnerabilities during their off time during the pandemic. during the pandemic. during the pandemic. Yeah, I'm I'm not going to tell you how Yeah, I'm I'm not going to tell you how Yeah, I'm I'm not going to tell you how many sign per year because they're not many sign per year because they're not many sign per year because they're not all patched yet, but um disclose eight all patched yet, but um disclose eight all patched yet, but um disclose eight around 800. How GitHub? How GitHub? How GitHub? I've only been in GitHub a year, so I I've only been in GitHub a year, so I I've only been in GitHub a year, so I don't know the full I was about to say don't know the full I was about to say don't know the full I was about to say it was I think it's like 2200 was last it was I think it's like 2200 was last it was I think it's like 2200 was last year. Great. Uh before that I was at year. Great. Uh before that I was at year. Great. Uh before that I was at MITER and it was you know six or 7,000. MITER and it was you know six or 7,000. MITER and it was you know six or 7,000. But was it LA? Oh yeah. This year But was it LA? Oh yeah. This year But was it LA? Oh yeah. This year though, we're outpacing MITER already. though, we're outpacing MITER already. though, we're outpacing MITER already. Right. Within the first quarter, there Right. Within the first quarter, there Right. Within the first quarter, there is a CNA who outpaces MITER. Yes. is a CNA who outpaces MITER. Yes. is a CNA who outpaces MITER. Yes. Awesome. Do you know who it is? Can we Awesome. Do you know who it is? Can we Awesome. Do you know who it is? Can we say patch stack? Patch stack. Sweet. I say patch stack? Patch stack. Sweet. I say patch stack? Patch stack. Sweet. I think now MITER writes 17% of the CNA think now MITER writes 17% of the CNA think now MITER writes 17% of the CNA CVE. CVE. CVE. It used to be 100%. Yeah. And the goal It used to be 100%. Yeah. And the goal It used to be 100%. Yeah. And the goal is to keep shrinking that and federate is to keep shrinking that and federate is to keep shrinking that and federate more, right? Where where applicable. Um, more, right? Where where applicable. Um, more, right? Where where applicable. Um, as far as her devs goes, I don't as far as her devs goes, I don't as far as her devs goes, I don't actually know that stat partially actually know that stat partially actually know that stat partially because we only support uh Oh, yeah. because we only support uh Oh, yeah. because we only support uh Oh, yeah. I've got friend in the back putting up I've got friend in the back putting up I've got friend in the back putting up like 10. Um, but we only support end of like 10. Um, but we only support end of like 10. Um, but we only support end of life open source software. So, usually life open source software. So, usually life open source software. So, usually there's CVS that exist. If anything, we there's CVS that exist. If anything, we there's CVS that exist. If anything, we just got to update the range to like just got to update the range to like just got to update the range to like include it so you know it accurately include it so you know it accurately include it so you know it accurately says it. But we do find the occasional. says it. But we do find the occasional. says it. But we do find the occasional. So So So speaking of open source, do you have any speaking of open source, do you have any speaking of open source, do you have any initiatives to help the open source initiatives to help the open source initiatives to help the open source community proactively open up CVEes and community proactively open up CVEes and community proactively open up CVEes and make it easier for them because they make it easier for them because they make it easier for them because they don't have a lot of time, they don't don't have a lot of time, they don't don't have a lot of time, they don't necessarily have a lot of resources and necessarily have a lot of resources and necessarily have a lot of resources and they may not have knowledge. they may not have knowledge. they may not have knowledge. Well, yeah, if your project's on GitHub, Well, yeah, if your project's on GitHub, Well, yeah, if your project's on GitHub, you can request a CV through GitHub. you can request a CV through GitHub. you can request a CV through GitHub. We'll do everything. Yeah, we we manage We'll do everything. Yeah, we we manage We'll do everything. Yeah, we we manage the entire process. If it's not on process. If it's not on process. If it's not on GitHub, talk to Red Hat. Red Hat is is GitHub, talk to Red Hat. Red Hat is is GitHub, talk to Red Hat. Red Hat is is the root for for o all open source that the root for for o all open source that the root for for o all open source that isn't in anybody else's scope. So, you isn't in anybody else's scope. So, you isn't in anybody else's scope. So, you can also always go to Red Hat. Ah, yeah. can also always go to Red Hat. Ah, yeah. can also always go to Red Hat. Ah, yeah. This is Dave. Oh, sorry. Just because This is Dave. Oh, sorry. Just because This is Dave. Oh, sorry. Just because it's important to clarify this if if you it's important to clarify this if if you it's important to clarify this if if you don't mind. Um, Red Hat is a route. Red don't mind. Um, Red Hat is a route. Red don't mind. Um, Red Hat is a route. Red Hat is the route for CNAs that choose to Hat is the route for CNAs that choose to Hat is the route for CNAs that choose to be under them. If you wish to be a CNA be under them. If you wish to be a CNA be under them. If you wish to be a CNA under Red Hat, you can approach them and under Red Hat, you can approach them and under Red Hat, you can approach them and talk with them about it. If you're open talk with them about it. If you're open talk with them about it. If you're open source, you don't have to be under Red source, you don't have to be under Red source, you don't have to be under Red Hat. Hat. Hat. Thanks. Thank you. Yeah, that's good to Thanks. Thank you. Yeah, that's good to Thanks. Thank you. Yeah, that's good to know. Yeah, here here it is. We're we're know. Yeah, here here it is. We're we're know. Yeah, here here it is. We're we're in a little bit of a different in a little bit of a different in a little bit of a different situation, too, because again, we don't situation, too, because again, we don't situation, too, because again, we don't make anything, right? We we build things make anything, right? We we build things make anything, right? We we build things that people usually already have. Um, that people usually already have. Um, that people usually already have. Um, but there's an interesting phenomenon but there's an interesting phenomenon but there's an interesting phenomenon where people don't file CVES anymore for where people don't file CVES anymore for where people don't file CVES anymore for end of life stuff. It's kind of the end of life stuff. It's kind of the end of life stuff. It's kind of the whole reason we we eol things. So, our whole reason we we eol things. So, our whole reason we we eol things. So, our scope, we we really had to figure out a scope, we we really had to figure out a scope, we we really had to figure out a way to like make us fit the program in a way to like make us fit the program in a way to like make us fit the program in a way that if the technology originates way that if the technology originates way that if the technology originates from, you know, a project that doesn't from, you know, a project that doesn't from, you know, a project that doesn't have a CNA of record and or we can't have a CNA of record and or we can't have a CNA of record and or we can't find them or they're not active or find them or they're not active or find them or they're not active or whatever, then we can get involved and whatever, then we can get involved and whatever, then we can get involved and help do that. But I will say if you're help do that. But I will say if you're help do that. But I will say if you're in any open source project, whether in any open source project, whether in any open source project, whether you're on GitHub or not, if you're on you're on GitHub or not, if you're on you're on GitHub or not, if you're on GitHub, talk to GitHub. That's good. Uh GitHub, talk to GitHub. That's good. Uh GitHub, talk to GitHub. That's good. Uh if not though, we'd love to help. Sorry, if not though, we'd love to help. Sorry, if not though, we'd love to help. Sorry, what's that? GitLab is also a CNA. So, what's that? GitLab is also a CNA. So, what's that? GitLab is also a CNA. So, and if you're not on either of those and and if you're not on either of those and and if you're not on either of those and company or company setup, then we should company or company setup, then we should company or company setup, then we should talk. Anybody else? Any other comments talk. Anybody else? Any other comments talk. Anybody else? Any other comments on that? Any more questions? a potential question over here. a potential question over here. a potential question over here. Yeah, two of them. Yeah, two of them. Yeah, two of them. Hi. Hi. Um, I have a question actually Hi. Hi. Um, I have a question actually Hi. Hi. Um, I have a question actually for my some of my head researchers. Uh, for my some of my head researchers. Uh, for my some of my head researchers. Uh, so I'm going to so I'm going to so I'm going to I'm going to just uh read it. Uh so CV I'm going to just uh read it. Uh so CV I'm going to just uh read it. Uh so CV identifiers appear to get more frequent identifiers appear to get more frequent identifiers appear to get more frequent frequently assigned without taking frequently assigned without taking frequently assigned without taking actual exploitability into account actual exploitability into account actual exploitability into account resulting in apparent over reporting of resulting in apparent over reporting of resulting in apparent over reporting of CV CV CV identifiers. Are these or are there any identifiers. Are these or are there any identifiers. Are these or are there any intentions to improve the quality of CVS intentions to improve the quality of CVS intentions to improve the quality of CVS with respect to that and have CNAs with respect to that and have CNAs with respect to that and have CNAs account for all the vulnerability account for all the vulnerability account for all the vulnerability aspects like exploitability? aspects like exploitability? aspects like exploitability? Are you saying that the applicability, Are you saying that the applicability, Are you saying that the applicability, the severity of something is a hotly the severity of something is a hotly the severity of something is a hotly debated issue in pretty much every CV debated issue in pretty much every CV debated issue in pretty much every CV that comes around and everybody who that comes around and everybody who that comes around and everybody who consumes it? Yeah, I'm not going to call consumes it? Yeah, I'm not going to call consumes it? Yeah, I'm not going to call names, but um there is there is a names, but um there is there is a names, but um there is there is a specifically one CNA or vendor out there specifically one CNA or vendor out there specifically one CNA or vendor out there that is really flooding aggressively that is really flooding aggressively that is really flooding aggressively putting things out. Yeah. And it's and putting things out. Yeah. And it's and putting things out. Yeah. And it's and and most of them are, you know, rejected and most of them are, you know, rejected and most of them are, you know, rejected by default. Are they are they for by default. Are they are they for by default. Are they are they for specific products or open source specific products or open source specific products or open source products? Can I ask? products? Can I ask? products? Can I ask? Yeah. Can Okay, so it starts from an Yeah. Can Okay, so it starts from an Yeah. Can Okay, so it starts from an above. Yeah. Anyway, so essentially it's above. Yeah. Anyway, so essentially it's above. Yeah. Anyway, so essentially it's about CNAs not doing their job and about CNAs not doing their job and about CNAs not doing their job and assigning CVs for garbage. Sorry, his assigning CVs for garbage. Sorry, his assigning CVs for garbage. Sorry, his words, not mine. Mitra approves the CNA. words, not mine. Mitra approves the CNA. words, not mine. Mitra approves the CNA. So if a CNA is not working properly, it So if a CNA is not working properly, it So if a CNA is not working properly, it should be a concern for Mitra. should be a concern for Mitra. should be a concern for Mitra. I think I know who asked the question I think I know who asked the question I think I know who asked the question even. But you know, so one of the things even. But you know, so one of the things even. But you know, so one of the things is have you brought this up with MITER is have you brought this up with MITER is have you brought this up with MITER would be my first question. would be my first question. would be my first question. Um, as far as I know, there's not been Um, as far as I know, there's not been Um, as far as I know, there's not been any push to uh require the CNAs validate any push to uh require the CNAs validate any push to uh require the CNAs validate exploitability before exploitability before exploitability before publishing. publishing. publishing. Um, that would be difficult for many of Um, that would be difficult for many of Um, that would be difficult for many of the CNAs. I would say, you know, the the CNAs. I would say, you know, the the CNAs. I would say, you know, the GitHub CNA doesn't validate everything. GitHub CNA doesn't validate everything. GitHub CNA doesn't validate everything. We assume that the maintainers who We assume that the maintainers who We assume that the maintainers who request write CVS from us have. request write CVS from us have. request write CVS from us have. I'd say that the CVE I'd say that the CVE I'd say that the CVE program relies on peer pressure to some program relies on peer pressure to some program relies on peer pressure to some degree to to keep the CBES at high degree to to keep the CBES at high degree to to keep the CBES at high quality. And this particular CV CNA that quality. And this particular CV CNA that quality. And this particular CV CNA that I think you're referring to has gotten a I think you're referring to has gotten a I think you're referring to has gotten a lot of peer pressure lately. And and I lot of peer pressure lately. And and I lot of peer pressure lately. And and I think that it will work over time, but think that it will work over time, but think that it will work over time, but they might be a little bit stubborn. But they might be a little bit stubborn. But they might be a little bit stubborn. But I I think a lot of us a lot of us uh try I I think a lot of us a lot of us uh try I I think a lot of us a lot of us uh try to encourage other CNAs to do the right to encourage other CNAs to do the right to encourage other CNAs to do the right thing hopefully. Thank you thing hopefully. Thank you thing hopefully. Thank you Madison. Madison. Madison. Yeah, we actually have the question Yeah, we actually have the question Yeah, we actually have the question here. Oh, you're here. Oh, you're here. Oh, you're hi everybody. My name is Madison. I'm hi everybody. My name is Madison. I'm hi everybody. My name is Madison. I'm from GitHub. I manage our CNA. Um, I'd from GitHub. I manage our CNA. Um, I'd from GitHub. I manage our CNA. Um, I'd say to this point too, if if there are say to this point too, if if there are say to this point too, if if there are CNAs that are are actively acting badly CNAs that are are actively acting badly CNAs that are are actively acting badly and or violating the rules, these are and or violating the rules, these are and or violating the rules, these are definitely things that we also talk definitely things that we also talk definitely things that we also talk about at the board level and do take about at the board level and do take about at the board level and do take action on. There have been CNAs that action on. There have been CNAs that action on. There have been CNAs that have been removed from the program in have been removed from the program in have been removed from the program in the past. So, it's not that these are the past. So, it's not that these are the past. So, it's not that these are unheard of by any means. Um, we try to unheard of by any means. Um, we try to unheard of by any means. Um, we try to be open and accepting and and understand be open and accepting and and understand be open and accepting and and understand that the program is not perfect either. that the program is not perfect either. that the program is not perfect either. So, we want to improve where we can to So, we want to improve where we can to So, we want to improve where we can to better support folks like that. You better support folks like that. You better support folks like that. You know, we want to make a determination. know, we want to make a determination. know, we want to make a determination. are they making a mistake? Are they are they making a mistake? Are they are they making a mistake? Are they trying to fit into a system that wasn't trying to fit into a system that wasn't trying to fit into a system that wasn't made for them? Should we as CVE be doing made for them? Should we as CVE be doing made for them? Should we as CVE be doing something better? Uh so it's really a something better? Uh so it's really a something better? Uh so it's really a discussion and a dialogue uh across all discussion and a dialogue uh across all discussion and a dialogue uh across all of that. of that. of that. Um but so I would say if you have any Um but so I would say if you have any Um but so I would say if you have any examples of that, definitely let examples of that, definitely let examples of that, definitely let leadership know this. These are things leadership know this. These are things leadership know this. These are things that we talk about very very regularly. that we talk about very very regularly. that we talk about very very regularly. These are things that are brought up These are things that are brought up These are things that are brought up pretty consistently. Uh and I'm sure if pretty consistently. Uh and I'm sure if pretty consistently. Uh and I'm sure if you've identified an issue, there's a you've identified an issue, there's a you've identified an issue, there's a there's a good chance somebody else has there's a good chance somebody else has there's a good chance somebody else has too. And there's a non-zero chance that too. And there's a non-zero chance that too. And there's a non-zero chance that we may already be discussing it as well. Oh, that's a good question. What is the Oh, that's a good question. What is the Oh, that's a good question. What is the best way to notify us? Hi, sorry Dave Morse from MITER. Um, so Hi, sorry Dave Morse from MITER.

Um, so if you go to cb.org, there's something if you go to cb.org, there's something if you go to cb.org, there's something called the partner list and you'll find called the partner list and you'll find called the partner list and you'll find the names of the CB CNAs on that partner the names of the CB CNAs on that partner the names of the CB CNAs on that partner list and it'll tell you how to contact list and it'll tell you how to contact list and it'll tell you how to contact them. They've either got a contact form them. They've either got a contact form them. They've either got a contact form or an email and their disclosure policy. or an email and their disclosure policy. or an email and their disclosure policy. They'd also say who is their root and They'd also say who is their root and They'd also say who is their root and then you look up that route in the then you look up that route in the then you look up that route in the partner list and you use their public partner list and you use their public partner list and you use their public contact from the partner page on contact from the partner page on contact from the partner page on cbee.org to help cbee.org to help cbee.org to help and then I'm going to ask a hotly and then I'm going to ask a hotly and then I'm going to ask a hotly contested question. I think that the contested question. I think that the contested question. I think that the answers Oh, well the questions we had answers Oh, well the questions we had answers Oh, well the questions we had over here got answered. Okay, in the over here got answered. Okay, in the over here got answered. Okay, in the general conversation. Good job. So, so general conversation. Good job. So, so general conversation. Good job. So, so if the root doesn't take corrective if the root doesn't take corrective if the root doesn't take corrective action or there's still a disagreement, action or there's still a disagreement, action or there's still a disagreement, what do we do then? Where does where do what do we do then? Where does where do what do we do then? Where does where do things go from there? things go from there? things go from there? Just just throw it out. Nobody the email Just just throw it out. Nobody the email Just just throw it out. Nobody the email goes dead and nobody keeps talking. goes dead and nobody keeps talking. goes dead and nobody keeps talking. A council of roots. A council of roots. A council of roots. There there's a council of roots run by There there's a council of roots run by There there's a council of roots run by Dave. Call me for everything. No. Um so if a Call me for everything. No. Um so if a Call me for everything. No. Um so if a root is not doing their job of root is not doing their job of root is not doing their job of governance, which is when a when they governance, which is when a when they governance, which is when a when they agree to be a root, they agree to govern agree to be a root, they agree to govern agree to be a root, they agree to govern the CNAs under them. Then you go to the CNAs under them. Then you go to the CNAs under them. Then you go to their top level route. There are only their top level route. There are only their top level route. There are only two of those right now, right? MITER is two of those right now, right? MITER is two of those right now, right? MITER is top level route for many of the the top level route for many of the the top level route for many of the the every partner in a big section of the every partner in a big section of the every partner in a big section of the program and SISA is a top level route. program and SISA is a top level route. program and SISA is a top level route. SISA under DHS with US government is a SISA under DHS with US government is a SISA under DHS with US government is a top level route for a section of CNAs. top level route for a section of CNAs. top level route for a section of CNAs. So the top level roots are required to So the top level roots are required to So the top level roots are required to enforce governance on everybody below enforce governance on everybody below enforce governance on everybody below them. And then of course if you're not them. And then of course if you're not them. And then of course if you're not getting satisfaction with your getting satisfaction with your getting satisfaction with your complaints about that part of the complaints about that part of the complaints about that part of the hierarchy, you can go to the CBE board. hierarchy, you can go to the CBE board. hierarchy, you can go to the CBE board. Is that email available on the website Is that email available on the website Is that email available on the website too? too? too? How do you get how do you go to the How do you get how do you go to the How do you get how do you go to the board? If you got this, board? If you got this, board? If you got this, you call Dave. We have his cell phone you call Dave. We have his cell phone you call Dave. We have his cell phone number on the last slide. Okay. Gotcha. It shouldn't dead end. Okay. Gotcha. It shouldn't dead end. Okay. Gotcha. It shouldn't dead end. Just email coie atminer.org and it'll Just email coie atminer.org and it'll Just email coie atminer.org and it'll it'll get there. We're going to get in it'll get there. We're going to get in it'll get there. We're going to get in trouble up trouble up trouble up here. Question over here. Sorry, there's one on Discord. Um, do Sorry, there's one on Discord. Um, do Sorry, there's one on Discord. Um, do you all have any examples of CNAs that you all have any examples of CNAs that you all have any examples of CNAs that have been removed from the program? We might even look to Dave for that. No, We might even look to Dave for that. No, We might even look to Dave for that. No, maybe maybe maybe the the thing about removing CNAs is the the the thing about removing CNAs is the the the thing about removing CNAs is the the program always wants to work with the program always wants to work with the program always wants to work with you if you want to work with us. And if you if you want to work with us. And if you if you want to work with us. And if we if the board if MITER reaches we if the board if MITER reaches we if the board if MITER reaches out once, twice, three times, we give out once, twice, three times, we give out once, twice, three times, we give like six months. I mean, it's it's a like six months. I mean, it's it's a like six months. I mean, it's it's a long period of time. But if they refuse long period of time. But if they refuse long period of time. But if they refuse to respond, then we just send an email to respond, then we just send an email to respond, then we just send an email saying you're out. They can still saying you're out. They can still saying you're out. They can still probably come back because we always probably come back because we always probably come back because we always give people hugs. give people hugs. give people hugs. It is it is a government adjacent It is it is a government adjacent It is it is a government adjacent organization and project so it doesn't organization and project so it doesn't organization and project so it doesn't move fast. You've got time to clean up move fast. You've got time to clean up move fast. You've got time to clean up your behavior. Um from my point of view your behavior. Um from my point of view your behavior. Um from my point of view being a newer CNA um I there's there's being a newer CNA um I there's there's being a newer CNA um I there's there's issues there's people that don't agree issues there's people that don't agree issues there's people that don't agree on things right there's a Slack for on things right there's a Slack for on things right there's a Slack for CNAs. So if any of you are not on the CNAs. So if any of you are not on the CNAs. So if any of you are not on the CNA slack go on there you can ask CNA slack go on there you can ask CNA slack go on there you can ask questions. It helps you from doing very questions. It helps you from doing very questions. It helps you from doing very embarrassing you know CVES that embarrassing you know CVES that embarrassing you know CVES that everyone's going to yell at you for. Um everyone's going to yell at you for. Um everyone's going to yell at you for. Um I have not come across or seen very many I have not come across or seen very many I have not come across or seen very many instances of you know disagreements or instances of you know disagreements or instances of you know disagreements or you know unsolvable problems that you know unsolvable problems that you know unsolvable problems that there's a lot of compromise on. There there's a lot of compromise on. There there's a lot of compromise on. There are a couple things going on recently are a couple things going on recently are a couple things going on recently but yeah but yeah but yeah uh microphone. Oh yeah. So uh just a uh microphone. Oh yeah. So uh just a uh microphone. Oh yeah. So uh just a quick question here. So I understand quick question here. So I understand quick question here. So I understand that the board is in charge of leading that the board is in charge of leading that the board is in charge of leading the direction of the project. There's the direction of the project. There's the direction of the project. There's working groups that you can join to sort working groups that you can join to sort working groups that you can join to sort of be involved and then uh as you of be involved and then uh as you of be involved and then uh as you mentioned there's Slack rooms as well. I mentioned there's Slack rooms as well. I mentioned there's Slack rooms as well. I guess I'm just curious if there's any guess I'm just curious if there's any guess I'm just curious if there's any other alternative sources or uh other alternative sources or uh other alternative sources or uh activities that you would recommend CNAs activities that you would recommend CNAs activities that you would recommend CNAs participate in to be more connected with participate in to be more connected with participate in to be more connected with the project or be more affiliated with the project or be more affiliated with the project or be more affiliated with what's going on in the world of CVE. How do people get started? You guys are How do people get started? You guys are How do people get started? You guys are steeped in it. So join I mean the the fact is that working join I mean the the fact is that working join I mean the the fact is that working groups are usually once a week or once groups are usually once a week or once groups are usually once a week or once every two weeks. you can kind of dip in every two weeks. you can kind of dip in every two weeks. you can kind of dip in and dip out and if they're talking about and dip out and if they're talking about and dip out and if they're talking about something you're interested in then by something you're interested in then by something you're interested in then by all means get involved and volunteer. all means get involved and volunteer. all means get involved and volunteer. The coupe is always a good good place The coupe is always a good good place The coupe is always a good good place because that basically there's no real because that basically there's no real because that basically there's no real requirements. You just got to come and requirements. You just got to come and requirements. You just got to come and hang out and and be friendly with Todd. hang out and and be friendly with Todd. hang out and and be friendly with Todd. A CNA. Yes, a CNA. But he was weren't A CNA. Yes, a CNA. But he was weren't A CNA. Yes, a CNA. But he was weren't you asking about CNAs? How to get more? you asking about CNAs? How to get more? you asking about CNAs? How to get more? Yes. From the perspective of a CNA, how Yes. From the perspective of a CNA, how Yes. From the perspective of a CNA, how would a CNA be more actively involved in would a CNA be more actively involved in would a CNA be more actively involved in the project itself? the project itself? the project itself? the the fact is that I I'm the co-chair the the fact is that I I'm the co-chair the the fact is that I I'm the co-chair of the TWWG and before I was co-chair of of the TWWG and before I was co-chair of of the TWWG and before I was co-chair of the which is the tactical working group the which is the tactical working group the which is the tactical working group kind of operational thing and um before kind of operational thing and um before kind of operational thing and um before that I was involved I'd go to board that I was involved I'd go to board that I was involved I'd go to board meetings because I've been on the board meetings because I've been on the board meetings because I've been on the board since 2018 but after I really started since 2018 but after I really started since 2018 but after I really started digging in into the into that working digging in into the into that working digging in into the into that working group I just became more and more group I just became more and more group I just became more and more enthusiastic and just spend a lot enthusiastic and just spend a lot enthusiastic and just spend a lot probably more time than Microsoft even probably more time than Microsoft even probably more time than Microsoft even would appreciate that I that I spend on would appreciate that I that I spend on would appreciate that I that I spend on this program because there's a lot of this program because there's a lot of this program because there's a lot of work to do. There's a lot of shaping the work to do. There's a lot of shaping the work to do. There's a lot of shaping the future that you can do if you're active future that you can do if you're active future that you can do if you're active and if you care about it, jump in. Okay. and if you care about it, jump in. Okay. and if you care about it, jump in. Okay. Wonderful. And I guess slight followup Wonderful. And I guess slight followup Wonderful. And I guess slight followup to that is that um I've seen some to that is that um I've seen some to that is that um I've seen some surveys come in for CNAs as well. Um surveys come in for CNAs as well. Um surveys come in for CNAs as well. Um this is a dumb question, but I guess this is a dumb question, but I guess this is a dumb question, but I guess like how heavily are those surveys like how heavily are those surveys like how heavily are those surveys factored in into you know the feedback factored in into you know the feedback factored in into you know the feedback that you receive from those? Heavily. that you receive from those? Heavily. that you receive from those? Heavily. Yeah. Sweet. I' I've been watching those Yeah. Sweet. I' I've been watching those Yeah. Sweet. I' I've been watching those come together for a long time. They're come together for a long time. They're come together for a long time. They're hotly debated and want to be, you know, hotly debated and want to be, you know, hotly debated and want to be, you know, they want to get it really accurate to they want to get it really accurate to they want to get it really accurate to the point that there's been several the point that there's been several the point that there's been several meetings about one question just to get meetings about one question just to get meetings about one question just to get it right, you know, because it's got a it right, you know, because it's got a it right, you know, because it's got a whole tree of things. So, yeah. Yeah. whole tree of things. So, yeah. Yeah. whole tree of things. So, yeah. Yeah. The the other thing about um The the other thing about um The the other thing about um participating if you can't make like the participating if you can't make like the participating if you can't make like the the working group meetings, uh many of the working group meetings, uh many of the working group meetings, uh many of the working groups um do their work on the working groups um do their work on the working groups um do their work on GitHub. There's several GitHub repos and GitHub. There's several GitHub repos and GitHub. There's several GitHub repos and if you want to participate through that, if you want to participate through that, if you want to participate through that, uh they definitely appreciate it. And if uh they definitely appreciate it. And if uh they definitely appreciate it. And if you don't like the technical you don't like the technical you don't like the technical infrastructure and stuff, like it's all infrastructure and stuff, like it's all infrastructure and stuff, like it's all on GitHub and I was kind of worried it on GitHub and I was kind of worried it on GitHub and I was kind of worried it would be a hard project to get into. would be a hard project to get into. would be a hard project to get into. It's really easy. Like there's there's It's really easy. Like there's there's It's really easy. Like there's there's there's not a lot of terribly there's not a lot of terribly there's not a lot of terribly sophisticated or scary corners to hide sophisticated or scary corners to hide sophisticated or scary corners to hide out. So you've got no reason to complain out. So you've got no reason to complain out. So you've got no reason to complain without offering a solution is what I'm without offering a solution is what I'm without offering a solution is what I'm saying. saying. saying. One thing I do now as a CNA is once a One thing I do now as a CNA is once a One thing I do now as a CNA is once a month I'll go back and read the naming month I'll go back and read the naming month I'll go back and read the naming rules again so that I don't miss rules again so that I don't miss rules again so that I don't miss anything because there's there's been anything because there's there's been anything because there's there's been times in my career where I I go to one times in my career where I I go to one times in my career where I I go to one of these when we used to just have like of these when we used to just have like of these when we used to just have like the summits or whatever and there was 20 the summits or whatever and there was 20 the summits or whatever and there was 20 people in a room and somebody at MIT people in a room and somebody at MIT people in a room and somebody at MIT would come up and say you know you're would come up and say you know you're would come up and say you know you're supposed to be doing you know you're supposed to be doing you know you're supposed to be doing you know you're supposed to be putting versions into the supposed to be putting versions into the supposed to be putting versions into the description. It's like I was description. It's like I was description. It's like I was Oh, I'll start I'll start doing that Oh, I'll start I'll start doing that Oh, I'll start I'll start doing that now. But you're keeping keeping up to now. But you're keeping keeping up to now. But you're keeping keeping up to date with with what the what the board's date with with what the what the board's date with with what the what the board's doing and what the the working groups doing and what the the working groups doing and what the the working groups are working on is yeah very very helpful are working on is yeah very very helpful are working on is yeah very very helpful and it and it's nuance so it's easy to and it and it's nuance so it's easy to and it and it's nuance so it's easy to slip. Yeah. Uh the other thing is the slip. Yeah. Uh the other thing is the slip. Yeah. Uh the other thing is the minutes for the board meetings are uh minutes for the board meetings are uh minutes for the board meetings are uh posted so you can keep up with what the posted so you can keep up with what the posted so you can keep up with what the board is thinking board is thinking board is thinking about and there's not too much about and there's not too much about and there's not too much information. It's not a lot of fluff. information. It's not a lot of fluff. information. It's not a lot of fluff. Like when I joined I was worried that it Like when I joined I was worried that it Like when I joined I was worried that it would be a lot of reading to kind of get would be a lot of reading to kind of get would be a lot of reading to kind of get to the meat of things but really easy to to the meat of things but really easy to to the meat of things but really easy to jump in. Everybody's really friendly. We jump in. Everybody's really friendly. We jump in. Everybody's really friendly. We need lots of help. Jump in to the to the need lots of help. Jump in to the to the need lots of help. Jump in to the to the most patient woman in the crowd who has most patient woman in the crowd who has most patient woman in the crowd who has been waiting. for the online Discord people for the online Discord people for the online Discord people of a consumer of CVE records. I guess I of a consumer of CVE records. I guess I of a consumer of CVE records. I guess I have a general question about how have a general question about how have a general question about how standards are enforced amongst CNA standards are enforced amongst CNA standards are enforced amongst CNA members, how often they change because members, how often they change because members, how often they change because it feels like they're changing all the it feels like they're changing all the it feels like they're changing all the time. And is there like are standards time. And is there like are standards time. And is there like are standards coming from the top down and you guys coming from the top down and you guys coming from the top down and you guys just have to sort of follow them or do just have to sort of follow them or do just have to sort of follow them or do you guys actually talk amongst you guys actually talk amongst you guys actually talk amongst yourselves and and change things over yourselves and and change things over yourselves and and change things over time? time? time? I have thoughts but you guys go first. I have thoughts but you guys go first. I have thoughts but you guys go first. The we periodically rewrite the rules. The we periodically rewrite the rules. The we periodically rewrite the rules. The latest rules revision um took a The latest rules revision um took a The latest rules revision um took a couple years to get through because we couple years to get through because we couple years to get through because we kind of did a major overhaul of the kind of did a major overhaul of the kind of did a major overhaul of the entire document and structured it entire document and structured it entire document and structured it differently and had a lot of arguments differently and had a lot of arguments differently and had a lot of arguments and that sort of thing. And so that went and that sort of thing. And so that went and that sort of thing. And so that went into effect in August this year. The into effect in August this year. The into effect in August this year. The previous one I think was previous one I think was previous one I think was probably 2019. So it's you know once probably 2019. So it's you know once probably 2019. So it's you know once every five years we change the rules. every five years we change the rules. every five years we change the rules. But now, since we've overhauled the But now, since we've overhauled the But now, since we've overhauled the rules this time, I think there's going rules this time, I think there's going rules this time, I think there's going to be a lot more incremental changes, to be a lot more incremental changes, to be a lot more incremental changes, little baby changes along the way just little baby changes along the way just little baby changes along the way just to make them better as opposed to, you to make them better as opposed to, you to make them better as opposed to, you know, starting another three-year know, starting another three-year know, starting another three-year project. But you guys don't like go project. But you guys don't like go project. But you guys don't like go backport those changes to old records of backport those changes to old records of backport those changes to old records of old CVE. Yeah, I was going to say, are old CVE. Yeah, I was going to say, are old CVE. Yeah, I was going to say, are you talking about the the schema itself you talking about the the schema itself you talking about the the schema itself of the Yeah. of the Yeah. of the Yeah. fact there's a rule that says these fact there's a rule that says these fact there's a rule that says these changes should not be backported. So, changes should not be backported. So, changes should not be backported. So, but but there is some level of grooming but but there is some level of grooming but but there is some level of grooming every so often or at least I've heard every so often or at least I've heard every so often or at least I've heard that there's some level of grooming of that there's some level of grooming of that there's some level of grooming of of data that was bad or would violate of data that was bad or would violate of data that was bad or would violate it. Um I I'm really glad you asked this it. Um I I'm really glad you asked this it. Um I I'm really glad you asked this cuz this is this was my experience also cuz this is this was my experience also cuz this is this was my experience also joining of like how does this actually joining of like how does this actually joining of like how does this actually work and it does like seem like things work and it does like seem like things work and it does like seem like things change. While the rules may not have change. While the rules may not have change. While the rules may not have changed in the last 5 years and maybe changed in the last 5 years and maybe changed in the last 5 years and maybe some of the nuances did, um, you know, some of the nuances did, um, you know, some of the nuances did, um, you know, it's almost like being like a principal it's almost like being like a principal it's almost like being like a principal of an elementary school and you're of an elementary school and you're of an elementary school and you're saying everybody wear the same outfit saying everybody wear the same outfit saying everybody wear the same outfit one day and it's got to be this shade of one day and it's got to be this shade of one day and it's got to be this shade of blue shirt and jeans or whatever. Like blue shirt and jeans or whatever. Like blue shirt and jeans or whatever. Like there is a lot of gray area and no one there is a lot of gray area and no one there is a lot of gray area and no one has to be here and participate, right? has to be here and participate, right? has to be here and participate, right? There's a level of industry expectation, There's a level of industry expectation, There's a level of industry expectation, especially, you know, the more especially, you know, the more especially, you know, the more sophisticated you are. But getting sophisticated you are. But getting sophisticated you are. But getting everybody to agree, as I'm sure the everybody to agree, as I'm sure the everybody to agree, as I'm sure the Discord chat, I can't wait to go back Discord chat, I can't wait to go back Discord chat, I can't wait to go back and read it. uh getting everybody to and read it. uh getting everybody to and read it. uh getting everybody to agree even on the the same words in the agree even on the the same words in the agree even on the the same words in the same sentence for something simple is same sentence for something simple is same sentence for something simple is really really hard at a global scale. So really really hard at a global scale. So really really hard at a global scale. So um from my experience on the QWG which um from my experience on the QWG which um from my experience on the QWG which is a quality working group they've is a quality working group they've is a quality working group they've talked about tightening those fields and talked about tightening those fields and talked about tightening those fields and introducing new ones that are a lot more introducing new ones that are a lot more introducing new ones that are a lot more specific but it's one of those things specific but it's one of those things specific but it's one of those things that we have to balance with not boxing that we have to balance with not boxing that we have to balance with not boxing out people who may only it's still out people who may only it's still out people who may only it's still better to get something even if it's not better to get something even if it's not better to get something even if it's not totally wellformed than nothing at all totally wellformed than nothing at all totally wellformed than nothing at all and that's a tipping point. Um, for the and that's a tipping point. Um, for the and that's a tipping point. Um, for the record format, the quality of working record format, the quality of working record format, the quality of working group has uh decided that they're not group has uh decided that they're not group has uh decided that they're not going to be making going to be making going to be making uh major version changes uh no more than uh major version changes uh no more than uh major version changes uh no more than every six months. Likely it'll be, you every six months. Likely it'll be, you every six months. Likely it'll be, you know, take longer than that. But hey, yeah, let's Art's kicking us out hey, yeah, let's Art's kicking us out hey, yeah, let's Art's kicking us out and you have to listen to art. Art wants and you have to listen to art. Art wants and you have to listen to art. Art wants everybody to get out, but we have a lot everybody to get out, but we have a lot everybody to get out, but we have a lot of questions in Discord. So, can we do of questions in Discord. So, can we do of questions in Discord. So, can we do some give give Discord some love? Who's some give give Discord some love? Who's some give give Discord some love? Who's going to read them? Yes. Uh, so one of going to read them? Yes. Uh, so one of going to read them? Yes. Uh, so one of the questions in the Discord was uh the questions in the Discord was uh the questions in the Discord was uh generally what kind of feedback do you generally what kind of feedback do you generally what kind of feedback do you get from new CNAs on the state of tools get from new CNAs on the state of tools get from new CNAs on the state of tools available for creating and managing available for creating and managing available for creating and managing their assigned CVEes? their assigned CVEes? their assigned CVEes? I'll I'll start on that one because I'm I'll I'll start on that one because I'm I'll I'll start on that one because I'm the new one. the new one. the new one. Um, I was surprised there were there's Um, I was surprised there were there's Um, I was surprised there were there's not a lot of tools. There's a ton of not a lot of tools. There's a ton of not a lot of tools. There's a ton of bespoke tools that everybody implements. bespoke tools that everybody implements. bespoke tools that everybody implements. And I think it's also partially because And I think it's also partially because And I think it's also partially because the the scope, right, that mission the the scope, right, that mission the the scope, right, that mission statement is fairly narrow, right, in statement is fairly narrow, right, in statement is fairly narrow, right, in what the the program actually should be. what the the program actually should be. what the the program actually should be. The applicability is huge, but most The applicability is huge, but most The applicability is huge, but most people are looking for a specific thing people are looking for a specific thing people are looking for a specific thing in a specific way. And um you know, in a specific way. And um you know, in a specific way. And um you know, there's a REST API for CNAs to hit and there's a REST API for CNAs to hit and there's a REST API for CNAs to hit and do things. So you're either using a a do things. So you're either using a a do things. So you're either using a a front-end tool to do it or you're using front-end tool to do it or you're using front-end tool to do it or you're using the API with scripts. That's been our the API with scripts. That's been our the API with scripts. That's been our experience so far, but again, we're experience so far, but again, we're experience so far, but again, we're still young on the still young on the still young on the journey.
