Tommo. conversation. Tommo. conversation. Tommo. Thank you so much, Reena. Uh I'm Thank you so much, Reena. Uh I'm Thank you so much, Reena. Uh I'm Tommoito from JP Coordination Center. Tommoito from JP Coordination Center. Tommoito from JP Coordination Center. uh JP CC we are CVD coordinator and uh JP CC we are CVD coordinator and uh JP CC we are CVD coordinator and that's why I've been you know speaking that's why I've been you know speaking that's why I've been you know speaking about like this kind of stuff and my about like this kind of stuff and my about like this kind of stuff and my focus is on CBD CVE sbomb things like focus is on CBD CVE sbomb things like focus is on CBD CVE sbomb things like that everything CVD related and uh yeah that everything CVD related and uh yeah that everything CVD related and uh yeah that's pretty much it for me and Reena that's pretty much it for me and Reena that's pretty much it for me and Reena please please please so my name is Reena Rkipi I work for so my name is Reena Rkipi I work for so my name is Reena Rkipi I work for SIZA which is a cyber security and SIZA which is a cyber security and SIZA which is a cyber security and infrastructure security agency I lead infrastructure security agency I lead infrastructure security agency I lead our strategic partnerships and our strategic partnerships and our strategic partnerships and vulnerability program develop velment. vulnerability program develop velment. vulnerability program develop velment. So I kind of cover a wide range of So I kind of cover a wide range of So I kind of cover a wide range of things and uh what made me interested in things and uh what made me interested in things and uh what made me interested in these topics? I actually came from the these topics? I actually came from the these topics? I actually came from the writing side of the house at SIZA. I was writing side of the house at SIZA. I was writing side of the house at SIZA. I was charged with writing a lot of our joint charged with writing a lot of our joint charged with writing a lot of our joint cyber advisories and um I ended up cyber advisories and um I ended up cyber advisories and um I ended up publishing a series of publications publishing a series of publications publishing a series of publications entitled the secure by design alerts and entitled the secure by design alerts and entitled the secure by design alerts and they focused on eliminating classes of they focused on eliminating classes of they focused on eliminating classes of vulnerability. So, I'm very passionate vulnerability. So, I'm very passionate vulnerability. So, I'm very passionate about that topic and that kind of about that topic and that kind of about that topic and that kind of brought me over to the vulnerability brought me over to the vulnerability brought me over to the vulnerability management side of the house. Uh, where management side of the house. Uh, where management side of the house. Uh, where I help support our efforts in recruiting I help support our efforts in recruiting I help support our efforts in recruiting CNAs and upskilling CNAs. Uh, I focus on CNAs and upskilling CNAs. Uh, I focus on CNAs and upskilling CNAs. Uh, I focus on helping to make improvements with the helping to make improvements with the helping to make improvements with the CVE program and then also involved with CVE program and then also involved with CVE program and then also involved with Tommo in our global CVD community of Tommo in our global CVD community of Tommo in our global CVD community of practice where we're trying to uh gain practice where we're trying to uh gain practice where we're trying to uh gain common ground on on challenges with CVD common ground on on challenges with CVD common ground on on challenges with CVD and uh what are the best ways to do and uh what are the best ways to do and uh what are the best ways to do CVD. So that's a little bit about why CVD. So that's a little bit about why CVD. So that's a little bit about why we're here, who we are, why we care. And we're here, who we are, why we care. And we're here, who we are, why we care. And so I'd like to actually start with so I'd like to actually start with so I'd like to actually start with asking the audience a few questions. Who asking the audience a few questions. Who asking the audience a few questions. Who in here does or has done coordinated in here does or has done coordinated in here does or has done coordinated vulnerability disclosure? Raise your vulnerability disclosure? Raise your vulnerability disclosure? Raise your hand. That's nearly everyone. Okay, hand. That's nearly everyone. Okay, hand. That's nearly everyone. Okay, let's see. Length. Who here thinks let's see. Length. Who here thinks let's see. Length. Who here thinks they've done CVD for the they've done CVD for the they've done CVD for the longest? I'm looking at Pete. 2001. So, we've got around 24 2001. So, we've got around 24 2001. So, we've got around 24 years. Anyone at the 20-y year mark? years. Anyone at the 20-y year mark? years. Anyone at the 20-y year mark? Anyone else at the 20-year mark? Got Anyone else at the 20-year mark? Got Anyone else at the 20-year mark? Got someone in the someone in the someone in the back. 1989. So, he's got Pete and Omar back. 1989. So, he's got Pete and Omar back. 1989. So, he's got Pete and Omar beat. Okay. You're a young guy. Okay. You're a young guy. Okay. You're a young guy. Perfect. All Perfect. All Perfect. All right. Do we have anybody that's done right. Do we have anybody that's done right. Do we have anybody that's done CVD for 15 CVD for 15 CVD for 15 years? years? years? 10. Okay, we've got you over there. 10. Okay, we've got you over there. 10. Okay, we've got you over there. Um Dave over here 10 around 10 years. Um Dave over here 10 around 10 years. Um Dave over here 10 around 10 years. Okay, anyone five Okay, anyone five Okay, anyone five years? All right, we've got Maggie up years? All right, we've got Maggie up years? All right, we've got Maggie up front. Five years. Sweet. Anyone less front. Five years. Sweet. Anyone less front. Five years. Sweet. Anyone less than five than five than five years? years? years? Julia, less than five years. What's your Julia, less than five years. What's your Julia, less than five years. What's your name, name, name, sir? Caleb. Awesome. Um, are you doing sir? Caleb. Awesome. Um, are you doing sir? Caleb. Awesome. Um, are you doing CVD as a part of an organization, as a CVD as a part of an organization, as a CVD as a part of an organization, as a part of a part of a part of a government? Student. Awesome. We're so government? Student. Awesome. We're so government? Student. Awesome. We're so glad that you're here. Okay, next glad that you're here. Okay, next glad that you're here. Okay, next question. We're just trying to question. We're just trying to question. We're just trying to understand who who we've got here in the understand who who we've got here in the understand who who we've got here in the audience. Uh, anyone here a CVE audience. Uh, anyone here a CVE audience. Uh, anyone here a CVE numbering numbering numbering authority? A lot of you guys. Wow, we've authority? A lot of you guys. Wow, we've authority? A lot of you guys. Wow, we've got a great crew here. Okay, a lot of got a great crew here. Okay, a lot of got a great crew here. Okay, a lot of CVE numbering authorities. Anyone not a CVE numbering authorities. Anyone not a CVE numbering authorities. Anyone not a CVE numbering authority? that's CVE numbering authority? that's CVE numbering authority? that's interested in becoming a CVE numbering authority. I agree with Julia. So Julia authority. I agree with Julia. So Julia authority. I agree with Julia. So Julia Turkovich over there is our lead CNA Turkovich over there is our lead CNA Turkovich over there is our lead CNA recruiter at SIZA. Uh she's the great recruiter at SIZA. Uh she's the great recruiter at SIZA. Uh she's the great person to talk to and I think through person to talk to and I think through person to talk to and I think through this discussion today, we'll kind of this discussion today, we'll kind of this discussion today, we'll kind of uncover any challenges entities might uncover any challenges entities might uncover any challenges entities might have if they're not yet a CNA but are have if they're not yet a CNA but are have if they're not yet a CNA but are interested in becoming a CNA. Okay. And interested in becoming a CNA. Okay. And interested in becoming a CNA. Okay. And then uh who here uses CVE data? then uh who here uses CVE data? then uh who here uses CVE data? That should nearly be everybody. Okay, That should nearly be everybody. Okay, That should nearly be everybody. Okay, amazing. Who loves using CVE data? And then lastly, who here is data? And then lastly, who here is data? And then lastly, who here is excited to have an open discussion about excited to have an open discussion about excited to have an open discussion about challenges with CBD, CNA, and using CVE challenges with CBD, CNA, and using CVE challenges with CBD, CNA, and using CVE data? I'm raising both in my hands. data? I'm raising both in my hands. data? I'm raising both in my hands. Perfect. Okay. Uh I think we're going to Perfect. Okay. Uh I think we're going to Perfect. Okay. Uh I think we're going to kick it off with a bit of a problem kick it off with a bit of a problem kick it off with a bit of a problem statement. So, as I mentioned, Tommo and statement. So, as I mentioned, Tommo and statement. So, as I mentioned, Tommo and I are a part of our global uh community I are a part of our global uh community I are a part of our global uh community of practice on coordinated vulnerability of practice on coordinated vulnerability of practice on coordinated vulnerability disclosure. And the if you heard him and disclosure. And the if you heard him and disclosure. And the if you heard him and Justin Murphy talking about that Justin Murphy talking about that Justin Murphy talking about that yesterday, it's really meant to convene yesterday, it's really meant to convene yesterday, it's really meant to convene a bunch of international partners who do a bunch of international partners who do a bunch of international partners who do coordinated vulnerability disclosure and coordinated vulnerability disclosure and coordinated vulnerability disclosure and just gain some common ground like, hey, just gain some common ground like, hey, just gain some common ground like, hey, what challenges are we facing? How can what challenges are we facing? How can what challenges are we facing? How can we support one another? Uh so Tommo is we support one another? Uh so Tommo is we support one another? Uh so Tommo is going to dive going to dive going to dive into some of the problems that we've into some of the problems that we've into some of the problems that we've uncovered through that community of uncovered through that community of uncovered through that community of practice along with the problem practice along with the problem practice along with the problem statement and then we're going to just statement and then we're going to just statement and then we're going to just start asking some questions and opening start asking some questions and opening start asking some questions and opening the floor to discussion. Tommo. the floor to discussion. Tommo. the floor to discussion. Tommo. Thank you. So the problem that I would Thank you. So the problem that I would Thank you. So the problem that I would like to bring up is that we also as like to bring up is that we also as like to bring up is that we also as Reena Reena Reena said CISA and a person from SISA and said CISA and a person from SISA and said CISA and a person from SISA and myself have been leading this uh myself have been leading this uh myself have been leading this uh community of practice of CBD and there community of practice of CBD and there community of practice of CBD and there are different members participating uh are different members participating uh are different members participating uh from different parts of the world and we from different parts of the world and we from different parts of the world and we have been introducing ourselves in at have been introducing ourselves in at have been introducing ourselves in at the meeting and we're talking about CBD the meeting and we're talking about CBD the meeting and we're talking about CBD but one thing I've realized is that when but one thing I've realized is that when but one thing I've realized is that when we are speaking about like CBD different we are speaking about like CBD different we are speaking about like CBD different members have different image or focus members have different image or focus members have different image or focus area or focus uh phase of CVD so that area or focus uh phase of CVD so that area or focus uh phase of CVD so that actually CVD for different members are actually CVD for different members are actually CVD for different members are different so that's a big problem that I different so that's a big problem that I different so that's a big problem that I see because uh in CVD the one of the see because uh in CVD the one of the see because uh in CVD the one of the most important things is that most important things is that most important things is that information is reached to the people who information is reached to the people who information is reached to the people who need to know and the information must be need to know and the information must be need to know and the information must be uh quality uh quality uh quality information and and since we have a information and and since we have a information and and since we have a different image of CBD and we're speak different image of CBD and we're speak different image of CBD and we're speak we are actually speaking about different we are actually speaking about different we are actually speaking about different things uh you know different image of things uh you know different image of things uh you know different image of CBD creates this different layers in CBD CBD creates this different layers in CBD CBD creates this different layers in CBD and separation so that part needs to be and separation so that part needs to be and separation so that part needs to be harmonized is harmonized is harmonized is my that challenge that I found through my that challenge that I found through my that challenge that I found through the activity of CBD COP so I'm trying to the activity of CBD COP so I'm trying to the activity of CBD COP so I'm trying to solve that and I'm trying to find a solve that and I'm trying to find a solve that and I'm trying to find a reason for that and uh could cultural reason for that and uh could cultural reason for that and uh could cultural differences, maybe language barriers, differences, maybe language barriers, differences, maybe language barriers, maybe because of your uh the mission of maybe because of your uh the mission of maybe because of your uh the mission of the your organization that you have uh the your organization that you have uh the your organization that you have uh that creates those differences. So yeah, that creates those differences. So yeah, that creates those differences. So yeah, and I would like to hear your and I would like to hear your and I would like to hear your experiences regarding CBD, what problems experiences regarding CBD, what problems experiences regarding CBD, what problems you had, what problems you have faced. you had, what problems you have faced. you had, what problems you have faced. So if you could speak up, that would be So if you could speak up, that would be So if you could speak up, that would be very appreciated. And the first question very appreciated. And the first question very appreciated. And the first question I would like to ask is the do you have I would like to ask is the do you have I would like to ask is the do you have does anyone have does anyone have does anyone have u experience of you know uh CBD case u experience of you know uh CBD case u experience of you know uh CBD case failing because of uh communication went failing because of uh communication went failing because of uh communication went wrong with the stakeholders or you had wrong with the stakeholders or you had wrong with the stakeholders or you had different image of CBD with the different image of CBD with the different image of CBD with the stakeholders that things went wrong and stakeholders that things went wrong and stakeholders that things went wrong and information could not dis be disclosed information could not dis be disclosed information could not dis be disclosed things like that like has anyone things like that like has anyone things like that like has anyone experienced that like in CBD and if you experienced that like in CBD and if you experienced that like in CBD and if you have Oh, please share it. There we go. You're not. Now it's on. Uh, so different Now it's on. Uh, so different Now it's on. Uh, so different perspective than most of you CNAs. I perspective than most of you CNAs. I perspective than most of you CNAs. I work at Verizon, so we are not um that work at Verizon, so we are not um that work at Verizon, so we are not um that and and and um ours is the other way around, right? um ours is the other way around, right? um ours is the other way around, right? We have products. We are obviously a We have products. We are obviously a We have products. We are obviously a very large telecommunication network and very large telecommunication network and very large telecommunication network and people report vulnerabilities to us. people report vulnerabilities to us. people report vulnerabilities to us. It's one of the multiple ways we find It's one of the multiple ways we find It's one of the multiple ways we find vulnerabilities. I run the proactive vulnerabilities. I run the proactive vulnerabilities. I run the proactive security team. So, exposure and security team. So, exposure and security team. So, exposure and vulnerability management, pentest red vulnerability management, pentest red vulnerability management, pentest red team, AI red team, all that fun stuff. team, AI red team, all that fun stuff. team, AI red team, all that fun stuff. Um, and we don't participate in any Um, and we don't participate in any Um, and we don't participate in any public bug bounty either. So when public bug bounty either. So when public bug bounty either. So when someone finds something which actually someone finds something which actually someone finds something which actually just happened about a week or two ago um just happened about a week or two ago um just happened about a week or two ago um they Google you know how to report a they Google you know how to report a they Google you know how to report a vulnerability and that gets routed to vulnerability and that gets routed to vulnerability and that gets routed to us. We obviously look make sure it's not us. We obviously look make sure it's not us. We obviously look make sure it's not an incident make sure it's actually a an incident make sure it's actually a an incident make sure it's actually a researcher we do all the threat intel on researcher we do all the threat intel on researcher we do all the threat intel on that person etc. If they absolutely want that person etc. If they absolutely want that person etc. If they absolutely want to get paid we have a process for that to get paid we have a process for that to get paid we have a process for that but it's very ad hoc. Um, but that's but it's very ad hoc. Um, but that's but it's very ad hoc. Um, but that's really the the bigger issue we had was really the the bigger issue we had was really the the bigger issue we had was before we had a process to pay someone, before we had a process to pay someone, before we had a process to pay someone, a researcher would say, "Hey, we found a researcher would say, "Hey, we found a researcher would say, "Hey, we found something." And Verizon being Verizon something." And Verizon being Verizon something." And Verizon being Verizon sometimes like Verizon.net, people think sometimes like Verizon.net, people think sometimes like Verizon.net, people think that's Verizon, that's actually our that's Verizon, that's actually our that's Verizon, that's actually our customers. customers. customers. Um, they won't give us details, right? Um, they won't give us details, right? Um, they won't give us details, right? So then we had to build this process So then we had to build this process So then we had to build this process with a third party that hey, if you want with a third party that hey, if you want with a third party that hey, if you want to get paid, then you got to sign up to get paid, then you got to sign up to get paid, then you got to sign up with this third party. You got to fill with this third party. You got to fill with this third party. You got to fill out information. We need to know who you out information. We need to know who you out information. We need to know who you actually are cuz if you want to get actually are cuz if you want to get actually are cuz if you want to get paid, we can't just like, you know, paid, we can't just like, you know, paid, we can't just like, you know, Bitcoin you, right? We don't want a an Bitcoin you, right? We don't want a an Bitcoin you, right? We don't want a an Uber uh problem uh that occurred there a Uber uh problem uh that occurred there a Uber uh problem uh that occurred there a few years ago. So, um, so I think that few years ago. So, um, so I think that few years ago. So, um, so I think that was the biggest challenge was figuring was the biggest challenge was figuring was the biggest challenge was figuring out how to pay someone when they out how to pay someone when they out how to pay someone when they absolutely want it, right? Because when absolutely want it, right? Because when absolutely want it, right? Because when we talk coordinated vulnerability we talk coordinated vulnerability we talk coordinated vulnerability disclosure, obviously it's nice to not disclosure, obviously it's nice to not disclosure, obviously it's nice to not have to pay them, but they also did have to pay them, but they also did have to pay them, but they also did work. So, you know, no free bugs. So, work. So, you know, no free bugs. So, work. So, you know, no free bugs. So, that's that that was our challenge, our that's that that was our challenge, our that's that that was our challenge, our most recent challenge. No, that's a most recent challenge. No, that's a most recent challenge. No, that's a great point. And I think um brings up great point. And I think um brings up great point. And I think um brings up another great question um from the another great question um from the another great question um from the private organization perspective. Uh, private organization perspective. Uh, private organization perspective. Uh, has anyone built a bug bounty program in has anyone built a bug bounty program in has anyone built a bug bounty program in this room or do people prefer to use a this room or do people prefer to use a this room or do people prefer to use a third third third party? Omar, we might have to pass around the Omar, we might have to pass around the Omar, we might have to pass around the mic. Probably a little bit better. Yeah, mic. Probably a little bit better. Yeah, mic. Probably a little bit better. Yeah, we have a multiple bug bounty programs. we have a multiple bug bounty programs. we have a multiple bug bounty programs. We grow through acquisitions. You know, We grow through acquisitions. You know, We grow through acquisitions. You know, Cisco um has inherited some bug bounty Cisco um has inherited some bug bounty Cisco um has inherited some bug bounty programs, have created bug bug bug programs, have created bug bug bug programs, have created bug bug bug bounty programs. And you probably can bounty programs. And you probably can bounty programs. And you probably can throw a shirt to me because I was the throw a shirt to me because I was the throw a shirt to me because I was the one that created the bug bounty policy one that created the bug bounty policy one that created the bug bounty policy at Cisco that they hated because we at Cisco that they hated because we at Cisco that they hated because we needed to harmonize a lot of things. It needed to harmonize a lot of things. It needed to harmonize a lot of things. It was all over the place. So I or was all over the place. So I or was all over the place. So I or basically what you were mentioning about basically what you were mentioning about basically what you were mentioning about um random reports that don't know don't um random reports that don't know don't um random reports that don't know don't know how to report vulnerabilities. know how to report vulnerabilities. know how to report vulnerabilities. Hopefully we need to we need to address Hopefully we need to we need to address Hopefully we need to we need to address that by incorporating standards already that by incorporating standards already that by incorporating standards already in assist like security.ext text, you in assist like security.ext text, you in assist like security.ext text, you know, or through DNS, like if people know, or through DNS, like if people know, or through DNS, like if people actually know where to report the actually know where to report the actually know where to report the vulnerabilities and we have the vulnerabilities and we have the vulnerabilities and we have the vulnerability policy, um, you know, vulnerability policy, um, you know, vulnerability policy, um, you know, exposed to that. Now, a lot of the bug exposed to that. Now, a lot of the bug exposed to that. Now, a lot of the bug bounty platforms and a lot of the, you bounty platforms and a lot of the, you bounty platforms and a lot of the, you know, more mature security researching know, more mature security researching know, more mature security researching firms, they actually already know that firms, they actually already know that firms, they actually already know that and they're using that information to and they're using that information to and they're using that information to actually find out, hey, this is the way actually find out, hey, this is the way actually find out, hey, this is the way that you contact a PER team or, you that you contact a PER team or, you that you contact a PER team or, you know, the vendor, etc. So, if you're not know, the vendor, etc. So, if you're not know, the vendor, etc. So, if you're not familiar with the security.ext text or familiar with the security.ext text or familiar with the security.ext text or even you can do this with DNS uh even you can do this with DNS uh even you can do this with DNS uh records. I I will definitely encourage records. I I will definitely encourage records. I I will definitely encourage you but going back to the bug bounties. you but going back to the bug bounties. you but going back to the bug bounties. Yeah, I can go on for Yeah, I can go on for Yeah, I can go on for hours from private public even some hours from private public even some hours from private public even some nomenclatures called clear where some nomenclatures called clear where some nomenclatures called clear where some bug mount programs actually even bug mount programs actually even bug mount programs actually even do background checks onto the people do background checks onto the people do background checks onto the people that actually are supporting those. We that actually are supporting those. We that actually are supporting those. We have seen them all right. Are they have seen them all right. Are they have seen them all right. Are they successful all the time? No. Do they successful all the time? No. Do they successful all the time? No. Do they have challenges that can be addressed? have challenges that can be addressed? have challenges that can be addressed? Yes. Yes. Yes. Um, do we also use VDP that we don't Um, do we also use VDP that we don't Um, do we also use VDP that we don't give money? Absolutely. As a matter of give money? Absolutely. As a matter of give money? Absolutely. As a matter of fact, most of the reports that we get to fact, most of the reports that we get to fact, most of the reports that we get to Cisco not as a vendor but the enterprise Cisco not as a vendor but the enterprise Cisco not as a vendor but the enterprise like you know cisco.com etc. we actually like you know cisco.com etc. we actually like you know cisco.com etc. we actually route all that through a VDP program and route all that through a VDP program and route all that through a VDP program and that is external to the company. Yeah, that is external to the company. Yeah, that is external to the company. Yeah, that's a way to scale a little bit. that's a way to scale a little bit. that's a way to scale a little bit. Yeah. Anyone in the audience have any Yeah. Anyone in the audience have any Yeah. Anyone in the audience have any thoughts on what Omar said? thoughts on what Omar said? thoughts on what Omar said? Sir, just go back to I might walk around Sir, just go back to I might walk around Sir, just go back to I might walk around and pass around the mic. So, just going back to to George's uh So, just going back to to George's uh So, just going back to to George's uh initial thing and and what Omar added to initial thing and and what Omar added to initial thing and and what Omar added to it from a CNA perspective. I mean, it's it from a CNA perspective. I mean, it's it from a CNA perspective. I mean, it's 2025. Are bug bounties 2025. Are bug bounties 2025. Are bug bounties assumed? Because quite frankly, assumed? Because quite frankly, assumed? Because quite frankly, everywhere else it seems bug bounties everywhere else it seems bug bounties everywhere else it seems bug bounties are assumed. So like when you say are assumed. So like when you say are assumed. So like when you say Verizon doesn't have a bug bounty Verizon doesn't have a bug bounty Verizon doesn't have a bug bounty program, I mean it's it's program, I mean it's it's program, I mean it's it's 2025. So I mean is that is it reasonable 2025. So I mean is that is it reasonable 2025. So I mean is that is it reasonable to you know to expect that any kind of to you know to expect that any kind of to you know to expect that any kind of responsible reporter is going to come to responsible reporter is going to come to responsible reporter is going to come to you? No. So yeah, there's there's you? No. So yeah, there's there's you? No. So yeah, there's there's history with that. history with that. history with that. Okay, that was it. Oh, Pete's getting Okay, that was it. Oh, Pete's getting Okay, that was it. Oh, Pete's getting up. up. up. Watch Watch Watch out. And out. And out. And I I'm gonna take a middle road on that I I'm gonna take a middle road on that I I'm gonna take a middle road on that because I think that I think there's because I think that I think there's because I think that I think there's sort of different um there's different sort of different um there's different sort of different um there's different takes on this, right? Because I think takes on this, right? Because I think takes on this, right? Because I think that some companies also use a bug that some companies also use a bug that some companies also use a bug bounty program as too much of a bounty program as too much of a bounty program as too much of a catch-all that they say like, "Oh, we catch-all that they say like, "Oh, we catch-all that they say like, "Oh, we have a bug bounty program, so it'll have a bug bounty program, so it'll have a bug bounty program, so it'll catch anything that needs to get catch anything that needs to get catch anything that needs to get caught." And they use it as a bit of a caught." And they use it as a bit of a caught." And they use it as a bit of a replacement for really comprehensive replacement for really comprehensive replacement for really comprehensive internal testing. Um, and so I I think I internal testing. Um, and so I I think I internal testing. Um, and so I I think I can sort of see it a bit both ways. And can sort of see it a bit both ways. And can sort of see it a bit both ways. And I think having I think having I think having um like a good vulnerability disclosure um like a good vulnerability disclosure um like a good vulnerability disclosure program is very important, right, which program is very important, right, which program is very important, right, which Verizon has. Um, but I I think if a Verizon has. Um, but I I think if a Verizon has. Um, but I I think if a company is taking the position company is taking the position company is taking the position of we do extremely comprehensive of we do extremely comprehensive of we do extremely comprehensive internal testing, we have avenues for internal testing, we have avenues for internal testing, we have avenues for you to report things, we're just not you to report things, we're just not you to report things, we're just not necessarily going to incentivize it necessarily going to incentivize it necessarily going to incentivize it financially. financially. financially. I I think that that's sort of up to the I I think that that's sort of up to the I I think that that's sort of up to the company to make that call to your question. So Verizon did have a to your question. So Verizon did have a to your question. So Verizon did have a bug bounty program before. I've only bug bounty program before. I've only bug bounty program before. I've only been there for two years. Prior to that, been there for two years. Prior to that, been there for two years. Prior to that, they went I believe it was with Hacker they went I believe it was with Hacker they went I believe it was with Hacker One and they spent like $2.5 million in One and they spent like $2.5 million in One and they spent like $2.5 million in one month because they didn't do one month because they didn't do one month because they didn't do appropriate testing before going to the appropriate testing before going to the appropriate testing before going to the bug bounty. Right? So, we've built a bug bounty. Right? So, we've built a bug bounty. Right? So, we've built a maturity model right now where you we do maturity model right now where you we do maturity model right now where you we do authenticated pentesting against authenticated pentesting against authenticated pentesting against non-production through our team or a non-production through our team or a non-production through our team or a third party first, then it gets added. third party first, then it gets added. third party first, then it gets added. We're using a company called Inspective. We're using a company called Inspective. We're using a company called Inspective. They've been pretty cool because they're They've been pretty cool because they're They've been pretty cool because they're allowing us to do this. So, then they do allowing us to do this. So, then they do allowing us to do this. So, then they do pentest as a service from a production pentest as a service from a production pentest as a service from a production blackbox perspective. Then they have blackbox perspective. Then they have blackbox perspective. Then they have private bug bounty. So any app that has private bug bounty. So any app that has private bug bounty. So any app that has gone through those two is currently in gone through those two is currently in gone through those two is currently in private bug bounty and then we private bug bounty and then we private bug bounty and then we eventually will get to public bug bounty eventually will get to public bug bounty eventually will get to public bug bounty but I don't want to do public bug bounty but I don't want to do public bug bounty but I don't want to do public bug bounty on any app that hasn't gone through the on any app that hasn't gone through the on any app that hasn't gone through the pre the previous three because then pre the previous three because then pre the previous three because then that's how you spend $2 million in a that's how you spend $2 million in a that's how you spend $2 million in a month. Um so that's that's the track month. Um so that's that's the track month. Um so that's that's the track we're going there. I totally agree and we're going there. I totally agree and we're going there. I totally agree and definitely pro that I worked at SIG definitely pro that I worked at SIG definitely pro that I worked at SIG group for 10 years. We have we built the group for 10 years. We have we built the group for 10 years. We have we built the public bug bounty there. Uh I definitely public bug bounty there. Uh I definitely public bug bounty there. Uh I definitely agree. I mean, researchers should get agree. I mean, researchers should get agree. I mean, researchers should get paid. Like, if you spent time finding paid. Like, if you spent time finding paid. Like, if you spent time finding this vulnerability, you should get this vulnerability, you should get this vulnerability, you should get compensated for your time and not just a compensated for your time and not just a compensated for your time and not just a t-shirt that says Verizon. Hi, Pete Aller. Verizon. Hi, Pete Aller. Verizon. Hi, Pete Aller. Um, why am I paying for SDLC? That's really the question you have to That's really the question you have to That's really the question you have to ask yourself. Any thoughts in the crowd? ask yourself. Any thoughts in the crowd? ask yourself. Any thoughts in the crowd? Oh, that that's a statement, not a Oh, that that's a statement, not a Oh, that that's a statement, not a that's a rhetorical question. So, um, that's a rhetorical question. So, um, that's a rhetorical question. So, um, most who use a Bug Bunny who have most who use a Bug Bunny who have most who use a Bug Bunny who have thought through it are actually paying thought through it are actually paying thought through it are actually paying for you to do their pen testing on their for you to do their pen testing on their for you to do their pen testing on their specific areas they want you to focus specific areas they want you to focus specific areas they want you to focus on. They're also taking you away from on. They're also taking you away from on. They're also taking you away from where they don't want you to where they don't want you to where they don't want you to look. Wow. And I don't see bug bounty look. Wow. And I don't see bug bounty look. Wow. And I don't see bug bounty programs as quote a deacto standard. programs as quote a deacto standard. programs as quote a deacto standard. US government used it and what did they US government used it and what did they US government used it and what did they do? They were focusing on web do? They were focusing on web do? They were focusing on web applications. That's a consumer enduser applications. That's a consumer enduser applications. That's a consumer enduser problem set, right? Not a problem set, right? Not a problem set, right? Not a vendor. So, everyone should be doing vendor. So, everyone should be doing vendor. So, everyone should be doing SDLC. But I look at like SDLC. But I look at like SDLC. But I look at like this. Isn't that information this. Isn't that information this. Isn't that information open? Especially you're looking at open open? Especially you're looking at open open? Especially you're looking at open source supposed to be open and source supposed to be open and source supposed to be open and transparent. So why are you hiding it? transparent. So why are you hiding it? transparent. So why are you hiding it? Why aren't you taking it to the Why aren't you taking it to the Why aren't you taking it to the community to community to community to address? address? address? Otherwise, you know, are you just a Otherwise, you know, are you just a Otherwise, you know, are you just a hacker for hacker for hacker for hire? Now, I get that might be your way hire? Now, I get that might be your way hire? Now, I get that might be your way of making money, but the reality is as a of making money, but the reality is as a of making money, but the reality is as a systemic systemic systemic process. We're about raising everyone's process. We're about raising everyone's process. We're about raising everyone's boat. So, we have an interchange. And if boat. So, we have an interchange. And if boat. So, we have an interchange. And if you look at most of us who have been you look at most of us who have been you look at most of us who have been around in the industry for a while, we around in the industry for a while, we around in the industry for a while, we exchange data almost daily about problem exchange data almost daily about problem exchange data almost daily about problem sets to do that. There's no hacker sets to do that. There's no hacker sets to do that. There's no hacker bounty on that. There's no bug bounty on bounty on that. There's no bug bounty on bounty on that. There's no bug bounty on that. It's, hey, Omar, I have a problem. that. It's, hey, Omar, I have a problem. that. It's, hey, Omar, I have a problem. I think it affects I think it affects I think it affects you, you know, and that's reciprocal. So you, you know, and that's reciprocal. So you, you know, and that's reciprocal. So the question really is is what's the the question really is is what's the the question really is is what's the focus of of a bug bunny? because it's focus of of a bug bunny? because it's focus of of a bug bunny? because it's not really not really not really CBD. You're paying for SDLC CBD. You're paying for SDLC CBD. You're paying for SDLC pentesting. And and if you realize pentesting. And and if you realize pentesting. And and if you realize that's what you're looking at, then the that's what you're looking at, then the that's what you're looking at, then the question is, do you need help with your question is, do you need help with your question is, do you need help with your pen testing? And then do you regularize pen testing? And then do you regularize pen testing? And then do you regularize that? And to to say it's a bug bounty that? And to to say it's a bug bounty that? And to to say it's a bug bounty because it's a CVE, I think is a because it's a CVE, I think is a because it's a CVE, I think is a misnomer. I agree with parts of that. I agree with parts of that. I agree with parts of that. Um I think having having run a few bug Um I think having having run a few bug Um I think having having run a few bug bounty programs before, I think it's a bounty programs before, I think it's a bounty programs before, I think it's a few things, right? Um I I can't speak few things, right? Um I I can't speak few things, right? Um I I can't speak for other companies, but I think that for other companies, but I think that for other companies, but I think that things that we have put out of scope things that we have put out of scope things that we have put out of scope were less were less were less because there was a boogeyman there that because there was a boogeyman there that because there was a boogeyman there that we didn't want people to like let out of we didn't want people to like let out of we didn't want people to like let out of the box and more because we they're the box and more because we they're the box and more because we they're expensive. I mean, Hacker One, Bug expensive. I mean, Hacker One, Bug expensive. I mean, Hacker One, Bug Crowd, whoever you use, it's it's not Crowd, whoever you use, it's it's not Crowd, whoever you use, it's it's not cheap. Um, and so we put a lot of cheap. Um, and so we put a lot of cheap. Um, and so we put a lot of thought into prioritizing, you know, if thought into prioritizing, you know, if thought into prioritizing, you know, if we're going to spend this money, where we're going to spend this money, where we're going to spend this money, where do we really want to get the most bang do we really want to get the most bang do we really want to get the most bang for our buck? And as far as the why, for our buck? And as far as the why, for our buck? And as far as the why, um, if you are a mature organization, um, if you are a mature organization, um, if you are a mature organization, which I think is super important that which I think is super important that which I think is super important that you need to be a mature organization you need to be a mature organization you need to be a mature organization before you do this for lots of reasons, before you do this for lots of reasons, before you do this for lots of reasons, but if you typically are an organization but if you typically are an organization but if you typically are an organization that uses a decentralized model, might that uses a decentralized model, might that uses a decentralized model, might have one or two pentesters on a line of have one or two pentesters on a line of have one or two pentesters on a line of business, business unit, set of business, business unit, set of business, business unit, set of products, and those pentesters are products, and those pentesters are products, and those pentesters are really good. They tend to stick around really good. They tend to stick around really good. They tend to stick around for a while. Um, and so they're at least for a while. Um, and so they're at least for a while. Um, and so they're at least from from my perspective, what I have from from my perspective, what I have from from my perspective, what I have seen is that those pen testers get very seen is that those pen testers get very seen is that those pen testers get very very familiar with a product, they very familiar with a product, they very familiar with a product, they return great results, but you don't have return great results, but you don't have return great results, but you don't have the level of thought diversity the level of thought diversity the level of thought diversity um that maybe a fresh set of eyes could um that maybe a fresh set of eyes could um that maybe a fresh set of eyes could give you on that product. And so where give you on that product. And so where give you on that product. And so where we've seen value for bug bounty programs we've seen value for bug bounty programs we've seen value for bug bounty programs is saying, you know, hey, our pen is saying, you know, hey, our pen is saying, you know, hey, our pen testers have done the assessment on this testers have done the assessment on this testers have done the assessment on this product. They they might have done it a product. They they might have done it a product. They they might have done it a few times through a few different few times through a few different few times through a few different releases, but this is a really high releases, but this is a really high releases, but this is a really high priority product for us, right? I worked priority product for us, right? I worked priority product for us, right? I worked at Rockwell Automation, so our stuff at Rockwell Automation, so our stuff at Rockwell Automation, so our stuff kind of ran a bunch of really important kind of ran a bunch of really important kind of ran a bunch of really important things. And so, um, we would look at things. And so, um, we would look at things. And so, um, we would look at what offers do we think are really what offers do we think are really what offers do we think are really critical to make sure that we get some critical to make sure that we get some critical to make sure that we get some thought diversity from pentesting on and thought diversity from pentesting on and thought diversity from pentesting on and we would do those as sort of a limited we would do those as sort of a limited we would do those as sort of a limited scope and say, "Hey, like we just really scope and say, "Hey, like we just really scope and say, "Hey, like we just really want a few really good researchers who want a few really good researchers who want a few really good researchers who have very high level expertise in these have very high level expertise in these have very high level expertise in these kinds of applications, platforms, kinds of applications, platforms, kinds of applications, platforms, products, etc. products, etc. products, etc. to take a few months and just hammer it, to take a few months and just hammer it, to take a few months and just hammer it, right? And, you know, do your worst. Get right? And, you know, do your worst. Get right? And, you know, do your worst. Get back to us. Tell us what you found. back to us. Tell us what you found. back to us. Tell us what you found. We're happy to compensate you for that We're happy to compensate you for that We're happy to compensate you for that time. And it it provides a lot of value time. And it it provides a lot of value time. And it it provides a lot of value because there's things because there's things because there's things that, you know, I think one of the that, you know, I think one of the that, you know, I think one of the things that we learn through things that we learn through things that we learn through organizations like this is that, you organizations like this is that, you organizations like this is that, you know, you solve a problem different than know, you solve a problem different than know, you solve a problem different than I do. You solve a problem different than I do. You solve a problem different than I do. You solve a problem different than I do. And so getting some rotation on I do. And so getting some rotation on I do. And so getting some rotation on the bench in who's pentesting your the bench in who's pentesting your the bench in who's pentesting your product can can really sort of be that product can can really sort of be that product can can really sort of be that next level up if you already have a next level up if you already have a next level up if you already have a mature program. It's essentially mature program. It's essentially mature program. It's essentially proactive security and depth. You do proactive security and depth. You do proactive security and depth. You do have your secure software development have your secure software development have your secure software development cycle. That's like minimum requirement. cycle. That's like minimum requirement. cycle. That's like minimum requirement. But even these apps that have gone But even these apps that have gone But even these apps that have gone through a full pentest, white box, then through a full pentest, white box, then through a full pentest, white box, then blackbox, etc., you put in private bug blackbox, etc., you put in private bug blackbox, etc., you put in private bug banning and they're still finding banning and they're still finding banning and they're still finding something. So it would be naive to think something. So it would be naive to think something. So it would be naive to think that your SSDLC is going to catch that your SSDLC is going to catch that your SSDLC is going to catch everything because it's not. You're, you everything because it's not. You're, you everything because it's not. You're, you know, you're doing source code review, know, you're doing source code review, know, you're doing source code review, you're doing DAS, you're doing this, you're doing DAS, you're doing this, you're doing DAS, you're doing this, you're doing that. But someone's going you're doing that. But someone's going you're doing that. But someone's going to get there and they're going to find to get there and they're going to find to get there and they're going to find something. And if you don't have that something. And if you don't have that something. And if you don't have that mechanism for them to report it to you, mechanism for them to report it to you, mechanism for them to report it to you, then they might just go public with it then they might just go public with it then they might just go public with it or sell it to a threat actor or do or sell it to a threat actor or do or sell it to a threat actor or do something else. So I think, you know, something else. So I think, you know, something else. So I think, you know, don't rely on it solely, right? I'm not don't rely on it solely, right? I'm not don't rely on it solely, right? I'm not saying, oh, only have bug bounty and saying, oh, only have bug bounty and saying, oh, only have bug bounty and don't do anything else or only have CVD don't do anything else or only have CVD don't do anything else or only have CVD and don't do anything else. I just think and don't do anything else. I just think and don't do anything else. I just think it's part of like our defense and depth. it's part of like our defense and depth. it's part of like our defense and depth. It's proactive security and depth. Yeah. Right. Perfect. Do you have another challenge Perfect. Do you have another challenge Perfect. Do you have another challenge that you're facing? Yeah. Um, so I've that you're facing? Yeah. Um, so I've that you're facing? Yeah. Um, so I've worked for two big industrial OEMs. You worked for two big industrial OEMs. You worked for two big industrial OEMs. You know, we sold products globally and I know, we sold products globally and I know, we sold products globally and I think a trend that we really struggled think a trend that we really struggled think a trend that we really struggled with was with was with was um being companies that large portions um being companies that large portions um being companies that large portions of our security team were focused in the of our security team were focused in the of our security team were focused in the US. We primarily worked with SIZA on US. We primarily worked with SIZA on US. We primarily worked with SIZA on doing CBD, right? You know, we were all doing CBD, right? You know, we were all doing CBD, right? You know, we were all we all had our Vince portal um and we all had our Vince portal um and we all had our Vince portal um and coordinated everything through that and coordinated everything through that and coordinated everything through that and we we got some feedback from folks we we got some feedback from folks we we got some feedback from folks internationally that were, you know, internationally that were, you know, internationally that were, you know, also very large customers of ours that also very large customers of ours that also very large customers of ours that they felt like there was some they felt like there was some they felt like there was some favoritism, some Americaentrism and some favoritism, some Americaentrism and some favoritism, some Americaentrism and some lag in them getting the data because lag in them getting the data because lag in them getting the data because they were waiting for the SIZA report to they were waiting for the SIZA report to they were waiting for the SIZA report to come out, right? So we would hear from come out, right? So we would hear from come out, right? So we would hear from them of you know why didn't you also them of you know why didn't you also them of you know why didn't you also coordinate this with Polandert Franceert coordinate this with Polandert Franceert coordinate this with Polandert Franceert BSI um you know there's a whole host of BSI um you know there's a whole host of BSI um you know there's a whole host of them um and now like with CRA there's them um and now like with CRA there's them um and now like with CRA there's there's a NISSA reporting and that is there's a NISSA reporting and that is there's a NISSA reporting and that is going to be coming down the pipeline in going to be coming down the pipeline in going to be coming down the pipeline in 2026 do you 2026 do you 2026 do you foresee functionality in a portal like foresee functionality in a portal like foresee functionality in a portal like this that there might be able to be this that there might be able to be this that there might be able to be like we're 72 hours from disclosure like we're 72 hours from disclosure like we're 72 hours from disclosure And maybe there is a functionality in And maybe there is a functionality in And maybe there is a functionality in vents that we can do like a radio button vents that we can do like a radio button vents that we can do like a radio button of others to give them a chance of others to give them a chance of others to give them a chance to translate it before it goes out the to translate it before it goes out the to translate it before it goes out the door and also to do coordination on it. door and also to do coordination on it. door and also to do coordination on it. Um please tell me that you're about to Um please tell me that you're about to Um please tell me that you're about to say yes and my dream will come true. So say yes and my dream will come true. So say yes and my dream will come true. So I won't be able to speak to that U I won't be able to speak to that U I won't be able to speak to that U Maggie but um I'm hearing that a Maggie but um I'm hearing that a Maggie but um I'm hearing that a challenge is again um informing challenge is again um informing challenge is again um informing international partners because if there international partners because if there international partners because if there I I believe there's a lot of I I believe there's a lot of I I believe there's a lot of organizations in this crowd who service organizations in this crowd who service organizations in this crowd who service international customers and so how do we international customers and so how do we international customers and so how do we get them the information they need to get them the information they need to get them the information they need to inform their customers or take action on inform their customers or take action on inform their customers or take action on their side? Okay. So as a vendor I won't their side? Okay. So as a vendor I won't their side? Okay. So as a vendor I won't disclose disclose disclose that. I'll tell you why. I've done that that. I'll tell you why. I've done that that. I'll tell you why. I've done that before in classified spaces to only have before in classified spaces to only have before in classified spaces to only have it come back from quote one of their it come back from quote one of their it come back from quote one of their partners that went to then a commercial partners that went to then a commercial partners that went to then a commercial that came back. This is a problem that that came back. This is a problem that that came back. This is a problem that the vendor community has had with SISA, the vendor community has had with SISA, the vendor community has had with SISA, its predecessor Nipy and everyone who's its predecessor Nipy and everyone who's its predecessor Nipy and everyone who's run through there with Carnegie Melon. run through there with Carnegie Melon. run through there with Carnegie Melon. So our trust level is So our trust level is So our trust level is zilch. That's a real problem set. Now in zilch. That's a real problem set. Now in zilch. That's a real problem set. Now in Vince, you can actually do that kind of Vince, you can actually do that kind of Vince, you can actually do that kind of notification, but you have a problem in notification, but you have a problem in notification, but you have a problem in that it's controlled by CISA. And when that it's controlled by CISA. And when that it's controlled by CISA. And when we've asked, we've had problems about we've asked, we've had problems about we've asked, we've had problems about that coming that coming that coming through. And we've had a running through. And we've had a running through. And we've had a running discussion with SISA about having access discussion with SISA about having access discussion with SISA about having access to Vince in the code. Now they've thrown to Vince in the code. Now they've thrown to Vince in the code. Now they've thrown it out. Uh but the problem that we're it out. Uh but the problem that we're it out. Uh but the problem that we're looking for from a community effort is looking for from a community effort is looking for from a community effort is how do we do that disclosure on a how do we do that disclosure on a how do we do that disclosure on a pointtooint instead of via the hub? If pointtooint instead of via the hub? If pointtooint instead of via the hub? If we could make Vince do that, then you we could make Vince do that, then you we could make Vince do that, then you would find our disclosure of going up would find our disclosure of going up would find our disclosure of going up where I could go again to Omar or to uh where I could go again to Omar or to uh where I could go again to Omar or to uh an open source project or another CNA an open source project or another CNA an open source project or another CNA where they can actually be included. So, where they can actually be included. So, where they can actually be included. So, we've had problems right now about we've had problems right now about we've had problems right now about bringing some of the open- source stuff bringing some of the open- source stuff bringing some of the open- source stuff in there and getting people included who in there and getting people included who in there and getting people included who need to be there because they actually need to be there because they actually need to be there because they actually control the code as to a lot others control the code as to a lot others control the code as to a lot others included. So coordinated disclosure included. So coordinated disclosure included. So coordinated disclosure actually requires do you have a need actually requires do you have a need actually requires do you have a need prior to public prior to public prior to public disclosure and that's why I think the disclosure and that's why I think the disclosure and that's why I think the word disclosure is word disclosure is word disclosure is incorrect because disclosure is so broad incorrect because disclosure is so broad incorrect because disclosure is so broad that we have to talk about is there a that we have to talk about is there a that we have to talk about is there a further further further notification for certain parties to notification for certain parties to notification for certain parties to protect large ecosystems protect large ecosystems protect large ecosystems and then going to a national sea doesn't and then going to a national sea doesn't and then going to a national sea doesn't guarantee that that's that's part of the guarantee that that's that's part of the guarantee that that's that's part of the challenge uh challenge uh challenge uh because well They classify it and they because well They classify it and they because well They classify it and they put it through all the channels of put it through all the channels of put it through all the channels of people who don't really need it as people who don't really need it as people who don't really need it as opposed to those who really need it but opposed to those who really need it but opposed to those who really need it but can't get to it now because it's can't get to it now because it's can't get to it now because it's classified. So you run into a host of classified. So you run into a host of classified. So you run into a host of problem sets and I say that having spent problem sets and I say that having spent problem sets and I say that having spent time in the IC. Okay. So I get that. time in the IC. Okay. So I get that. time in the IC. Okay. So I get that. Okay. So I'm hearing challenges of Okay. So I'm hearing challenges of Okay. So I'm hearing challenges of convening all the stakeholders as a part convening all the stakeholders as a part convening all the stakeholders as a part of coordinating. Yeah. I I don't think that a single Yeah. I I don't think that a single Yeah. I I don't think that a single central platform will solve that problem central platform will solve that problem central platform will solve that problem for us. Um I'm pretty much looking for us. Um I'm pretty much looking for us. Um I'm pretty much looking forward to Voltron um as a protocol forward to Voltron um as a protocol forward to Voltron um as a protocol stack or as uh a decentralized protocol stack or as uh a decentralized protocol stack or as uh a decentralized protocol um to do such things. Um can you tell us um to do such things. Um can you tell us um to do such things. Um can you tell us more about that? more about that? more about that? Uh so you should know about that since Uh so you should know about that since Uh so you should know about that since it's developed for the audience. uh it's it's developed for the audience. uh it's it's developed for the audience. uh it's developed at third CC um looking into developed at third CC um looking into developed at third CC um looking into what would be a state machine of of CVD what would be a state machine of of CVD what would be a state machine of of CVD basically and how do we communicate basically and how do we communicate basically and how do we communicate messages in that state machine um how messages in that state machine um how messages in that state machine um how can participants in that um ecosystem can participants in that um ecosystem can participants in that um ecosystem know in which state everyone is how do know in which state everyone is how do know in which state everyone is how do we agree on the disclosure date um as we agree on the disclosure date um as we agree on the disclosure date um as much as much as much as I like pre-disclosures and and getting I like pre-disclosures and and getting I like pre-disclosures and and getting information beforehand, being able to information beforehand, being able to information beforehand, being able to prepare it, to review it, and um giving prepare it, to review it, and um giving prepare it, to review it, and um giving feedback since usually the questions I feedback since usually the questions I feedback since usually the questions I have also your customers have. have also your customers have. have also your customers have. Um I um don't care whether I get it Um I um don't care whether I get it Um I um don't care whether I get it predisclosed. predisclosed. predisclosed. Um I'm totally fine with getting the Um I'm totally fine with getting the Um I'm totally fine with getting the advisory on on the advisory day as long advisory on on the advisory day as long advisory on on the advisory day as long as it is machine readable in CF. Um as it is machine readable in CF. Um as it is machine readable in CF. Um since then it flows automatically in my since then it flows automatically in my since then it flows automatically in my system and I can um evaluate that uh in system and I can um evaluate that uh in system and I can um evaluate that uh in in a blink um without having uh any in a blink um without having uh any in a blink um without having uh any media break in between. um I have my media break in between. um I have my media break in between. um I have my analysts spot on there um and I don't analysts spot on there um and I don't analysts spot on there um and I don't need to go to a vendor website and and need to go to a vendor website and and need to go to a vendor website and and try to figure out what's there. Um so try to figure out what's there. Um so try to figure out what's there. Um so yeah, I think machine readability is uh yeah, I think machine readability is uh yeah, I think machine readability is uh is key if you want to get rid of the is key if you want to get rid of the is key if you want to get rid of the pre-disclosure pre-disclosure pre-disclosure and basically disclosing everything to and basically disclosing everything to and basically disclosing everything to to everyone then just make it public. to everyone then just make it public. to everyone then just make it public. there is there's no point in there is there's no point in there is there's no point in predisclosure if the predisclosure group predisclosure if the predisclosure group predisclosure if the predisclosure group is bigger than um yeah the customer is bigger than um yeah the customer is bigger than um yeah the customer size. Um so this is my my point on size. Um so this is my my point on size. Um so this is my my point on pre-disclosure. Um so really we need to pre-disclosure. Um so really we need to pre-disclosure. Um so really we need to come back to CBD as uh need to know come back to CBD as uh need to know come back to CBD as uh need to know principle. So not just because somebody principle. So not just because somebody principle. So not just because somebody could be involved they they're on the could be involved they they're on the could be involved they they're on the case. Um so if there is clear evidence case. Um so if there is clear evidence case. Um so if there is clear evidence that they have the vulnerability or that that they have the vulnerability or that that they have the vulnerability or that they are involved um in in a certain they are involved um in in a certain they are involved um in in a certain space then yes they have a right to be space then yes they have a right to be space then yes they have a right to be on the case but um it is it is not an on the case but um it is it is not an on the case but um it is it is not an automatic measure. Oh they do something automatic measure. Oh they do something automatic measure. Oh they do something with IP let's include them on on all with IP let's include them on on all with IP let's include them on on all network stack vulnerability. Um that network stack vulnerability. Um that network stack vulnerability. Um that that doesn't make sense to me. Um, and that doesn't make sense to me. Um, and that doesn't make sense to me. Um, and that might lead up to a stage where we that might lead up to a stage where we that might lead up to a stage where we miss a vendor or two on the case. Um, miss a vendor or two on the case. Um, miss a vendor or two on the case. Um, but we're we're not over reporting and but we're we're not over reporting and but we're we're not over reporting and that should also help the case load for that should also help the case load for that should also help the case load for the vendors. No, I I hear you. And I I think part of No, I I hear you. And I I think part of No, I I hear you. And I I think part of the rub was um because of the nature the rub was um because of the nature the rub was um because of the nature events, we're always predisclosing to events, we're always predisclosing to events, we're always predisclosing to US-based US-based US-based It used to be ICSert RIP um It used to be ICSert RIP um It used to be ICSert RIP um SIZA analysts right and so I think that SIZA analysts right and so I think that SIZA analysts right and so I think that there was there was some friction with there was there was some friction with there was there was some friction with internationalerts about if SIZA gets to internationalerts about if SIZA gets to internationalerts about if SIZA gets to have analysts working pre-disclosure on have analysts working pre-disclosure on have analysts working pre-disclosure on this why don't we right and I think this why don't we right and I think this why don't we right and I think exactly to your point if I include one exactly to your point if I include one exactly to your point if I include one analyst from every globally all of a analyst from every globally all of a analyst from every globally all of a sudden we we aren't really working with sudden we we aren't really working with sudden we we aren't really working with the private CVD anymore the private CVD anymore the private CVD anymore um and I guess I would be curious to um and I guess I would be curious to um and I guess I would be curious to hear other folks thoughts that is a hear other folks thoughts that is a hear other folks thoughts that is a would a viable workaround for that be in would a viable workaround for that be in would a viable workaround for that be in try instead of trying to include try instead of trying to include try instead of trying to include everyert globally everyert globally everyert globally um can we get a mapping of these these x um can we get a mapping of these these x um can we get a mapping of these these x number of number of number of vendors cover 90% of vendors cover 90% of vendors cover 90% of EDR and maybe I don't actually give you EDR and maybe I don't actually give you EDR and maybe I don't actually give you the vulnerability but I can give you the the vulnerability but I can give you the the vulnerability but I can give you the rule set rule set rule set so that you have rules in place prior to so that you have rules in place prior to so that you have rules in place prior to disclosure that have been pushed to the disclosure that have been pushed to the disclosure that have been pushed to the customer and I might not have actually customer and I might not have actually customer and I might not have actually given you necessarily all of the breakdown of like necessarily all of the breakdown of like necessarily all of the breakdown of like the proof of concept of the the proof of concept of the the proof of concept of the vulnerability but you have you know vulnerability but you have you know vulnerability but you have you know snort rules or whatever you need to push snort rules or whatever you need to push snort rules or whatever you need to push out to the customers and so we have out to the customers and so we have out to the customers and so we have pre-proction ahead of disclosure because pre-proction ahead of disclosure because pre-proction ahead of disclosure because we all know especially in critical we all know especially in critical we all know especially in critical infrastructure the patching rate anyways infrastructure the patching rate anyways infrastructure the patching rate anyways once I give you that actual disclosure These are lessons of the old beards, These are lessons of the old beards, These are lessons of the old beards, great beards. Okay. Uh once upon a time great beards. Okay. Uh once upon a time great beards. Okay. Uh once upon a time when Ken and I were on the first board, when Ken and I were on the first board, when Ken and I were on the first board, we were in a place called the Canary we were in a place called the Canary we were in a place called the Canary Islands. Islands. Islands. We were there with We were there with We were there with TFCERT. TFCERT and FIRST both decided TFCERT. TFCERT and FIRST both decided TFCERT. TFCERT and FIRST both decided that we're going to compile that that we're going to compile that that we're going to compile that list. Can we ever compile that list? Yeah. That's when we only had 300 list? Yeah. That's when we only had 300 list? Yeah. That's when we only had 300 members of first. Now they're at 770 members of first. Now they're at 770 members of first. Now they're at 770 something. Okay. The vast majority of something. Okay. The vast majority of something. Okay. The vast majority of first is really seerts. first is really seerts. first is really seerts. So that's why 10 years ago, 11 years So that's why 10 years ago, 11 years So that's why 10 years ago, 11 years ago, we started doing the PERS sig and ago, we started doing the PERS sig and ago, we started doing the PERS sig and started doing the TC's because we found started doing the TC's because we found started doing the TC's because we found that we need to know each that we need to know each that we need to know each other. So we do a lot of exchange now. other. So we do a lot of exchange now. other. So we do a lot of exchange now. We're mostly on We're mostly on We're mostly on keybase. Why? Because that's where we keybase. Why? Because that's where we keybase. Why? Because that's where we went and we're too stubborn to change. went and we're too stubborn to change. went and we're too stubborn to change. So when you look at somebody's name, it So when you look at somebody's name, it So when you look at somebody's name, it comes up as pizza one. comes up as pizza one. comes up as pizza one. We know who that p person is. That's We know who that p person is. That's We know who that p person is. That's where we exchange our data. So, it's a where we exchange our data. So, it's a where we exchange our data. So, it's a lot lot lot less formal, but it's more regular. It's less formal, but it's more regular. It's less formal, but it's more regular. It's more more more trusted. And from there, we actually trusted. And from there, we actually trusted. And from there, we actually work things. So, I'll give an example. work things. So, I'll give an example. work things. So, I'll give an example. We work DNS We work DNS We work DNS mask. Kind of important to a lot of mask. Kind of important to a lot of mask. Kind of important to a lot of people. We couldn't find the people. We couldn't find the people. We couldn't find the maintainer for 4 months. maintainer for 4 months. maintainer for 4 months. He decided to take a He decided to take a He decided to take a break. We had to break. We had to break. We had to coordinate. We actually wrote a patch. coordinate. We actually wrote a patch. coordinate. We actually wrote a patch. Red Hat wrote the patch. We were all Red Hat wrote the patch. We were all Red Hat wrote the patch. We were all like, "Oh god, we're end up forking this like, "Oh god, we're end up forking this like, "Oh god, we're end up forking this card. We don't want to do card. We don't want to do card. We don't want to do this." And the guy shows up and says, this." And the guy shows up and says, this." And the guy shows up and says, "What do you mean there's a "What do you mean there's a "What do you mean there's a problem?" So, we all helped him out. But problem?" So, we all helped him out. But problem?" So, we all helped him out. But that is how we work it through. And it that is how we work it through. And it that is how we work it through. And it was actually a global set of people was actually a global set of people was actually a global set of people working it. But you notice that while we working it. But you notice that while we working it. But you notice that while we were treating it very sensitive for the were treating it very sensitive for the were treating it very sensitive for the companies and I I'll just name two that companies and I I'll just name two that companies and I I'll just name two that were a part of it. Cisco and Google were a part of it. Cisco and Google were a part of it. Cisco and Google while Red Hat, but there was a lot more while Red Hat, but there was a lot more while Red Hat, but there was a lot more of of of us. I didn't say to Andrew or to to Omar us. I didn't say to Andrew or to to Omar us. I didn't say to Andrew or to to Omar who they could tell inside the who they could tell inside the who they could tell inside the orgs. Okay, we treat treat just like a orgs. Okay, we treat treat just like a orgs. Okay, we treat treat just like a TLP red. It TLP red. It TLP red. It worked, you know. So sometimes the worked, you know. So sometimes the worked, you know. So sometimes the formality of a system has so many ifs, formality of a system has so many ifs, formality of a system has so many ifs, what'ss been then and and and people what'ss been then and and and people what'ss been then and and and people have to be included um that it becomes have to be included um that it becomes have to be included um that it becomes unworkable. We also knew in that part unworkable. We also knew in that part unworkable. We also knew in that part that we had a lot of critical that we had a lot of critical that we had a lot of critical infrastructure to take care of. We infrastructure to take care of. We infrastructure to take care of. We didn't need a government to tell us didn't need a government to tell us didn't need a government to tell us that. They're called a that. They're called a that. They're called a customer. If the customers don't work, customer. If the customers don't work, customer. If the customers don't work, they complain. they complain. they complain. So once I went and spoke to the So once I went and spoke to the So once I went and spoke to the financial financial financial services and talked about the group services and talked about the group services and talked about the group called IIcazi which is now folding the called IIcazi which is now folding the called IIcazi which is now folding the pie sig and we were all major vendors pie sig and we were all major vendors pie sig and we were all major vendors and we said well we're going to exchange and we said well we're going to exchange and we said well we're going to exchange things. You know what the financers is things. You know what the financers is things. You know what the financers is leadership said to leadership said to leadership said to us we thought that's what you already us we thought that's what you already us we thought that's what you already did. They assumed did. They assumed did. They assumed that. So, a lot of people are making a that. So, a lot of people are making a that. So, a lot of people are making a deal out of we've got to make it formal deal out of we've got to make it formal deal out of we've got to make it formal when the assumption is already there and when the assumption is already there and when the assumption is already there and the work has been the work has been the work has been ongoing since the Barcelona first ongoing since the Barcelona first ongoing since the Barcelona first conference. That was what conference. That was what conference. That was what 2006 something like that. So, we've been 2006 something like that. So, we've been 2006 something like that. So, we've been very formally doing that because we very formally doing that because we very formally doing that because we realize realize there's multiple tiers realize realize there's multiple tiers realize realize there's multiple tiers of who needs me of who needs me of who needs me notified and that waiting for someone notified and that waiting for someone notified and that waiting for someone else to kind of lead us there didn't else to kind of lead us there didn't else to kind of lead us there didn't work. We put a lot of good money into work. We put a lot of good money into work. We put a lot of good money into it. We've just expanded it without it. We've just expanded it without it. We've just expanded it without keeping the formal organization with keeping the formal organization with keeping the formal organization with collecting dues that some of us pay collecting dues that some of us pay collecting dues that some of us pay $200,000 a $200,000 a $200,000 a year. So, I think it's there. The year. So, I think it's there. The year. So, I think it's there. The challenge now is and this is something challenge now is and this is something challenge now is and this is something in a piece sig that we've talked about in a piece sig that we've talked about in a piece sig that we've talked about actively uh Derek Scho myself and Josh actively uh Derek Scho myself and Josh actively uh Derek Scho myself and Josh Demling um we're getting a little Demling um we're getting a little Demling um we're getting a little gray so we're now we're working on the gray so we're now we're working on the gray so we're now we're working on the leadership to follow leadership to follow leadership to follow us because folks like yourself are us because folks like yourself are us because folks like yourself are asking great questions and you need to asking great questions and you need to asking great questions and you need to hear how do we solve that? That doesn't hear how do we solve that? That doesn't hear how do we solve that? That doesn't mean that's the answer. That means you mean that's the answer. That means you mean that's the answer. That means you have the experience and you can modify have the experience and you can modify have the experience and you can modify it. You can work with it. So I would it. You can work with it. So I would it. You can work with it. So I would encourage you to become a member of encourage you to become a member of encourage you to become a member of those kind of groups so that we can tell those kind of groups so that we can tell those kind of groups so that we can tell you well this is how we failed. There was a national strategy failed. There was a national strategy failed. There was a national strategy secure cyerspace that was put out by the secure cyerspace that was put out by the secure cyerspace that was put out by the Bush White House and in there we had a Bush White House and in there we had a Bush White House and in there we had a little problem being uh discussed before little problem being uh discussed before little problem being uh discussed before they invaded Iraq. It was a problem with they invaded Iraq. It was a problem with they invaded Iraq. It was a problem with send mail to the Verizon's comment. Uh send mail to the Verizon's comment. Uh send mail to the Verizon's comment. Uh we had done a penetration test and then we had done a penetration test and then we had done a penetration test and then our researchers found another our researchers found another our researchers found another problem. We coordinated with the problem. We coordinated with the problem. We coordinated with the government but we didn't tell the White government but we didn't tell the White government but we didn't tell the White House and they said well you have to do House and they said well you have to do House and they said well you have to do it that way. He says well your strategy it that way. He says well your strategy it that way. He says well your strategy says no. You know so Howard Schmidt was says no. You know so Howard Schmidt was says no. You know so Howard Schmidt was threatening President Bush to call Tom threatening President Bush to call Tom threatening President Bush to call Tom Nune my CEO at the time. Nune my CEO at the time. Nune my CEO at the time. We did it because we need to do it. And We did it because we need to do it. And We did it because we need to do it. And it was the major affected vendors it was the major affected vendors it was the major affected vendors allowing us, the researchers, to allowing us, the researchers, to allowing us, the researchers, to coordinate with people to make sure we coordinate with people to make sure we coordinate with people to make sure we didn't kill critical infrastructure at a didn't kill critical infrastructure at a didn't kill critical infrastructure at a a very important time for a lot of a very important time for a lot of a very important time for a lot of people who had lives on the people who had lives on the people who had lives on the line. So realize I think that a lot of line. So realize I think that a lot of line. So realize I think that a lot of times look at vendors as well, they're times look at vendors as well, they're times look at vendors as well, they're just cashing in on on customers. No, we just cashing in on on customers. No, we just cashing in on on customers. No, we we actually understand it as a fiduciary we actually understand it as a fiduciary we actually understand it as a fiduciary duty. That's a big statement to say. So duty. That's a big statement to say. So duty. That's a big statement to say. So I I welcome you to that community I I welcome you to that community I I welcome you to that community because Omar's got because Omar's got because Omar's got guys, I've got guys, Microsoft's got guys, I've got guys, Microsoft's got guys, I've got guys, Microsoft's got folks, Verizon's got folks, Verizon's got folks, Verizon's got folks, you know, all of us do. And and folks, you know, all of us do. And and folks, you know, all of us do. And and they know each other. And you just need they know each other. And you just need they know each other. And you just need to be part of that community. to be part of that community. to be part of that community. It doesn't mean we don't use Vince. We It doesn't mean we don't use Vince. We It doesn't mean we don't use Vince. We do, but we understand its do, but we understand its do, but we understand its limitations to some of our limitations to some of our limitations to some of our coordinations. So, you use the right coordinations. So, you use the right coordinations. So, you use the right tool at the appropriate time and you tool at the appropriate time and you tool at the appropriate time and you just need to learn about some of those just need to learn about some of those just need to learn about some of those other tools. Sorry for that. Uh I don't mean tools. Sorry for that. Uh I don't mean tools. Sorry for that. Uh I don't mean to be to be to be preachy. No, Pete, that's super great. preachy. No, Pete, that's super great. preachy. No, Pete, that's super great. And uh I know we surveyed the room and And uh I know we surveyed the room and And uh I know we surveyed the room and there's people in here who have been there's people in here who have been there's people in here who have been doing CBD for 15 20 plus years. And so I doing CBD for 15 20 plus years. And so I doing CBD for 15 20 plus years. And so I uh recommend that we all get to know you uh recommend that we all get to know you uh recommend that we all get to know you all and you know seek that guidance and all and you know seek that guidance and all and you know seek that guidance and that advice. And I'm so glad that that advice. And I'm so glad that that advice. And I'm so glad that everyone's here in this room today to everyone's here in this room today to everyone's here in this room today to build those relationships because it's a build those relationships because it's a build those relationships because it's a very small community, vulnerability very small community, vulnerability very small community, vulnerability community. And so I think just being in community. And so I think just being in community. And so I think just being in this room, seeing each other's faces, this room, seeing each other's faces, this room, seeing each other's faces, you know, connecting afterwards, having you know, connecting afterwards, having you know, connecting afterwards, having these types of kind of informal these types of kind of informal these types of kind of informal conversations is really crucial towards conversations is really crucial towards conversations is really crucial towards again securing systems, securing our again securing systems, securing our again securing systems, securing our customers, securing the nation. I know customers, securing the nation. I know customers, securing the nation. I know Thomas, you had a comment. Thomas, you had a comment. Thomas, you had a comment. And now something totally different. And now something totally different. And now something totally different. Take it away. Yeah. So um what I want to Take it away. Yeah. So um what I want to Take it away. Yeah. So um what I want to to tackle on is the coordinator role. to tackle on is the coordinator role. to tackle on is the coordinator role. Um, from my perspective, a coordinator Um, from my perspective, a coordinator Um, from my perspective, a coordinator should only be there if there is really should only be there if there is really should only be there if there is really a need for the coordinator. There are so a need for the coordinator. There are so a need for the coordinator. There are so many cases out there where um you have many cases out there where um you have many cases out there where um you have an unexperienced researcher or you have an unexperienced researcher or you have an unexperienced researcher or you have an unexperienced company uh that really an unexperienced company uh that really an unexperienced company uh that really need that guidance. Sure. And that need need that guidance. Sure. And that need need that guidance. Sure. And that need your time. And so we have um done cases your time. And so we have um done cases your time. And so we have um done cases where we say let's do it in in a way where we say let's do it in in a way where we say let's do it in in a way that we train the people on their first that we train the people on their first that we train the people on their first case that hopefully they can run their case that hopefully they can run their case that hopefully they can run their second case on their own. second case on their own. second case on their own. um that uses a lot of resources to get um that uses a lot of resources to get um that uses a lot of resources to get the first one right and and to tell them the first one right and and to tell them the first one right and and to tell them what to do and how to do it and what's what to do and how to do it and what's what to do and how to do it and what's the next step, when do we meet again and the next step, when do we meet again and the next step, when do we meet again and and discuss the results of the last week and discuss the results of the last week and discuss the results of the last week or whatever. Um but it has been quite or whatever. Um but it has been quite or whatever. Um but it has been quite successful. So that um after a while I successful. So that um after a while I successful. So that um after a while I got a call and they said, "Yeah, we we got a call and they said, "Yeah, we we got a call and they said, "Yeah, we we had our our cases set up, our program um had our our cases set up, our program um had our our cases set up, our program um stood up after the first case rerun with stood up after the first case rerun with stood up after the first case rerun with you and now we have a special case. We you and now we have a special case. We you and now we have a special case. We don't really know what to do. Um could don't really know what to do. Um could don't really know what to do. Um could we come back to you?" And I say, "Yeah, we come back to you?" And I say, "Yeah, we come back to you?" And I say, "Yeah, sure." sure." sure." Um there was some researcher that wanted Um there was some researcher that wanted Um there was some researcher that wanted to get money to get money to get money for before disclosing the vulnerability for before disclosing the vulnerability for before disclosing the vulnerability and so um yeah that was was an and so um yeah that was was an and so um yeah that was was an interesting case at the end. interesting case at the end. interesting case at the end. Um but what I think is um if you are a Um but what I think is um if you are a Um but what I think is um if you are a mature PR then you don't need a mature PR then you don't need a mature PR then you don't need a coordinator. If the researcher wants a coordinator. If the researcher wants a coordinator. If the researcher wants a coordinator coordinator coordinator um okay up to to the researcher um we're um okay up to to the researcher um we're um okay up to to the researcher um we're not uh if if somebody wants us to be in not uh if if somebody wants us to be in not uh if if somebody wants us to be in the case and we join the case but if the case and we join the case but if the case and we join the case but if it's not necessarily then we we try to it's not necessarily then we we try to it's not necessarily then we we try to talk to them and say hey it's a mature talk to them and say hey it's a mature talk to them and say hey it's a mature pet suit you can work with them and if pet suit you can work with them and if pet suit you can work with them and if something goes wrong you can always come something goes wrong you can always come something goes wrong you can always come back to us and we know um and I can pick back to us and we know um and I can pick back to us and we know um and I can pick up the phone and say, "Hey, what what's up the phone and say, "Hey, what what's up the phone and say, "Hey, what what's happening in this case? I got a happening in this case? I got a happening in this case? I got a complaint or whatever." Um for me, the complaint or whatever." Um for me, the complaint or whatever." Um for me, the coordinator role is to bring PERS up to coordinator role is to bring PERS up to coordinator role is to bring PERS up to speed or to bring companies up to speed speed or to bring companies up to speed speed or to bring companies up to speed so that they have PERS. uh it's not the so that they have PERS. uh it's not the so that they have PERS. uh it's not the every day vulnerability coordination but every day vulnerability coordination but every day vulnerability coordination but it's the the first run in the it's the the first run in the it's the the first run in the vulnerability coordination. And then vulnerability coordination. And then vulnerability coordination. And then there is also the the small part of the there is also the the small part of the there is also the the small part of the multi-party coordination where if you multi-party coordination where if you multi-party coordination where if you don't if you're if you don't have the don't if you're if you don't have the don't if you're if you don't have the capacity to do it on your own then feel capacity to do it on your own then feel capacity to do it on your own then feel free to reach out to a coordinator and free to reach out to a coordinator and free to reach out to a coordinator and even we as coordinators um if I think uh even we as coordinators um if I think uh even we as coordinators um if I think uh about amnesia 33 um we might even get about amnesia 33 um we might even get about amnesia 33 um we might even get together and and split it up together and and split it up together and and split it up geographically or whatever um to help geographically or whatever um to help geographically or whatever um to help ourselves lower the case load and ourselves lower the case load and ourselves lower the case load and improve the quality for each uh improve the quality for each uh improve the quality for each uh individual company. individual company. individual company. And then Thomas, I know probably a lot And then Thomas, I know probably a lot And then Thomas, I know probably a lot of people know you in this room, but and of people know you in this room, but and of people know you in this room, but and I know where you're from, but can you I know where you're from, but can you I know where you're from, but can you tell everyone uh which national you're tell everyone uh which national you're tell everyone uh which national you're with? So, I'm with S Bund at BSI with? So, I'm with S Bund at BSI with? So, I'm with S Bund at BSI Germany. Germany. Germany. Thank Thank Thank you. Julia's got a comment over there in you. Julia's got a comment over there in you. Julia's got a comment over there in the the the corner. Julia is my amazing colleague at corner. Julia is my amazing colleague at corner. Julia is my amazing colleague at SIZA. She's our lead CNA recruiter and SIZA. She's our lead CNA recruiter and SIZA. She's our lead CNA recruiter and she talks with CNAs every single day. she talks with CNAs every single day. she talks with CNAs every single day. Yeah, thank you Rita. Um, you are also Yeah, thank you Rita. Um, you are also Yeah, thank you Rita. Um, you are also my amazing colleague and thank you to my amazing colleague and thank you to my amazing colleague and thank you to you're an amazing peer. So, thanks for you're an amazing peer. So, thanks for you're an amazing peer. So, thanks for all your work in leading this. Um, I all your work in leading this. Um, I all your work in leading this. Um, I wanted to add that uh the roots in the wanted to add that uh the roots in the wanted to add that uh the roots in the CVE program serve as that coordinator CVE program serve as that coordinator CVE program serve as that coordinator mentor a lot of times. I know at CISA we mentor a lot of times. I know at CISA we mentor a lot of times. I know at CISA we do I know talking with JPET and sorry do I know talking with JPET and sorry do I know talking with JPET and sorry Christian pointing you out in CBE right Christian pointing you out in CBE right Christian pointing you out in CBE right here. um we take that role as bringing here. um we take that role as bringing here. um we take that role as bringing PERTS up to speed very seriously. It's PERTS up to speed very seriously. It's PERTS up to speed very seriously. It's part of our CNA recruitment strategy. Um part of our CNA recruitment strategy. Um part of our CNA recruitment strategy. Um is that organizational maturity and so is that organizational maturity and so is that organizational maturity and so some CNAs come to us and they're like, some CNAs come to us and they're like, some CNAs come to us and they're like, "Yep, we have our vulnerability "Yep, we have our vulnerability "Yep, we have our vulnerability disclosure policy. We have our public disclosure policy. We have our public disclosure policy. We have our public advisories ready to go. Um all we need advisories ready to go. Um all we need advisories ready to go. Um all we need is just to be a numbering authority and is just to be a numbering authority and is just to be a numbering authority and to let us keep going and disclosing to let us keep going and disclosing to let us keep going and disclosing vulnerabilities." other organizations. vulnerabilities." other organizations. vulnerabilities." other organizations. We have CISA has served as the We have CISA has served as the We have CISA has served as the third-party coordinator in a case and third-party coordinator in a case and third-party coordinator in a case and we've said, "Hey, you you did really we've said, "Hey, you you did really we've said, "Hey, you you did really good on this first case. Why don't you good on this first case. Why don't you good on this first case. Why don't you become a CNA and um so you can assign become a CNA and um so you can assign become a CNA and um so you can assign the CVE in the future on your own?" Um the CVE in the future on your own?" Um the CVE in the future on your own?" Um and so kind of to your point that and so kind of to your point that and so kind of to your point that coordinators should be there when there coordinators should be there when there coordinators should be there when there is an inexperienced organization, the is an inexperienced organization, the is an inexperienced organization, the roots help do that. And I know at CISA roots help do that. And I know at CISA roots help do that. And I know at CISA we also kind of cultivate that knowledge we also kind of cultivate that knowledge we also kind of cultivate that knowledge of CVD. Um and I know that's part of the of CVD. Um and I know that's part of the of CVD. Um and I know that's part of the CVD uh coordinated or community of CVD uh coordinated or community of CVD uh coordinated or community of practice that um Tommo is helping lead. practice that um Tommo is helping lead. practice that um Tommo is helping lead. No, completely Julian. I know you've No, completely Julian. I know you've No, completely Julian. I know you've done such tremendous work as uh the lead done such tremendous work as uh the lead done such tremendous work as uh the lead CNA recruiter and uh a lot of the leads CNA recruiter and uh a lot of the leads CNA recruiter and uh a lot of the leads that we do and did get were from our that we do and did get were from our that we do and did get were from our coordinated vulnerability disclosure coordinated vulnerability disclosure coordinated vulnerability disclosure work and we saw entities that were doing work and we saw entities that were doing work and we saw entities that were doing a great job and we're like hey you guys a great job and we're like hey you guys a great job and we're like hey you guys should be a numbering authority and should be a numbering authority and should be a numbering authority and contribute to the ecosystem. contribute to the ecosystem. contribute to the ecosystem. One quick comment actually I think that One quick comment actually I think that One quick comment actually I think that I mean this is a very complex problem I mean this is a very complex problem I mean this is a very complex problem that we have tried to solve for many that we have tried to solve for many that we have tried to solve for many years and we're in the in the bad news years and we're in the in the bad news years and we're in the in the bad news business too. So it doesn't doesn't business too. So it doesn't doesn't business too. So it doesn't doesn't help. So the first thing is actually help. So the first thing is actually help. So the first thing is actually even though it's not perfect. Thank you. even though it's not perfect. Thank you. even though it's not perfect. Thank you. This is a really bad shitty job. This is a really bad shitty job. This is a really bad shitty job. um you know trying to keep a rolodex on um you know trying to keep a rolodex on um you know trying to keep a rolodex on who to actually you know uh please who to actually you know uh please who to actually you know uh please somewhere around the world. Second one somewhere around the world. Second one somewhere around the world. Second one is you know how some companies actually is you know how some companies actually is you know how some companies actually it's really easy to find who to contact it's really easy to find who to contact it's really easy to find who to contact other ones you know don't assist the other ones you know don't assist the other ones you know don't assist the other ones get acquired they change the other ones get acquired they change the other ones get acquired they change the names and it's is significant right so names and it's is significant right so names and it's is significant right so so first of all thank you second thank so first of all thank you second thank so first of all thank you second thank you for contributing to standards and you for contributing to standards and you for contributing to standards and specifically to Thomas I'm going to put specifically to Thomas I'm going to put specifically to Thomas I'm going to put him on the spot in there and what I want him on the spot in there and what I want him on the spot in there and what I want to actually drive is we cannot solve the to actually drive is we cannot solve the to actually drive is we cannot solve the problem the way that we're dealing right problem the way that we're dealing right problem the way that we're dealing right now with this we have to think about you now with this we have to think about you now with this we have to think about you know a lot of things already assist you know a lot of things already assist you know a lot of things already assist you know how can I find if a vendor actually know how can I find if a vendor actually know how can I find if a vendor actually has a piece or team on who to contact has a piece or team on who to contact has a piece or team on who to contact again I mentioned security of the text again I mentioned security of the text again I mentioned security of the text I'm not going to you know repeat that in I'm not going to you know repeat that in I'm not going to you know repeat that in there then the second one is if I am I'm there then the second one is if I am I'm there then the second one is if I am I'm always saying if I'm disclosing always saying if I'm disclosing always saying if I'm disclosing vulnerabilities or even communicating to vulnerabilities or even communicating to vulnerabilities or even communicating to a human I'm already failing uh we need a human I'm already failing uh we need a human I'm already failing uh we need to think about you know this is in a to think about you know this is in a to think about you know this is in a scale that is going to get a lot worse scale that is going to get a lot worse scale that is going to get a lot worse so we have to think about the meth so we have to think about the meth so we have to think about the meth methodology of you know trust in systems methodology of you know trust in systems methodology of you know trust in systems that can exchange is information that is that can exchange is information that is that can exchange is information that is fast that then a pie or a customer or a fast that then a pie or a customer or a fast that then a pie or a customer or a coordinator and so on you know can act coordinator and so on you know can act coordinator and so on you know can act upon it what Pete was mentioning is is upon it what Pete was mentioning is is upon it what Pete was mentioning is is spot on in some things and actually what spot on in some things and actually what spot on in some things and actually what Thomas mentioned after that in some Thomas mentioned after that in some Thomas mentioned after that in some cases you don't need the coordination cases you don't need the coordination cases you don't need the coordination you know it's only two vendors that you know it's only two vendors that you know it's only two vendors that probably may be affected but the probably may be affected but the probably may be affected but the challenge in some cases is that even if challenge in some cases is that even if challenge in some cases is that even if you're doing that type of you're doing that type of you're doing that type of coordination always always think does coordination always always think does coordination always always think does this vulnerability affect somebody this vulnerability affect somebody this vulnerability affect somebody can affect you know and I'm not talking can affect you know and I'm not talking can affect you know and I'm not talking about just open source that of course about just open source that of course about just open source that of course it's going to affect somebody else but it's going to affect somebody else but it's going to affect somebody else but um because this vulnerability has a um because this vulnerability has a um because this vulnerability has a repercussion of you know a specific repercussion of you know a specific repercussion of you know a specific vendor and it's really hard to actually vendor and it's really hard to actually vendor and it's really hard to actually determine that if you don't know then determine that if you don't know then determine that if you don't know then that's whenever you can get seek that's whenever you can get seek that's whenever you can get seek guidance from the coordinators because guidance from the coordinators because guidance from the coordinators because they're seeing this on a daily basis so they're seeing this on a daily basis so they're seeing this on a daily basis so but thank you I think we had a comment but thank you I think we had a comment but thank you I think we had a comment over there in the over there in the over there in the back and for those of you who don't know back and for those of you who don't know back and for those of you who don't know Omar he's with Cisco and he's Omar he's with Cisco and he's Omar he's with Cisco and he's amazing in the spirit of just amazing in the spirit of just amazing in the spirit of just introducing everybody and knowing who introducing everybody and knowing who introducing everybody and knowing who all the folks are. all the folks are. all the folks are. Yeah. Thanks. Uh Ken Van Wick here um hi Yeah. Thanks. Uh Ken Van Wick here um hi Yeah. Thanks. Uh Ken Van Wick here um hi formerly of Someone's bowing down behind formerly of Someone's bowing down behind formerly of Someone's bowing down behind you. No, no. So, you. No, no. So, you. No, no. So, um my message is simple. Let's um first um my message is simple. Let's um first um my message is simple. Let's um first of all, it's amazing how far we've come of all, it's amazing how far we've come of all, it's amazing how far we've come and and and let's also keep in mind and and and let's also keep in mind and and and let's also keep in mind where we were. Um 1989 when the Carnegie where we were. Um 1989 when the Carnegie where we were. Um 1989 when the Carnegie Melonert was first set up, we were Melonert was first set up, we were Melonert was first set up, we were chartered to be what we would now call a chartered to be what we would now call a chartered to be what we would now call a seaert. We were there to help sites when seaert. We were there to help sites when seaert. We were there to help sites when they got hit and we'd provide them with they got hit and we'd provide them with they got hit and we'd provide them with technical guidance and whatnot. But very technical guidance and whatnot. But very technical guidance and whatnot. But very quickly, we started running into quickly, we started running into quickly, we started running into software vulnerabilities and how do we software vulnerabilities and how do we software vulnerabilities and how do we handle these things? And I can tell you handle these things? And I can tell you handle these things? And I can tell you from personal experience that um that from personal experience that um that from personal experience that um that first year of CERT operations, we first year of CERT operations, we first year of CERT operations, we contacted dozens of software vendors and contacted dozens of software vendors and contacted dozens of software vendors and frequently we were threatened with frequently we were threatened with frequently we were threatened with lawsuits uh in some cases personally. If lawsuits uh in some cases personally. If lawsuits uh in some cases personally. If you publish this, we will sue you you publish this, we will sue you you publish this, we will sue you personally. personally. personally. Um and so think about where we've been. Um and so think about where we've been. Um and so think about where we've been. You know, first off, it's amazing how You know, first off, it's amazing how You know, first off, it's amazing how how much more open the software how much more open the software how much more open the software community is now to people telling them, community is now to people telling them, community is now to people telling them, hey, I discovered a vulnerability in hey, I discovered a vulnerability in hey, I discovered a vulnerability in your code. Now it's accepted and you your code. Now it's accepted and you your code. Now it's accepted and you know, great, talk to our bound bounty or know, great, talk to our bound bounty or know, great, talk to our bound bounty or bug bounty people and let's go whatever. bug bounty people and let's go whatever. bug bounty people and let's go whatever. Um but the litmus test that we always Um but the litmus test that we always Um but the litmus test that we always applied at Cert in the early days when applied at Cert in the early days when applied at Cert in the early days when we would have a software vulnerability we would have a software vulnerability we would have a software vulnerability even in cases where we were being even in cases where we were being even in cases where we were being threatened by the software developer threatened by the software developer threatened by the software developer with lawsuits again personally sometimes with lawsuits again personally sometimes with lawsuits again personally sometimes the litmus test was does publishing this the litmus test was does publishing this the litmus test was does publishing this advisory make the problem bigger or advisory make the problem bigger or advisory make the problem bigger or smaller simple as that right is there a smaller simple as that right is there a smaller simple as that right is there a patch available is the patch working can patch available is the patch working can patch available is the patch working can the people readily get to that patch the people readily get to that patch the people readily get to that patch These are in the days where sometimes These are in the days where sometimes These are in the days where sometimes patches were distributed on CDROM, you patches were distributed on CDROM, you patches were distributed on CDROM, you know, not kidding. Um, so does know, not kidding. Um, so does know, not kidding. Um, so does publishing this advisory make the publishing this advisory make the publishing this advisory make the problem bigger or smaller? And we would problem bigger or smaller? And we would problem bigger or smaller? And we would have sometimes fierce debates internally have sometimes fierce debates internally have sometimes fierce debates internally before we would put out an advisory. But before we would put out an advisory. But before we would put out an advisory. But at the end of the day, we came to a at the end of the day, we came to a at the end of the day, we came to a consensus and we all agreed, yep, consensus and we all agreed, yep, consensus and we all agreed, yep, publishing this advisory was the right publishing this advisory was the right publishing this advisory was the right thing to do. Um, and sometimes those thing to do. Um, and sometimes those thing to do. Um, and sometimes those advisories went out under threat of advisories went out under threat of advisories went out under threat of lawsuit and it was still worth doing. So lawsuit and it was still worth doing. So lawsuit and it was still worth doing. So that's all I wanted to say. But thank that's all I wanted to say. But thank that's all I wanted to say. But thank you. It's it's amazing how far this you. It's it's amazing how far this you. It's it's amazing how far this community has come and and we should community has come and and we should community has come and and we should applaud that. Well, let's applaud that applaud that. Well, let's applaud that applaud that. Well, let's applaud that then. The problem is they The problem is they The problem is they still when people are new to disclosures still when people are new to disclosures still when people are new to disclosures being disclosed upon if you will, their being disclosed upon if you will, their being disclosed upon if you will, their knee-jerk reaction is knee-jerk reaction is knee-jerk reaction is sue. Okay. Um, and you heard that in the sue. Okay. Um, and you heard that in the sue. Okay. Um, and you heard that in the auto industry a couple years ago when auto industry a couple years ago when auto industry a couple years ago when Chris and and friends went ahead and Chris and and friends went ahead and Chris and and friends went ahead and stopped the Jeep on the highway. uh and stopped the Jeep on the highway. uh and stopped the Jeep on the highway. uh and and that is a is usually an initial and that is a is usually an initial and that is a is usually an initial reaction for those who are not reaction for those who are not reaction for those who are not aware and then it takes a while for them aware and then it takes a while for them aware and then it takes a while for them to kind of get with understanding I to kind of get with understanding I to kind of get with understanding I didn't say with the program they need a didn't say with the program they need a didn't say with the program they need a degree of understanding at a corporate degree of understanding at a corporate degree of understanding at a corporate level of what that level of what that level of what that means so I I would say to any means so I I would say to any means so I I would say to any organization and and by the way Ken is organization and and by the way Ken is organization and and by the way Ken is exactly on point with his comment exactly on point with his comment exactly on point with his comment so there is a so there is a so there is a problem. It's called software and problem. It's called software and problem. It's called software and humans. humans. humans. Okay? And for most people, the problem Okay? And for most people, the problem Okay? And for most people, the problem is the the big vendors, open source is the the big vendors, open source is the the big vendors, open source community says they don't do a great job community says they don't do a great job community says they don't do a great job or they they do poorly. You pick your or they they do poorly. You pick your or they they do poorly. You pick your your your adjective. Mhm. The issue is your your adjective. Mhm. The issue is your your adjective. Mhm. The issue is is they actually also produce software is they actually also produce software is they actually also produce software because they either have an app or a because they either have an app or a because they either have an app or a website and they do data in the back website and they do data in the back website and they do data in the back end. Some still in spreadsheets and end. Some still in spreadsheets and end. Some still in spreadsheets and Google Sheets, whatever, but they're Google Sheets, whatever, but they're Google Sheets, whatever, but they're they're doing something and as soon as they're doing something and as soon as they're doing something and as soon as they start writing code, they now are they start writing code, they now are they start writing code, they now are part of the part of the part of the problem. So people haven't extended that problem. So people haven't extended that problem. So people haven't extended that far down to think about how do they take far down to think about how do they take far down to think about how do they take on their problem sets. on their problem sets. on their problem sets. Then we have this uh we need to rev to Then we have this uh we need to rev to Then we have this uh we need to rev to the latest version which is actually a the latest version which is actually a the latest version which is actually a very poor choice because it's code that very poor choice because it's code that very poor choice because it's code that hasn't been really tested and now you're hasn't been really tested and now you're hasn't been really tested and now you're going to put all your cookies into this going to put all your cookies into this going to put all your cookies into this new code with no idea what's there. So new code with no idea what's there. So new code with no idea what's there. So you you have to think through what is you you have to think through what is you you have to think through what is that because having something say all that because having something say all that because having something say all vulnerabilities fixed I'll use that that vulnerabilities fixed I'll use that that vulnerabilities fixed I'll use that that famous moniker from customers uh famous moniker from customers uh famous moniker from customers uh consumers is everything has to be fixed consumers is everything has to be fixed consumers is everything has to be fixed and it's like yeah are you ready to do and it's like yeah are you ready to do and it's like yeah are you ready to do all your changes because the risk that all your changes because the risk that all your changes because the risk that you're introducing to your organization you're introducing to your organization you're introducing to your organization is actually two or three times is actually two or three times is actually two or three times more. So the the the point of the more. So the the the point of the more. So the the the point of the conversation there is we need to fix conversation there is we need to fix conversation there is we need to fix risk of appropriate risk of appropriate risk of appropriate items and that's part of what we do as items and that's part of what we do as items and that's part of what we do as part of CBD is how risky is this as to part of CBD is how risky is this as to part of CBD is how risky is this as to how many people we have to how many people we have to how many people we have to do in other words inform prior to going do in other words inform prior to going do in other words inform prior to going out. out. out. So we need to think through that and So we need to think through that and So we need to think through that and then when I look at people who need a then when I look at people who need a then when I look at people who need a CVE they don't need to be a CNA. CVE they don't need to be a CNA. CVE they don't need to be a CNA. Sorry, it's just not right. As a CVE Sorry, it's just not right. As a CVE Sorry, it's just not right. As a CVE board member, I push back against that. board member, I push back against that. board member, I push back against that. That's that's extremely That's that's extremely That's that's extremely poor. Because if they're only issuing poor. Because if they're only issuing poor. Because if they're only issuing one CVE every 3 one CVE every 3 one CVE every 3 years, I would say they're not a years, I would say they're not a years, I would say they're not a CNA. They can get CVES very easily from CNA. They can get CVES very easily from CNA. They can get CVES very easily from the the the program. And when we talk as roots, we program. And when we talk as roots, we program. And when we talk as roots, we need to talk about our need to talk about our need to talk about our scope. I'm a root. I know where my scope scope. I'm a root. I know where my scope scope. I'm a root. I know where my scope is. is. is. It's not over in It's not over in It's not over in ICS. As a CNAR, the only non-government ICS. As a CNAR, the only non-government ICS. As a CNAR, the only non-government CNR, I'm going we are not balanced in CNR, I'm going we are not balanced in CNR, I'm going we are not balanced in the the the program because this is a global program because this is a global program because this is a global problem and it needs by those of us who problem and it needs by those of us who problem and it needs by those of us who produce software to stand up. We have to be there. up. We have to be there. up. We have to be there. You just can't wait for someone or the You just can't wait for someone or the You just can't wait for someone or the guy to do guy to do guy to do it. It's our it. It's our it. It's our problem. We need to own it. That's why problem. We need to own it. That's why problem. We need to own it. That's why we created CVRF. That's now we created CVRF. That's now we created CVRF. That's now CESAF. It's why we created CESAF. It's why we created CESAF. It's why we created CVSS. It's why they created CVSS. It's why they created CVSS. It's why they created CVE. All these things were created CVE. All these things were created CVE. All these things were created because we had a need. But it shouldn't because we had a need. But it shouldn't because we had a need. But it shouldn't be government explaining that need be government explaining that need be government explaining that need because we have now disconnected where because we have now disconnected where because we have now disconnected where we have EOX, EOL, we have EOX, EOL, we have EOX, EOL, EOS and every C something or other going EOS and every C something or other going EOS and every C something or other going on and we don't know how to map it and on and we don't know how to map it and on and we don't know how to map it and run it. So we scare potential run it. So we scare potential run it. So we scare potential participants in solving these issues. And I'm really harping on this issues. And I'm really harping on this issues. And I'm really harping on this because we can't just recruit CNAs and because we can't just recruit CNAs and because we can't just recruit CNAs and say, "Well, they know how to do some say, "Well, they know how to do some say, "Well, they know how to do some CBD." I can tell you I know a CNA that CBD." I can tell you I know a CNA that CBD." I can tell you I know a CNA that was minted last year who understood was minted last year who understood was minted last year who understood nothing about CBD and killed the nothing about CBD and killed the nothing about CBD and killed the processes. And I know that because I processes. And I know that because I processes. And I know that because I spoke with that CNA a lot. I now meet spoke with that CNA a lot. I now meet spoke with that CNA a lot. I now meet with them with them with them monthly along with a whole lot of other monthly along with a whole lot of other monthly along with a whole lot of other open- source software CNAs because open- source software CNAs because open- source software CNAs because there's a difference in our approach and there's a difference in our approach and there's a difference in our approach and we haven't figured out what that is we haven't figured out what that is we haven't figured out what that is yet. We need to do a better job of yet. We need to do a better job of yet. We need to do a better job of quality so when we provide information quality so when we provide information quality so when we provide information it's it's it's accepted and actioned. To your point, you can issue a To your point, you can issue a To your point, you can issue a patch. I just had a customer come to me patch. I just had a customer come to me patch. I just had a customer come to me and said, "My scanner said, and this is and said, "My scanner said, and this is and said, "My scanner said, and this is a huge problem." They said, "That was a huge problem." They said, "That was a huge problem." They said, "That was fixed in fixed in fixed in 2021. You need to apply 2021. You need to apply 2021. You need to apply it." I don't call it a critical for it." I don't call it a critical for it." I don't call it a critical for nothing. I don't fix it quickly for nothing. I don't fix it quickly for nothing. I don't fix it quickly for nothing. It's a nothing. It's a nothing. It's a risk. Where did that communication break risk. Where did that communication break risk. Where did that communication break down? That's our problem. That's what we That's our problem. That's what we That's our problem. That's what we should be talking to because the should be talking to because the should be talking to because the customer is not customer is not customer is not focused entirely on the risk.

And finally, Omar's going to get there. And finally, Omar's point, I had a boss when I was a point, I had a boss when I was a point, I had a boss when I was a Honeywell said, "Peter, the only time I Honeywell said, "Peter, the only time I Honeywell said, "Peter, the only time I ever see you is bad news. So what is it ever see you is bad news. So what is it ever see you is bad news. So what is it this this this time?" And I thought, "Oh my gosh, she's time?" And I thought, "Oh my gosh, she's time?" And I thought, "Oh my gosh, she's right." right." right." So, two weeks later, I just went over So, two weeks later, I just went over So, two weeks later, I just went over and said, "Hey, Q." "Hi."

In other how many complaints I hear." In other how many complaints I hear." In other words, the more complaints, the more I words, the more complaints, the more I words, the more complaints, the more I was doing my job. And I thought, that's was doing my job. And I thought, that's was doing my job. And I thought, that's a negative way to think of a negative way to think of a negative way to think of us. Think about that. How do you make us. Think about that. How do you make us. Think about that. How do you make yourself positive so when they come in yourself positive so when they come in yourself positive so when they come in they really while you're giving bad news they really while you're giving bad news they really while you're giving bad news see that you're doing the right thing? Thanks for that Pete. I think we're Thanks for that Pete. I think we're Thanks for that Pete.

So uh but just to to kind of hit firm. So uh but just to to kind of hit firm. So uh but just to to kind of hit some points here I think one of the some points here I think one of the some points here I think one of the things that's missing when we so things that's missing when we so things that's missing when we so currently in our curriculum and I'm also currently in our curriculum and I'm also currently in our curriculum and I'm also a tech educator. I teach in at the at a tech educator. I teach in at the at a tech educator. I teach in at the at the college level cyber security we all the college level cyber security we all the college level cyber security we all everybody gets CVEs. CV guys you're everybody gets CVEs. CV guys you're everybody gets CVEs. CV guys you're doing a awesome job. Everybody gets CVs. doing a awesome job. Everybody gets CVs. doing a awesome job. Everybody gets CVs. CV guys. Everybody gets, you know, NVD. CV guys. Everybody gets, you know, NVD. CV guys. Everybody gets, you know, NVD. Speaking of which, Chris Coffin just Speaking of which, Chris Coffin just Speaking of which, Chris Coffin just pops his face into the door as soon as pops his face into the door as soon as pops his face into the door as soon as said that. NVD, it's rocking. Everybody, said that. NVD, it's rocking. Everybody, said that. NVD, it's rocking. Everybody, I mean, everybody does, you know, sees I mean, everybody does, you know, sees I mean, everybody does, you know, sees that. Everybody sees CVSS. All right. that. Everybody sees CVSS. All right. that. Everybody sees CVSS. All right. Um, literally, I mean, you know, we do Um, literally, I mean, you know, we do Um, literally, I mean, you know, we do in our in pretty much any program you in our in pretty much any program you in our in pretty much any program you basically, you know, NVD, CVE, you know, basically, you know, NVD, CVE, you know, basically, you know, NVD, CVE, you know, how you how you triage them, CV, SS. I how you how you triage them, CV, SS. I how you how you triage them, CV, SS. I think one of the things that's missing think one of the things that's missing think one of the things that's missing and you kind of hit on it is when we and you kind of hit on it is when we and you kind of hit on it is when we talk about disclosure, we tend to go talk about disclosure, we tend to go talk about disclosure, we tend to go back and I always demo the uh Cisco back and I always demo the uh Cisco back and I always demo the uh Cisco security site. I always demo the security site. I always demo the security site. I always demo the Microsoft Microsoft Microsoft uh uh security research center. Um I uh uh security research center. Um I uh uh security research center. Um I always look at CISA. I always basically always look at CISA. I always basically always look at CISA. I always basically demo the Kev catalog. Thank you God. Uh demo the Kev catalog. Thank you God. Uh demo the Kev catalog. Thank you God. Uh I mean actually the Kev catalog I mean actually the Kev catalog I mean actually the Kev catalog unfortunately didn't make it into our unfortunately didn't make it into our unfortunately didn't make it into our exam objectives, but I mean it's exam objectives, but I mean it's exam objectives, but I mean it's phenomenal tool. But I think the greater phenomenal tool. But I think the greater phenomenal tool. But I think the greater thing that's missing and the I want to thing that's missing and the I want to thing that's missing and the I want to get with the the CNA coordinators is we get with the the CNA coordinators is we get with the the CNA coordinators is we don't do enough talking about everybody don't do enough talking about everybody don't do enough talking about everybody else. I mean I just to I we do talk else. I mean I just to I we do talk else. I mean I just to I we do talk about uh JPER. I I I only because of about uh JPER. I I I only because of about uh JPER. I I I only because of um uh a tool you used a couple years ago um uh a tool you used a couple years ago um uh a tool you used a couple years ago and you did some phenomenal reporting on and you did some phenomenal reporting on and you did some phenomenal reporting on it. It literally that changed the uh the it. It literally that changed the uh the it. It literally that changed the uh the the platform. We basically all started the platform. We basically all started the platform. We basically all started looking at uh at your work. But we don't looking at uh at your work. But we don't looking at uh at your work. But we don't look at enough CNAs and uh that doesn't look at enough CNAs and uh that doesn't look at enough CNAs and uh that doesn't get in and I think that's I what I'm get in and I think that's I what I'm get in and I think that's I what I'm taking away is that's that's all about taking away is that's that's all about taking away is that's that's all about teaching the next generation about teaching the next generation about teaching the next generation about responsible disclosure and I think responsible disclosure and I think responsible disclosure and I think that's what's missing right my comments that's what's missing right my comments that's what's missing right my comments earlier about bug bounty programs 2025 earlier about bug bounty programs 2025 earlier about bug bounty programs 2025 bug bounty programs because I've been bug bounty programs because I've been bug bounty programs because I've been there I've actually I've had I've there I've actually I've had I've there I've actually I've had I've coached student teams that basically go coached student teams that basically go coached student teams that basically go and do these you know participate in and do these you know participate in and do these you know participate in these bug bounty programs their the these bug bounty programs their the these bug bounty programs their the students expectation is that That's students expectation is that That's students expectation is that That's normal. There's You mean I h responsible normal. There's You mean I h responsible normal. There's You mean I h responsible disclosure without a bounty? You know, disclosure without a bounty? You know, disclosure without a bounty? You know, they kind of like, you know, and I Yeah. they kind of like, you know, and I Yeah. they kind of like, you know, and I Yeah. No, no, that's what we did for years and No, no, that's what we did for years and No, no, that's what we did for years and years before, right? So, um that that's years before, right? So, um that that's years before, right? So, um that that's just my take on the whole thing. I just just my take on the whole thing. I just just my take on the whole thing. I just tremendously I mean I just sitting here tremendously I mean I just sitting here tremendously I mean I just sitting here I just soaked up a whole lot in terms of I just soaked up a whole lot in terms of I just soaked up a whole lot in terms of this uh uh but I mean I just wanted to this uh uh but I mean I just wanted to this uh uh but I mean I just wanted to kind of throw that out there in terms of kind of throw that out there in terms of kind of throw that out there in terms of I think areas where you're hitting I think areas where you're hitting I think areas where you're hitting really strong and areas where we need to really strong and areas where we need to really strong and areas where we need to do more work. Thank you. Those are super do more work. Thank you. Those are super do more work. Thank you. Those are super great points. We'd love to connect with great points. We'd love to connect with great points. We'd love to connect with you from the teaching perspective on, you from the teaching perspective on, you from the teaching perspective on, you know, our efforts to upskill current you know, our efforts to upskill current you know, our efforts to upskill current CNAs and just how we recruit quality CNAs and just how we recruit quality CNAs and just how we recruit quality ones. So, that's super great. And we'd ones. So, that's super great. And we'd ones. So, that's super great. And we'd love a good certification on all of this love a good certification on all of this love a good certification on all of this stuff. I've got the security plus, but I stuff. I've got the security plus, but I stuff. I've got the security plus, but I don't think there's one that's like don't think there's one that's like don't think there's one that's like super akin to this line of work. M yeah I just want to say that all the yeah I just want to say that all the yeah I just want to say that all the information was insightful I'll uh bring information was insightful I'll uh bring information was insightful I'll uh bring back to my group and um definitely use back to my group and um definitely use back to my group and um definitely use the information and um you know from uh the information and um you know from uh the information and um you know from uh quality of everything to coordinators to quality of everything to coordinators to quality of everything to coordinators to uh you know information being not uh you know information being not uh you know information being not reached to the people who need to know reached to the people who need to know reached to the people who need to know or people who need to engage not being or people who need to engage not being or people who need to engage not being engaged. I would frame it as you know engaged. I would frame it as you know engaged. I would frame it as you know lack of coordination in every part of lack of coordination in every part of lack of coordination in every part of ecosystem. So if any anyone has thoughts ecosystem. So if any anyone has thoughts ecosystem.
