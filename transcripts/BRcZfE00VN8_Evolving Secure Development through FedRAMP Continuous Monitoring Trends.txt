Thanks for coming to listen to us talk about uh FedRamp continuous to us talk about uh FedRamp continuous to us talk about uh FedRamp continuous monitoring trends and how we're trying monitoring trends and how we're trying monitoring trends and how we're trying to use those to uh improve secure to use those to uh improve secure to use those to uh improve secure development at Red Hat. Uh so my name is development at Red Hat. Uh so my name is development at Red Hat. Uh so my name is Stephanie Harris. I am a principal Stephanie Harris. I am a principal Stephanie Harris. I am a principal product security engineer for the uh product security engineer for the uh product security engineer for the uh product security compliance team at Red product security compliance team at Red product security compliance team at Red Hat. I've been here about three years, a Hat. I've been here about three years, a Hat. I've been here about three years, a little over three years. And for that little over three years. And for that little over three years. And for that time, I've been the information system time, I've been the information system time, I've been the information system security manager ISSM for our Fed ramp security manager ISSM for our Fed ramp security manager ISSM for our Fed ramp uh program. Um I'll pass it over to my uh program. Um I'll pass it over to my uh program. Um I'll pass it over to my colleague. Hello everyone. Uh my name is colleague. Hello everyone. Uh my name is colleague. Hello everyone. Uh my name is Christopher Lusk. I'm also a principal Christopher Lusk. I'm also a principal Christopher Lusk. I'm also a principal product security uh engineer at Red Hat product security uh engineer at Red Hat product security uh engineer at Red Hat and I've been with the company about two and I've been with the company about two and I've been with the company about two and a half years. And uh my whole time and a half years. And uh my whole time and a half years. And uh my whole time there I've been primarily Fed Ramp. I've there I've been primarily Fed Ramp. I've there I've been primarily Fed Ramp. I've also done vulnerability management uh to also done vulnerability management uh to also done vulnerability management uh to support other initiatives like uh support other initiatives like uh support other initiatives like uh PCIDSS, SOCK 2 and PCIDSS, SOCK 2 and PCIDSS, SOCK 2 and ISO. ISO. ISO. Awesome. So, today we're going to Awesome. So, today we're going to Awesome. So, today we're going to discuss a few different topics. Uh we're discuss a few different topics. Uh we're discuss a few different topics. Uh we're going to give a little bit of an going to give a little bit of an going to give a little bit of an overview of uh Fed Ramp and continuous overview of uh Fed Ramp and continuous overview of uh Fed Ramp and continuous monitoring because we're just going to monitoring because we're just going to monitoring because we're just going to assume that there are going to be some assume that there are going to be some assume that there are going to be some people in here that don't know much people in here that don't know much people in here that don't know much about those. Maybe you heard the about those. Maybe you heard the about those. Maybe you heard the acronym, but not much else. Uh we're acronym, but not much else. Uh we're acronym, but not much else. Uh we're going to talk about some challenges that going to talk about some challenges that going to talk about some challenges that we've run into uh while doing Fed Ramp we've run into uh while doing Fed Ramp we've run into uh while doing Fed Ramp and while trying to find uh trends and and while trying to find uh trends and and while trying to find uh trends and suggestions for um you know, the suggestions for um you know, the suggestions for um you know, the security development that we're talking security development that we're talking security development that we're talking about today. Uh we're also uh going to about today. Uh we're also uh going to about today. Uh we're also uh going to talk about Fed ramp impacts on talk about Fed ramp impacts on talk about Fed ramp impacts on organizations in general but organizations in general but organizations in general but specifically talking about our specifically talking about our specifically talking about our experience at Red Hat. Some suggestions experience at Red Hat. Some suggestions experience at Red Hat. Some suggestions moving forward about secure development moving forward about secure development moving forward about secure development and then you know what's next? Awesome. So Fed Ramp and next? Awesome. So Fed Ramp and next? Awesome. So Fed Ramp and continuous monitoring what is it? What continuous monitoring what is it? What continuous monitoring what is it? What are those? So Fed Ramp stands for are those? So Fed Ramp stands for are those? So Fed Ramp stands for federal risk and authorization federal risk and authorization federal risk and authorization management program. uh federal agencies management program. uh federal agencies management program. uh federal agencies in general have to follow a lot of laws, in general have to follow a lot of laws, in general have to follow a lot of laws, regulations, tons of policies. A big one regulations, tons of policies. A big one regulations, tons of policies. A big one that a lot of people look back on is uh that a lot of people look back on is uh that a lot of people look back on is uh Federal Information Security Management Federal Information Security Management Federal Information Security Management Act or FISMA. uh the security uh that Act or FISMA. uh the security uh that Act or FISMA. uh the security uh that law came into effect and law came into effect and law came into effect and uh put some requirements or not uh put some requirements or not uh put some requirements or not requirements but responsibility on NIS requirements but responsibility on NIS requirements but responsibility on NIS to create special publications to try to to create special publications to try to to create special publications to try to help agencies help agencies help agencies uh you know meet the requirements of uh you know meet the requirements of uh you know meet the requirements of FISMA and the other laws that are out FISMA and the other laws that are out FISMA and the other laws that are out there. So there's tons and tons of there. So there's tons and tons of there. So there's tons and tons of special publications. The main one that special publications. The main one that special publications. The main one that we use for Fed Ramp is 853. So it's a we use for Fed Ramp is 853. So it's a we use for Fed Ramp is 853. So it's a big huge list of controls that you can big huge list of controls that you can big huge list of controls that you can put in place for your information put in place for your information put in place for your information systems. So Fed Ramp was basically um systems. So Fed Ramp was basically um systems. So Fed Ramp was basically um created to kind of help agencies adopt created to kind of help agencies adopt created to kind of help agencies adopt cloud-based services cloud-based services cloud-based services um just giving them guidance on you know um just giving them guidance on you know um just giving them guidance on you know what they can use and uh to give private what they can use and uh to give private what they can use and uh to give private sector uh cloud service providers or sector uh cloud service providers or sector uh cloud service providers or CSPs guidance as well on how to meet CSPs guidance as well on how to meet CSPs guidance as well on how to meet those requirements so they can actually those requirements so they can actually those requirements so they can actually service the government agencies. service the government agencies. service the government agencies. Uh so in a very very abbreviated Uh so in a very very abbreviated Uh so in a very very abbreviated uh process uh this is how Fed Ramp goes. uh process uh this is how Fed Ramp goes. uh process uh this is how Fed Ramp goes. So a CSP decide decides that they want So a CSP decide decides that they want So a CSP decide decides that they want to go down the Fed ramp path. They want to go down the Fed ramp path. They want to go down the Fed ramp path. They want to be able to provide their offerings to to be able to provide their offerings to to be able to provide their offerings to agencies. So they go out and get an agencies. So they go out and get an agencies. So they go out and get an agency sponsor and the first thing they agency sponsor and the first thing they agency sponsor and the first thing they do is a kickoff. So you meet with your do is a kickoff. So you meet with your do is a kickoff. So you meet with your agency sponsor, you meet with the Fed agency sponsor, you meet with the Fed agency sponsor, you meet with the Fed Ramp program management office Ramp program management office Ramp program management office representatives, the PMO and uh then you representatives, the PMO and uh then you representatives, the PMO and uh then you start your process. So this is like I start your process. So this is like I start your process. So this is like I said very abbreviated. So once you do said very abbreviated. So once you do said very abbreviated. So once you do your kickoff, you start getting into your kickoff, you start getting into your kickoff, you start getting into your assessment. So you can do a your assessment. So you can do a your assessment. So you can do a readiness assessment if you want to to readiness assessment if you want to to readiness assessment if you want to to show that you actually can meet the show that you actually can meet the show that you actually can meet the requirements or you're pretty close to requirements or you're pretty close to requirements or you're pretty close to it. Once you do that, if you decide to it. Once you do that, if you decide to it. Once you do that, if you decide to do it, then after you finish that, you do it, then after you finish that, you do it, then after you finish that, you go into a security assessment. So these go into a security assessment. So these go into a security assessment. So these are like three to four monthlong uh are like three to four monthlong uh are like three to four monthlong uh month-long assessments that you do with month-long assessments that you do with month-long assessments that you do with a third-party um assessment organization a third-party um assessment organization a third-party um assessment organization or 3P 3PAO. or 3P 3PAO. or 3P 3PAO. Uh, so after you go through those Uh, so after you go through those Uh, so after you go through those assessments, you do a bunch of testing assessments, you do a bunch of testing assessments, you do a bunch of testing like, sorry, I keep breathing into this. like, sorry, I keep breathing into this. like, sorry, I keep breathing into this. Um, you you do scans, you do pen Um, you you do scans, you do pen Um, you you do scans, you do pen testing, you do manual interviews with testing, you do manual interviews with testing, you do manual interviews with them, and once you finish these big them, and once you finish these big them, and once you finish these big reports come out, they're given to your reports come out, they're given to your reports come out, they're given to your agency. Your agency reviews them. After agency. Your agency reviews them. After agency. Your agency reviews them. After a couple months, they're going to say a couple months, they're going to say a couple months, they're going to say they're good with them, and they're they're good with them, and they're they're good with them, and they're going to give you an ATO, which is a going to give you an ATO, which is a going to give you an ATO, which is a authorization to operate. But after authorization to operate. But after authorization to operate. But after that, you still have to give it to the that, you still have to give it to the that, you still have to give it to the Fed Ramp PMO and they're going to do Fed Ramp PMO and they're going to do Fed Ramp PMO and they're going to do their review. So for us, we started ours their review. So for us, we started ours their review. So for us, we started ours in oh like April of 2022. We got our ATO in oh like April of 2022. We got our ATO in oh like April of 2022. We got our ATO in December of 2022. So it took several in December of 2022. So it took several in December of 2022. So it took several months to go through that process and months to go through that process and months to go through that process and then we were put in key with the PMO. We then we were put in key with the PMO. We then we were put in key with the PMO. We had to wait like six months in order to had to wait like six months in order to had to wait like six months in order to be approved by them and put on the be approved by them and put on the be approved by them and put on the marketplace. So we did that. We got on marketplace. So we did that. We got on marketplace. So we did that. We got on the marketplace. We got our atto from the marketplace. We got our atto from the marketplace. We got our atto from our agency sponsor and we're done. We our agency sponsor and we're done. We our agency sponsor and we're done. We made it. We were accepted. We were put made it. We were accepted. We were put made it. We were accepted. We were put on the marketplace. We're completely on the marketplace. We're completely on the marketplace. We're completely done. High five. done. High five. done. High five. Psych. Yeah, just kidding. You're not Psych. Yeah, just kidding. You're not Psych. Yeah, just kidding. You're not done. You're never done. Feder is never done. You're never done. Feder is never done. You're never done. Feder is never over. So once you get your over. So once you get your over. So once you get your authorization, you go through this authorization, you go through this authorization, you go through this process or get into this process called process or get into this process called process or get into this process called continuous monitoring. So there's tons continuous monitoring. So there's tons continuous monitoring. So there's tons of tasks that you have to do on a of tasks that you have to do on a of tasks that you have to do on a regular basis. Some of them are regular basis. Some of them are regular basis. Some of them are constantly, some of them can be annually constantly, some of them can be annually constantly, some of them can be annually depending on what categorization level depending on what categorization level depending on what categorization level that you that you choose for your system that you that you choose for your system that you that you choose for your system like what you determine the data levels like what you determine the data levels like what you determine the data levels at. So it could be fed ramp low, fed at. So it could be fed ramp low, fed at. So it could be fed ramp low, fed ramp moderate, fed ramp high. So we're ramp moderate, fed ramp high. So we're ramp moderate, fed ramp high. So we're fed ramp high and that means that at the fed ramp high and that means that at the fed ramp high and that means that at the worst case we're doing stuff annually worst case we're doing stuff annually worst case we're doing stuff annually but down to constantly. So, some of but down to constantly. So, some of but down to constantly. So, some of these you can see on our ah scared face, these you can see on our ah scared face, these you can see on our ah scared face, whatever, shocked face, there's whatever, shocked face, there's whatever, shocked face, there's um pulling inventory. You have to pull um pulling inventory. You have to pull um pulling inventory. You have to pull that, review it, pull user access. Um that, review it, pull user access. Um that, review it, pull user access. Um make sure that you're still working with make sure that you're still working with make sure that you're still working with lease uh lease privilege people that lease uh lease privilege people that lease uh lease privilege people that have access are supposed to continue to have access are supposed to continue to have access are supposed to continue to have access. Uh you have to look at have access. Uh you have to look at have access. Uh you have to look at change management. If there's any kind change management. If there's any kind change management. If there's any kind of changes that are above what basic of changes that are above what basic of changes that are above what basic maintenance is, you have to go through maintenance is, you have to go through maintenance is, you have to go through and review it. figure out if it's a and review it. figure out if it's a and review it. figure out if it's a significant change. If it is, then you significant change. If it is, then you significant change. If it is, then you have to go through another assessment have to go through another assessment have to go through another assessment for that, which we've done several of for that, which we've done several of for that, which we've done several of those. those. those. Um, ports, protocols, services, looking Um, ports, protocols, services, looking Um, ports, protocols, services, looking for lease functionality. There's there's for lease functionality. There's there's for lease functionality. There's there's tons of different aspects of continuous tons of different aspects of continuous tons of different aspects of continuous monitoring. But for us, our opinion that monitoring. But for us, our opinion that monitoring. But for us, our opinion that the most uh like resource consuming, the most uh like resource consuming, the most uh like resource consuming, time conssuming aspect is scans. scans. time conssuming aspect is scans. scans. time conssuming aspect is scans. scans. So, scans and vulnerability management. So, scans and vulnerability management. So, scans and vulnerability management. Um, so I'll I'll hand it over to Chris Um, so I'll I'll hand it over to Chris Um, so I'll I'll hand it over to Chris to talk about scans. Yeah. So, everyone to talk about scans. Yeah. So, everyone to talk about scans. Yeah. So, everyone loves scans. I feel like this picture loves scans. I feel like this picture loves scans. I feel like this picture probably captures scanning for most probably captures scanning for most probably captures scanning for most people. But within Fed Ramp, uh, you people. But within Fed Ramp, uh, you people. But within Fed Ramp, uh, you obviously have vulnerability scanning, obviously have vulnerability scanning, obviously have vulnerability scanning, which is what most people think of, but which is what most people think of, but which is what most people think of, but you also have um, configuration you also have um, configuration you also have um, configuration scanning, which uh, CIS benchmarks, STS, scanning, which uh, CIS benchmarks, STS, scanning, which uh, CIS benchmarks, STS, DSA, things of that nature. So, you're DSA, things of that nature. So, you're DSA, things of that nature. So, you're constantly having to scan monthtomonth, constantly having to scan monthtomonth, constantly having to scan monthtomonth, attest to those. It's just a constant attest to those. It's just a constant attest to those. It's just a constant cycle. So part of the the situation um as far So part of the the situation um as far So part of the the situation um as far as why we did this. So we were about two as why we did this. So we were about two as why we did this. So we were about two years into continuous monitoring um and years into continuous monitoring um and years into continuous monitoring um and we ran into some issues. So we were in a we ran into some issues. So we were in a we ran into some issues. So we were in a situation where we had seen our our situation where we had seen our our situation where we had seen our our scope triple in size. Um we were very scope triple in size. Um we were very scope triple in size. Um we were very reliant on manual processes that didn't reliant on manual processes that didn't reliant on manual processes that didn't scale as we add new services and scale as we add new services and scale as we add new services and products within FedRamp or plan to. Um products within FedRamp or plan to. Um products within FedRamp or plan to. Um we also saw an increase in CVEEs. um at we also saw an increase in CVEEs. um at we also saw an increase in CVEEs. um at some points uh throughout the year we some points uh throughout the year we some points uh throughout the year we had hundreds uh and then we were also had hundreds uh and then we were also had hundreds uh and then we were also limited in our engineering resources and limited in our engineering resources and limited in our engineering resources and I think everyone knows here who who deal I think everyone knows here who who deal I think everyone knows here who who deal excuse me deals with remediations know excuse me deals with remediations know excuse me deals with remediations know that you can't fix everything um and that you can't fix everything um and that you can't fix everything um and maybe you shouldn't but uh obviously you maybe you shouldn't but uh obviously you maybe you shouldn't but uh obviously you have to prioritize what's relevant to have to prioritize what's relevant to have to prioritize what's relevant to your environment and what's a actual your environment and what's a actual your environment and what's a actual threat and then also uh questionable threat and then also uh questionable threat and then also uh questionable image hygiene we had teams uh putting image hygiene we had teams uh putting image hygiene we had teams uh putting images in boundary that had u you know images in boundary that had u you know images in boundary that had u you know hundreds of CVE so there was issues hundreds of CVE so there was issues hundreds of CVE so there was issues there so uh with those things in mind, there so uh with those things in mind, there so uh with those things in mind, we wanted to look at look into the we wanted to look at look into the we wanted to look at look into the numbers and see if we could spot some numbers and see if we could spot some numbers and see if we could spot some trends and see if we could uh prevent trends and see if we could uh prevent trends and see if we could uh prevent some of these from coming into the some of these from coming into the some of these from coming into the environment or even appearing on scans environment or even appearing on scans environment or even appearing on scans uh in the first place. So these are some of the ch the place. So these are some of the ch the place. So these are some of the ch the other challenges that we had other challenges that we had other challenges that we had um and they fall into three categories. um and they fall into three categories. um and they fall into three categories. So the first would be um overall So the first would be um overall So the first would be um overall continuous monitoring. So when we first continuous monitoring. So when we first continuous monitoring. So when we first started doing continuous monitoring in started doing continuous monitoring in started doing continuous monitoring in January 20 2023, we really had to build January 20 2023, we really had to build January 20 2023, we really had to build a whole program uh from the ground up a whole program uh from the ground up a whole program uh from the ground up with this and again we we reliant on with this and again we we reliant on with this and again we we reliant on largely manual processes that scale. Um largely manual processes that scale. Um largely manual processes that scale. Um unfortunately a lot of our work was unfortunately a lot of our work was unfortunately a lot of our work was within spreadsheets. Um as much as I within spreadsheets. Um as much as I within spreadsheets. Um as much as I love those, we also found ourselves in a love those, we also found ourselves in a love those, we also found ourselves in a situation where we uh within Red Hat we situation where we uh within Red Hat we situation where we uh within Red Hat we were evangelizing Fed ramp. uh we were were evangelizing Fed ramp. uh we were were evangelizing Fed ramp. uh we were going to teams asking them to fix things going to teams asking them to fix things going to teams asking them to fix things and they had no idea what Fed ramp was and they had no idea what Fed ramp was and they had no idea what Fed ramp was and why we were asking them to to meet and why we were asking them to to meet and why we were asking them to to meet these uh these timelines for these uh these timelines for these uh these timelines for remediation. And then also um the other remediation. And then also um the other remediation. And then also um the other thing too, if you have tooling, you're thing too, if you have tooling, you're thing too, if you have tooling, you're looking to add new tooling to within looking to add new tooling to within looking to add new tooling to within your environment, there's a certain your environment, there's a certain your environment, there's a certain process that you have to follow. Um you process that you have to follow. Um you process that you have to follow. Um you can't just, you know, have a tool or can't just, you know, have a tool or can't just, you know, have a tool or bring a tool in. It has to go through an bring a tool in. It has to go through an bring a tool in. It has to go through an assessment. It has to be evaluated and assessment. It has to be evaluated and assessment. It has to be evaluated and then approved. then approved. then approved. Yeah. And so the next one, so that was Yeah. And so the next one, so that was Yeah. And so the next one, so that was kind of like overall issues or you know kind of like overall issues or you know kind of like overall issues or you know challenges that we ran across with Fed challenges that we ran across with Fed challenges that we ran across with Fed Ramp in general moving into continuous Ramp in general moving into continuous Ramp in general moving into continuous monitoring. But when we started seeing monitoring. But when we started seeing monitoring. But when we started seeing the the images the the images the the images um come in that had way more um come in that had way more um come in that had way more vulnerabilities than the norm like when vulnerabilities than the norm like when vulnerabilities than the norm like when we had a smaller platform we had an we had a smaller platform we had an we had a smaller platform we had an average of maybe like 20 to 30 average of maybe like 20 to 30 average of maybe like 20 to 30 vulnerabilities coming in as we would vulnerabilities coming in as we would vulnerabilities coming in as we would remediate other things. It's totally remediate other things. It's totally remediate other things. It's totally expected when we moved up and our expected when we moved up and our expected when we moved up and our um and our platform kind of tripled in um and our platform kind of tripled in um and our platform kind of tripled in size as we brought in new services and size as we brought in new services and size as we brought in new services and such. It moved up to being an average of such. It moved up to being an average of such. It moved up to being an average of like 70 to 80. But then we would see like 70 to 80. But then we would see like 70 to 80. But then we would see instances where the like like Chris instances where the like like Chris instances where the like like Chris said, hundreds like three to 400 just said, hundreds like three to 400 just said, hundreds like three to 400 just randomly popping up. So we didn't want randomly popping up. So we didn't want randomly popping up. So we didn't want to ignore it obviously because it was to ignore it obviously because it was to ignore it obviously because it was out of the norm and we also didn't want out of the norm and we also didn't want out of the norm and we also didn't want to just jump the gun. So I started to just jump the gun. So I started to just jump the gun. So I started reaching out and researching with the reaching out and researching with the reaching out and researching with the engineers, you know, like what what was engineers, you know, like what what was engineers, you know, like what what was the situation that led to this. We kind the situation that led to this. We kind the situation that led to this. We kind of had to do an afteraction report of had to do an afteraction report of had to do an afteraction report because it was pretty excessive for what because it was pretty excessive for what because it was pretty excessive for what we were used to. Um so this this bullet we were used to. Um so this this bullet we were used to. Um so this this bullet here, finding image health solutions, here, finding image health solutions, here, finding image health solutions, the reason why I put that on there as a the reason why I put that on there as a the reason why I put that on there as a challenge was in meeting with different challenge was in meeting with different challenge was in meeting with different engineers, the the challenges of using engineers, the the challenges of using engineers, the the challenges of using healthy images, it was multifaceted. You healthy images, it was multifaceted. You healthy images, it was multifaceted. You know, some of them they weren't using know, some of them they weren't using know, some of them they weren't using old images. They were using the most old images. They were using the most old images. They were using the most recent. Most recent being like within a recent. Most recent being like within a recent. Most recent being like within a month, but looking at some teams repos month, but looking at some teams repos month, but looking at some teams repos going back a year, they just had an going back a year, they just had an going back a year, they just had an overall pretty poor health grade because overall pretty poor health grade because overall pretty poor health grade because uh our images are all stored in a in a uh our images are all stored in a in a uh our images are all stored in a in a solution that we have a repository solution that we have a repository solution that we have a repository called Quay. And uh before something's called Quay. And uh before something's called Quay. And uh before something's pulled into our boundary, it goes pulled into our boundary, it goes pulled into our boundary, it goes through the CLA scanner and it gives a a through the CLA scanner and it gives a a through the CLA scanner and it gives a a health index on what these images look health index on what these images look health index on what these images look like. Um so you can see the grade right like. Um so you can see the grade right like. Um so you can see the grade right there. Sometimes it's not one of the there. Sometimes it's not one of the there. Sometimes it's not one of the challenges from one of the engineers was challenges from one of the engineers was challenges from one of the engineers was sometimes we don't get those grades sometimes we don't get those grades sometimes we don't get those grades right away. Sometimes there's a there's right away. Sometimes there's a there's right away. Sometimes there's a there's a delay. a delay. a delay. Um and uh I was, you know, I asked about Um and uh I was, you know, I asked about Um and uh I was, you know, I asked about blockers. How can we block based on this blockers. How can we block based on this blockers. How can we block based on this grade? Maybe we should require a B and grade? Maybe we should require a B and grade? Maybe we should require a B and above. And uh I was, you know, given above. And uh I was, you know, given above. And uh I was, you know, given the the response basically that um you the the response basically that um you the the response basically that um you know it could it could cause problems know it could it could cause problems know it could it could cause problems operationally if we were to start operationally if we were to start operationally if we were to start blocking images that maybe started off blocking images that maybe started off blocking images that maybe started off with one grade and then you know with one grade and then you know with one grade and then you know unknowingly something came out or a CVE unknowingly something came out or a CVE unknowingly something came out or a CVE was reclassified and it became you know was reclassified and it became you know was reclassified and it became you know more severe it could it could cause more severe it could it could cause more severe it could it could cause problems. So so those are some of the problems. So so those are some of the problems. So so those are some of the things that that I got when I went things that that I got when I went things that that I got when I went through and tried to research. And uh through and tried to research. And uh through and tried to research. And uh then the last one I can't see it uh then the last one I can't see it uh then the last one I can't see it uh analyzing vulnerability trends. Okay. So analyzing vulnerability trends. Okay. So analyzing vulnerability trends. Okay. So we had all this data and Fed ramp high we had all this data and Fed ramp high we had all this data and Fed ramp high is a is a an isolated not airgapped but is a is a an isolated not airgapped but is a is a an isolated not airgapped but isolated platform. It's not in our isolated platform. It's not in our isolated platform. It's not in our commercial commercial commercial environment. So that means that any of environment. So that means that any of environment. So that means that any of the trends we have we have to the trends we have we have to the trends we have we have to um um um word we have to uh you know remove some word we have to uh you know remove some word we have to uh you know remove some of the data. we have to remove some of of the data. we have to remove some of of the data. we have to remove some of the data before we can put it into the data before we can put it into the data before we can put it into anything to try to analyze it. So using anything to try to analyze it. So using anything to try to analyze it. So using parts of scans instead of just having a parts of scans instead of just having a parts of scans instead of just having a scanner attached to something that can scanner attached to something that can scanner attached to something that can give you an overall health and and um give you an overall health and and um give you an overall health and and um metrics related to it. It it's pretty metrics related to it. It it's pretty metrics related to it. It it's pretty difficult. So we had a we we used a lot difficult. So we had a we we used a lot difficult. So we had a we we used a lot of spreadsheets. It was a lot of fun, of spreadsheets. It was a lot of fun, of spreadsheets. It was a lot of fun, but we found some great metrics. So but we found some great metrics. So but we found some great metrics. So those were, you know, like pretty much those were, you know, like pretty much those were, you know, like pretty much the the challenges that we ran the the challenges that we ran the the challenges that we ran into, like I said, with with going into into, like I said, with with going into into, like I said, with with going into continuous monitoring and then trying to continuous monitoring and then trying to continuous monitoring and then trying to find solutions to hand off to other find solutions to hand off to other find solutions to hand off to other people to say, "Hey, you know, we think people to say, "Hey, you know, we think people to say, "Hey, you know, we think that these might help us have better that these might help us have better that these might help us have better container health uh moving forward. So now on to the uh the vulnerability So now on to the uh the vulnerability So now on to the uh the vulnerability trends that we trends that we trends that we saw. Yeah. So again, this was captured saw. Yeah. So again, this was captured saw. Yeah. So again, this was captured from our first month in continuous from our first month in continuous from our first month in continuous monitoring in January 2023 up until monitoring in January 2023 up until monitoring in January 2023 up until January of this year. So we saw a total January of this year. So we saw a total January of this year. So we saw a total of uh 1,500 CBEEs and that was across of uh 1,500 CBEEs and that was across of uh 1,500 CBEEs and that was across 220 components and then we did exclude 220 components and then we did exclude 220 components and then we did exclude uh the kernel vulnerabilities that were uh the kernel vulnerabilities that were uh the kernel vulnerabilities that were dropped last year. I think there were dropped last year. I think there were dropped last year. I think there were 673 in total. 673 in total. 673 in total. Yeah. So obviously that would have Yeah. So obviously that would have Yeah. So obviously that would have skewed the data a little bit. Not that skewed the data a little bit. Not that skewed the data a little bit. Not that those aren't relevant, but we wanted to those aren't relevant, but we wanted to those aren't relevant, but we wanted to look at those outside of the the kernel look at those outside of the the kernel look at those outside of the the kernel issues. Um so from this data we came up issues. Um so from this data we came up issues. Um so from this data we came up with three categories or three top 10 with three categories or three top 10 with three categories or three top 10 lists because everyone loves a top 10 lists because everyone loves a top 10 lists because everyone loves a top 10 list. So first we we identified the top list. So first we we identified the top list. So first we we identified the top 10 most commonly affected components. Um 10 most commonly affected components. Um 10 most commonly affected components. Um from there we tried to identify the top from there we tried to identify the top from there we tried to identify the top 10 most common CWES and then last uh we 10 most common CWES and then last uh we 10 most common CWES and then last uh we identified the top 10 most common CWES identified the top 10 most common CWES identified the top 10 most common CWES that end up on our POM. So POM is that end up on our POM. So POM is that end up on our POM. So POM is essentially Feder acronym. It's for plan essentially Feder acronym. It's for plan essentially Feder acronym. It's for plan of action and milestones and essentially of action and milestones and essentially of action and milestones and essentially um it's a process. as as a a document um it's a process. as as a a document um it's a process. as as a a document when you have something that goes past when you have something that goes past when you have something that goes past its uh remediation deadline. So, you're its uh remediation deadline. So, you're its uh remediation deadline. So, you're basically overdue and uh you know, it's basically overdue and uh you know, it's basically overdue and uh you know, it's it's just things that aren't getting it's just things that aren't getting it's just things that aren't getting fixed in time with based on the severity fixed in time with based on the severity fixed in time with based on the severity level. So, looking at the components, I level. So, looking at the components, I level. So, looking at the components, I I won't read each one of these off to I won't read each one of these off to I won't read each one of these off to you, but you could see here um these all you, but you could see here um these all you, but you could see here um these all accounted for I think about 42% of all accounted for I think about 42% of all accounted for I think about 42% of all the CBEEs in the environment from that the CBEEs in the environment from that the CBEEs in the environment from that in that 2-year period. um from the ones in that 2-year period. um from the ones in that 2-year period. um from the ones that you see here and maybe at a more that you see here and maybe at a more that you see here and maybe at a more useful level we put these into useful level we put these into useful level we put these into categories. So you can see here uh categories. So you can see here uh categories. So you can see here uh programming languages that cut the the programming languages that cut the the programming languages that cut the the uh fond off on me but it's uh over 50 uh fond off on me but it's uh over 50 uh fond off on me but it's uh over 50 excuse me 53% as you can see and then excuse me 53% as you can see and then excuse me 53% as you can see and then next was CLI tools which was 30 uh next was CLI tools which was 30 uh next was CLI tools which was 30 uh libraries were at 10 and then libraries were at 10 and then libraries were at 10 and then cryptographic modules basically open SSL cryptographic modules basically open SSL cryptographic modules basically open SSL was uh right at 5.9%. So the next uh top 10 list that we came So the next uh top 10 list that we came So the next uh top 10 list that we came up with was the C.WE's that were up with was the C.WE's that were up with was the C.WE's that were relating to the vulnerabilities that we relating to the vulnerabilities that we relating to the vulnerabilities that we found. Um so we tried to line these up. found. Um so we tried to line these up. found. Um so we tried to line these up. So basically all of this stemmed from So basically all of this stemmed from So basically all of this stemmed from like a paper that I wrote to try to give like a paper that I wrote to try to give like a paper that I wrote to try to give a proposal a proposal a proposal and it's easy to give suggestions all and it's easy to give suggestions all and it's easy to give suggestions all day long you know making a guess or an day long you know making a guess or an day long you know making a guess or an assumption but we wanted to go back and assumption but we wanted to go back and assumption but we wanted to go back and look at the actual numbers and see you look at the actual numbers and see you look at the actual numbers and see you know like what what does this the actual know like what what does this the actual know like what what does this the actual data not just numbers what does this data not just numbers what does this data not just numbers what does this line up to what kind of um what what line up to what kind of um what what line up to what kind of um what what category of weaknesses are lining up category of weaknesses are lining up category of weaknesses are lining up with those vulnerabilities that are with those vulnerabilities that are with those vulnerabilities that are showing up in our environment showing up in our environment showing up in our environment environment. So you'll see the list here environment. So you'll see the list here environment. So you'll see the list here and again I'm not going to read through and again I'm not going to read through and again I'm not going to read through all of them. They're there and we're all of them. They're there and we're all of them. They're there and we're going to share the slides after the fact going to share the slides after the fact going to share the slides after the fact but um just looking through uh a lot of but um just looking through uh a lot of but um just looking through uh a lot of them are related to like memory based them are related to like memory based them are related to like memory based weaknesses. Uh and a lot of stuff like weaknesses. Uh and a lot of stuff like weaknesses. Uh and a lot of stuff like this can be mitigated through uh secure this can be mitigated through uh secure this can be mitigated through uh secure development practices making sure that development practices making sure that development practices making sure that the testing is being looked at um and the testing is being looked at um and the testing is being looked at um and those items being remediated. And those items being remediated. And those items being remediated. And there's been a lot of Red Hat talks this there's been a lot of Red Hat talks this there's been a lot of Red Hat talks this week. And this is something that across week. And this is something that across week. And this is something that across the different teams, we're all looking the different teams, we're all looking the different teams, we're all looking at this to try to figure out how to do at this to try to figure out how to do at this to try to figure out how to do things a little bit better. So there's things a little bit better. So there's things a little bit better. So there's tons that we're making a few different tons that we're making a few different tons that we're making a few different tools. We're looking at different tools. We're looking at different tools. We're looking at different aspects trying to figure out how to make aspects trying to figure out how to make aspects trying to figure out how to make this a little bit better. But this a little bit better. But this a little bit better. But um uh yeah, um uh yeah, um uh yeah, so like I said, a lot of these were uh so like I said, a lot of these were uh so like I said, a lot of these were uh memory based uh weaknesses. Some of the memory based uh weaknesses. Some of the memory based uh weaknesses. Some of the categories on here are listed on the categories on here are listed on the categories on here are listed on the MITER site as you uh their class level MITER site as you uh their class level MITER site as you uh their class level CWES and it's discouraged to map them CWES and it's discouraged to map them CWES and it's discouraged to map them because it's easy to um provide because it's easy to um provide because it's easy to um provide misleading or false information. So, we misleading or false information. So, we misleading or false information. So, we included them because they were in our included them because they were in our included them because they were in our top 10 with the full like knowledge that top 10 with the full like knowledge that top 10 with the full like knowledge that later on we're going to have to dive later on we're going to have to dive later on we're going to have to dive deeper and figure out what exactly those deeper and figure out what exactly those deeper and figure out what exactly those categories uh those CVEEs um were categories uh those CVEEs um were categories uh those CVEEs um were related to for you know actionable data. So, data. So, data. So, yeah, excuse me. I think no surprise uh yeah, excuse me. I think no surprise uh yeah, excuse me. I think no surprise uh the top 10 CWs for the poem were all the top 10 CWs for the poem were all the top 10 CWs for the poem were all ones that were on the top 10 more ones that were on the top 10 more ones that were on the top 10 more broadly. they were just in uh varying broadly. they were just in uh varying broadly. they were just in uh varying orders. So again, these were ones um you orders. So again, these were ones um you orders. So again, these were ones um you know that are passed due um that have know that are passed due um that have know that are passed due um that have gone past the remediation deadline. So gone past the remediation deadline. So gone past the remediation deadline. So it's kind of redundant from the the it's kind of redundant from the the it's kind of redundant from the the previous data. So now we're going to talk about data. So now we're going to talk about data. So now we're going to talk about um some of the impacts of Fed Ramp um some of the impacts of Fed Ramp um some of the impacts of Fed Ramp indirectly on Red Hat just by doing Fed indirectly on Red Hat just by doing Fed indirectly on Red Hat just by doing Fed Ramp. Um so first off uh one of the the Ramp. Um so first off uh one of the the Ramp. Um so first off uh one of the the biggest things that I've seen um has biggest things that I've seen um has biggest things that I've seen um has been improvements on our public facing been improvements on our public facing been improvements on our public facing CVE pages because typically what we have CVE pages because typically what we have CVE pages because typically what we have when we um as part of our continuous when we um as part of our continuous when we um as part of our continuous monitoring we report to our agency uh monitoring we report to our agency uh monitoring we report to our agency uh authoriz authorizer each month. So it's authoriz authorizer each month. So it's authoriz authorizer each month. So it's it's not very it's not uncommon to have it's not very it's not uncommon to have it's not very it's not uncommon to have CVEes where Red Hat would rate them as a CVEes where Red Hat would rate them as a CVEes where Red Hat would rate them as a different severity from say NVD which is different severity from say NVD which is different severity from say NVD which is seen as the sole truth uh sole purveyor seen as the sole truth uh sole purveyor seen as the sole truth uh sole purveyor of truth um as far as severities go. So of truth um as far as severities go. So of truth um as far as severities go. So typically what we have to do um for typically what we have to do um for typically what we have to do um for those we have to document them um and those we have to document them um and those we have to document them um and submit them to our agency for approval submit them to our agency for approval submit them to our agency for approval and we would have to go to our and we would have to go to our and we would have to go to our engineering teams to get an explanation engineering teams to get an explanation engineering teams to get an explanation of like why they why they rated that of like why they why they rated that of like why they why they rated that that particular CVE as a lower severity that particular CVE as a lower severity that particular CVE as a lower severity versus NVD. So as a as kind of a versus NVD. So as a as kind of a versus NVD. So as a as kind of a byproduct of that um and getting those byproduct of that um and getting those byproduct of that um and getting those statements we started to see those statements we started to see those statements we started to see those statements on our public facing pages um statements on our public facing pages um statements on our public facing pages um which was really helpful for for not which was really helpful for for not which was really helpful for for not only our you know our FedREP agency but only our you know our FedREP agency but only our you know our FedREP agency but customers in general. And then as aside customers in general. And then as aside customers in general. And then as aside to that too, we were also um we were to that too, we were also um we were to that too, we were also um we were using our SSP controls within our FedreP using our SSP controls within our FedreP using our SSP controls within our FedreP environment. There's like 400 of them. environment. There's like 400 of them. environment. There's like 400 of them. So we we've been using um those controls So we we've been using um those controls So we we've been using um those controls to evaluate certain CVEes and actually to evaluate certain CVEes and actually to evaluate certain CVEes and actually to to lower the risk because of to to lower the risk because of to to lower the risk because of mitigating control. So those statements mitigating control. So those statements mitigating control. So those statements as well have been published to the CVE as well have been published to the CVE as well have been published to the CVE pages um for like compliance pages um for like compliance pages um for like compliance environments or environments that have environments or environments that have environments or environments that have higher levels of controls. Um, another higher levels of controls. Um, another higher levels of controls. Um, another thing that we saw was refinement of thing that we saw was refinement of thing that we saw was refinement of existing vulnerability remediation existing vulnerability remediation existing vulnerability remediation timeline timelines for upstream timeline timelines for upstream timeline timelines for upstream commercial offerings because we as commercial offerings because we as commercial offerings because we as Fedramp were downstream consumers of the Fedramp were downstream consumers of the Fedramp were downstream consumers of the commercial offerings. So a lot of times commercial offerings. So a lot of times commercial offerings. So a lot of times we would uh go to the engineering teams we would uh go to the engineering teams we would uh go to the engineering teams and ask them to fix um you know CVEEs and ask them to fix um you know CVEEs and ask them to fix um you know CVEEs that are maybe more quicker than than that are maybe more quicker than than that are maybe more quicker than than traditional timelines and that's traditional timelines and that's traditional timelines and that's typically a lot of times you'd see that typically a lot of times you'd see that typically a lot of times you'd see that with moderates and lows as opposed to to with moderates and lows as opposed to to with moderates and lows as opposed to to higher severities. Um another uh impact higher severities. Um another uh impact higher severities. Um another uh impact we saw was extended uh product support we saw was extended uh product support we saw was extended uh product support life cycles. Um, so in addition to life cycles. Um, so in addition to life cycles. Um, so in addition to fixing security vulnerabilities within fixing security vulnerabilities within fixing security vulnerabilities within Fed Ramp, Stephanie can maybe talk to Fed Ramp, Stephanie can maybe talk to Fed Ramp, Stephanie can maybe talk to this a little bit more, but you have to this a little bit more, but you have to this a little bit more, but you have to stay in FIPS approval. So you can't just stay in FIPS approval. So you can't just stay in FIPS approval. So you can't just go to the latest version that's go to the latest version that's go to the latest version that's available in commercial. Um, there are available in commercial. Um, there are available in commercial. Um, there are certain uh cryptographic modules and certain uh cryptographic modules and certain uh cryptographic modules and other other parts of the the underlying other other parts of the the underlying other other parts of the the underlying operating system and software that has operating system and software that has operating system and software that has FIPS approval. Um, so you have to al you FIPS approval. Um, so you have to al you FIPS approval. Um, so you have to al you have to fix vulnerabilities while have to fix vulnerabilities while have to fix vulnerabilities while maintaining uh FIPS approval. So it's maintaining uh FIPS approval. So it's maintaining uh FIPS approval. So it's like kind of like walking a tight rope like kind of like walking a tight rope like kind of like walking a tight rope tight rope. Um and then we also saw the tight rope. Um and then we also saw the tight rope. Um and then we also saw the you know from our work and the scale of you know from our work and the scale of you know from our work and the scale of the work as we added new products and the work as we added new products and the work as we added new products and services we saw the creation of new services we saw the creation of new services we saw the creation of new teams we saw uh internal realignments of teams we saw uh internal realignments of teams we saw uh internal realignments of teams and uh just additional tools and teams and uh just additional tools and teams and uh just additional tools and resources res resources to support fed resources res resources to support fed resources res resources to support fed ramp ramp ramp um and then finally just more broadly um um and then finally just more broadly um um and then finally just more broadly um the a rising tide lifts lifts all boats the a rising tide lifts lifts all boats the a rising tide lifts lifts all boats uh ethos where basically just by do you uh ethos where basically just by do you uh ethos where basically just by do you know all the work we're doing here know all the work we're doing here know all the work we're doing here improving the posture of of of our fed improving the posture of of of our fed improving the posture of of of our fed environment we're also benefiting Red environment we're also benefiting Red environment we're also benefiting Red Hat as well more generally if you had to Hat as well more generally if you had to Hat as well more generally if you had to add. Yeah. Yeah. So, like Fed Ramp was add. Yeah. Yeah. So, like Fed Ramp was add. Yeah. Yeah. So, like Fed Ramp was such a major change for us with a lot of such a major change for us with a lot of such a major change for us with a lot of um there there were a lot of changes um there there were a lot of changes um there there were a lot of changes that were surprisingly not expected that were surprisingly not expected that were surprisingly not expected across the company. So, like Chris across the company. So, like Chris across the company. So, like Chris mentioned earlier, a lot of evangelism mentioned earlier, a lot of evangelism mentioned earlier, a lot of evangelism had to go along with us having to meet had to go along with us having to meet had to go along with us having to meet with teams to to fix things and and you with teams to to fix things and and you with teams to to fix things and and you know, whatever came up. So the huge know, whatever came up. So the huge know, whatever came up. So the huge change that we had that comes along with change that we had that comes along with change that we had that comes along with this kind of a framework, it really this kind of a framework, it really this kind of a framework, it really caused a lot of changes across the caused a lot of changes across the caused a lot of changes across the board, rippling effects. So yeah, I board, rippling effects. So yeah, I board, rippling effects. So yeah, I think a lot for the for the better. think a lot for the for the better. think a lot for the for the better. It depends on who you ask. Yeah. It depends on who you ask. Yeah. It depends on who you ask. Yeah. Right. The the better or close. So now Right. The the better or close. So now Right. The the better or close. So now getting into uh the suggestions that we getting into uh the suggestions that we getting into uh the suggestions that we came up with with trying to fix some of came up with with trying to fix some of came up with with trying to fix some of the issues that that we noticed and the issues that that we noticed and the issues that that we noticed and started to document. So first one I've started to document. So first one I've started to document. So first one I've got the old eyes. I got to come over got the old eyes. I got to come over got the old eyes. I got to come over here. Okay, so blocking poor images. So here. Okay, so blocking poor images. So here. Okay, so blocking poor images. So like I mentioned earlier, I did get like I mentioned earlier, I did get like I mentioned earlier, I did get feedback from engineers saying um you feedback from engineers saying um you feedback from engineers saying um you know that that we probably couldn't do know that that we probably couldn't do know that that we probably couldn't do this and and as I started to share this this and and as I started to share this this and and as I started to share this paper that I wrote as like a seven-page paper that I wrote as like a seven-page paper that I wrote as like a seven-page long paper. I shared it with a lot of long paper. I shared it with a lot of long paper. I shared it with a lot of different engineers um throughout different engineers um throughout different engineers um throughout product security directors, managers product security directors, managers product security directors, managers that were that were that were um that that worked in the areas that I um that that worked in the areas that I um that that worked in the areas that I was going to provide suggestions for. I was going to provide suggestions for. I was going to provide suggestions for. I didn't want to side um like blindside didn't want to side um like blindside didn't want to side um like blindside anybody by um putting a paper out saying anybody by um putting a paper out saying anybody by um putting a paper out saying that I think that these things could that I think that these things could that I think that these things could improve. So I started to get feedback improve. So I started to get feedback improve. So I started to get feedback and it's impossible to keep up with all and it's impossible to keep up with all and it's impossible to keep up with all of the different initiatives and tools of the different initiatives and tools of the different initiatives and tools and things going on in a department like and things going on in a department like and things going on in a department like ours because things are constantly ours because things are constantly ours because things are constantly changing. So changing. So changing. So um I actually was you know somebody um I actually was you know somebody um I actually was you know somebody reached out to me about us moving over reached out to me about us moving over reached out to me about us moving over uh to Conflux as a secure pipeline which uh to Conflux as a secure pipeline which uh to Conflux as a secure pipeline which was talked about yesterday um in our was talked about yesterday um in our was talked about yesterday um in our colleague Rogue's uh presentation if you colleague Rogue's uh presentation if you colleague Rogue's uh presentation if you want to learn more about that. But part want to learn more about that. But part want to learn more about that. But part of it is you can make secure profiles of it is you can make secure profiles of it is you can make secure profiles which can in fact block images that which can in fact block images that which can in fact block images that don't have great health. So that was don't have great health. So that was don't have great health. So that was something that we started to look at and something that we started to look at and something that we started to look at and the company as a whole has a timeline on the company as a whole has a timeline on the company as a whole has a timeline on when we're going to move all of our when we're going to move all of our when we're going to move all of our products over to it. It just takes time. products over to it. It just takes time. products over to it. It just takes time. It's not something you can put in place It's not something you can put in place It's not something you can put in place overnight, but it was really awesome to overnight, but it was really awesome to overnight, but it was really awesome to find out that uh the suggestion that we find out that uh the suggestion that we find out that uh the suggestion that we wanted to give was something that was wanted to give was something that was wanted to give was something that was already being uh worked on. And then already being uh worked on. And then already being uh worked on. And then next enforcing secured development next enforcing secured development next enforcing secured development policies. So our company's very policies. So our company's very policies. So our company's very proactive on everything security. Uh we proactive on everything security. Uh we proactive on everything security. Uh we have a pretty stout secure development have a pretty stout secure development have a pretty stout secure development life cycle process in place. Um all of life cycle process in place. Um all of life cycle process in place. Um all of our products go through it, but it's our products go through it, but it's our products go through it, but it's still developing. It's still in its still developing. It's still in its still developing. It's still in its early stages and um you know there's early stages and um you know there's early stages and um you know there's always room for improvement. So in always room for improvement. So in always room for improvement. So in conversations with the people that lead conversations with the people that lead conversations with the people that lead that area and I started to talk about that area and I started to talk about that area and I started to talk about enforcement enforcement enforcement um because I think we forgot to mention um because I think we forgot to mention um because I think we forgot to mention earlier that FedRamp is downstream from earlier that FedRamp is downstream from earlier that FedRamp is downstream from our commercial products. So that means our commercial products. So that means our commercial products. So that means that uh the majority of the images that that uh the majority of the images that that uh the majority of the images that exist in Fed ramp exists in our exist in Fed ramp exists in our exist in Fed ramp exists in our commercial products as well. So if we're commercial products as well. So if we're commercial products as well. So if we're seeing things there then those seeing things there then those seeing things there then those vulnerabilities also exist in other vulnerabilities also exist in other vulnerabilities also exist in other places. Um, but you know, also keeping places. Um, but you know, also keeping places. Um, but you know, also keeping in mind Fed ramp has to stay a little in mind Fed ramp has to stay a little in mind Fed ramp has to stay a little bit behind commercial in order to meet bit behind commercial in order to meet bit behind commercial in order to meet the FIPS requirements that we talked the FIPS requirements that we talked the FIPS requirements that we talked about in the last section. So I sort of about in the last section. So I sort of about in the last section. So I sort of talked about enforcement, making sure talked about enforcement, making sure talked about enforcement, making sure that if there is major issues coming that if there is major issues coming that if there is major issues coming through and we're talking like important through and we're talking like important through and we're talking like important criticals and exploited items, those criticals and exploited items, those criticals and exploited items, those need to be fixed before they're pushed need to be fixed before they're pushed need to be fixed before they're pushed out into the the production environments out into the the production environments out into the the production environments and released. So, not everything is and released. So, not everything is and released. So, not everything is going to be easy or fixed, you know, as going to be easy or fixed, you know, as going to be easy or fixed, you know, as as soon as other things can be, but it's as soon as other things can be, but it's as soon as other things can be, but it's a something to keep in mind. And there's a something to keep in mind. And there's a something to keep in mind. And there's also exceptions in place for that also exceptions in place for that also exceptions in place for that process. So, are the exceptions a little process. So, are the exceptions a little process. So, are the exceptions a little too loose? Are they okay? And, you know, too loose? Are they okay? And, you know, too loose? Are they okay? And, you know, it meets the needs of the the company. it meets the needs of the the company. it meets the needs of the the company. We do tons of reviews to figure out how We do tons of reviews to figure out how We do tons of reviews to figure out how these vulnerabilities uh impact our these vulnerabilities uh impact our these vulnerabilities uh impact our products and how it could impact our products and how it could impact our products and how it could impact our customer. customer. customer. So it's not like they're not being So it's not like they're not being So it's not like they're not being reviewed and analyzed to use a double reviewed and analyzed to use a double reviewed and analyzed to use a double negative there. So then uh the next negative there. So then uh the next negative there. So then uh the next couple suggestions. Yeah. So I think one couple suggestions. Yeah. So I think one couple suggestions. Yeah. So I think one thing we want to do as a as a suggestion thing we want to do as a as a suggestion thing we want to do as a as a suggestion here is take some of these these trends here is take some of these these trends here is take some of these these trends as we continue to analyze this data and as we continue to analyze this data and as we continue to analyze this data and see other insights is take this um to see other insights is take this um to see other insights is take this um to engineering teams product teams and see engineering teams product teams and see engineering teams product teams and see if we can implement better testing see if we can implement better testing see if we can implement better testing see if we can uh do code reviews for the if we can uh do code reviews for the if we can uh do code reviews for the images and the tools that we use to images and the tools that we use to images and the tools that we use to build the images and then also uh build the images and then also uh build the images and then also uh prioritize resources like I said earlier prioritize resources like I said earlier prioritize resources like I said earlier I think it's the same for everybody you I think it's the same for everybody you I think it's the same for everybody you can only you know you only have so much can only you know you only have so much can only you know you only have so much time engineers only have so much time time engineers only have so much time time engineers only have so much time and you can only fix so many things so and you can only fix so many things so and you can only fix so many things so understanding like which which understanding like which which understanding like which which vulnerabilities are actually um you know vulnerabilities are actually um you know vulnerabilities are actually um you know a higher priority, more of a threat to a higher priority, more of a threat to a higher priority, more of a threat to our particular environment, we would our particular environment, we would our particular environment, we would continue to do that. Maybe integrate continue to do that. Maybe integrate continue to do that. Maybe integrate some some automation aspects so it takes some some automation aspects so it takes some some automation aspects so it takes some of the the manual toil off those some of the the manual toil off those some of the the manual toil off those teams. teams. teams. Um yeah and so the the last two that we Um yeah and so the the last two that we Um yeah and so the the last two that we were suggesting so training training to were suggesting so training training to were suggesting so training training to the actual issue um we recently came up the actual issue um we recently came up the actual issue um we recently came up with some really awesome secure with some really awesome secure with some really awesome secure development training uh that's available development training uh that's available development training uh that's available to the entire company. um it was to the entire company. um it was to the entire company. um it was mandatory for a while and now it's just mandatory for a while and now it's just mandatory for a while and now it's just you know out there and available to you know out there and available to you know out there and available to people. But in going through and people. But in going through and people. But in going through and reviewing all the topics there was reviewing all the topics there was reviewing all the topics there was nothing specific to nothing specific to nothing specific to um you know image health or promoting um you know image health or promoting um you know image health or promoting poor images into a production poor images into a production poor images into a production environment and like what the environment and like what the environment and like what the repercussions of that could be if these repercussions of that could be if these repercussions of that could be if these are the the heftier items that we tend are the the heftier items that we tend are the the heftier items that we tend to as a company put a lot of um time and to as a company put a lot of um time and to as a company put a lot of um time and effort into removing. So my suggestion effort into removing. So my suggestion effort into removing. So my suggestion was to you know make training that's a was to you know make training that's a was to you know make training that's a little bit more relevant so that you little bit more relevant so that you little bit more relevant so that you know the engineers can understand what's know the engineers can understand what's know the engineers can understand what's going on when they're in a situation going on when they're in a situation going on when they're in a situation like that. And then the last one is like that. And then the last one is like that. And then the last one is accountability. Nobody likes to talk accountability. Nobody likes to talk accountability. Nobody likes to talk about accountability but if you have about accountability but if you have about accountability but if you have teams that are on a regular basis teams that are on a regular basis teams that are on a regular basis skirting policies that are put in place skirting policies that are put in place skirting policies that are put in place for a really good reasons accountability for a really good reasons accountability for a really good reasons accountability needs to be put into place and uh needs to be put into place and uh needs to be put into place and uh otherwise things will never change. otherwise things will never change. otherwise things will never change. All right. So, what's All right. So, what's All right. So, what's next? All right. So, some of the things next? All right. So, some of the things next? All right. So, some of the things that we wanted to do moving forward is that we wanted to do moving forward is that we wanted to do moving forward is we're going to definitely continue to we're going to definitely continue to we're going to definitely continue to collaborate with different uh product collaborate with different uh product collaborate with different uh product security and engineering teams to raise security and engineering teams to raise security and engineering teams to raise awareness of these trends and try to awareness of these trends and try to awareness of these trends and try to figure out how we can use them to better figure out how we can use them to better figure out how we can use them to better things uh as much as we can. Uh we're things uh as much as we can. Uh we're things uh as much as we can. Uh we're also going to use these trends to also going to use these trends to also going to use these trends to improve secure development testing and improve secure development testing and improve secure development testing and remediation processes. Uh just going remediation processes. Uh just going remediation processes. Uh just going handinhand with what we just talked handinhand with what we just talked handinhand with what we just talked about on the last slide. uh we want to about on the last slide. uh we want to about on the last slide. uh we want to analyze more statistics analyze more statistics analyze more statistics because the amount that we did just because the amount that we did just because the amount that we did just wasn't enough and we're glutton for wasn't enough and we're glutton for wasn't enough and we're glutton for punishments and want to keep doing more. punishments and want to keep doing more. punishments and want to keep doing more. So something that we were thinking about So something that we were thinking about So something that we were thinking about after um you know putting this together after um you know putting this together after um you know putting this together and also like seeing some of the other and also like seeing some of the other and also like seeing some of the other topics like maybe we should look at the topics like maybe we should look at the topics like maybe we should look at the severity levels per the CWE and figure severity levels per the CWE and figure severity levels per the CWE and figure out like how many were each c for each out like how many were each c for each out like how many were each c for each category like what what were the category like what what were the category like what what were the severity levels because um you know severity levels because um you know severity levels because um you know Vincent talked a couple days ago about Vincent talked a couple days ago about Vincent talked a couple days ago about the the spread across the different the the spread across the different the the spread across the different severity levels you know we had tons of severity levels you know we had tons of severity levels you know we had tons of moderates but absolutely none of them moderates but absolutely none of them moderates but absolutely none of them were exploited So if we look at things were exploited So if we look at things were exploited So if we look at things in terms of that and figure out which in terms of that and figure out which in terms of that and figure out which ones were um which CW categories were ones were um which CW categories were ones were um which CW categories were appearing more and which ones have more appearing more and which ones have more appearing more and which ones have more of the higher category uh higher of the higher category uh higher of the higher category uh higher severity vulnerabilities, we can focus severity vulnerabilities, we can focus severity vulnerabilities, we can focus on those a little bit more. Um and then on those a little bit more. Um and then on those a little bit more. Um and then research metrics related to research metrics related to research metrics related to um time to fix during build testing and um time to fix during build testing and um time to fix during build testing and time to fix in production. So if if we time to fix in production. So if if we time to fix in production. So if if we put these suggestions out and we find put these suggestions out and we find put these suggestions out and we find out that it's you know we want to out that it's you know we want to out that it's you know we want to prevent them from being in the prevent them from being in the prevent them from being in the production production production environment that's that's the main point environment that's that's the main point environment that's that's the main point but we have to look at you know what but we have to look at you know what but we have to look at you know what kind of cost is it going to be to kind of cost is it going to be to kind of cost is it going to be to engineering engineering engineering um and make sure that any suggestions um and make sure that any suggestions um and make sure that any suggestions that we put out are you know worth the that we put out are you know worth the that we put out are you know worth the the effort and time and and so on. Uh the effort and time and and so on. Uh the effort and time and and so on. Uh the last one is continue to aggregate the last one is continue to aggregate the last one is continue to aggregate and study these metrics to help promote and study these metrics to help promote and study these metrics to help promote improvements. And that was our last improvements. And that was our last improvements. And that was our last slide. Thank you so much. If there's we slide. Thank you so much. If there's we slide. Thank you so much. If there's we have like one minute for questions. One have like one minute for questions. One have like one minute for questions. One minute for questions. Are there any questions from the Are there any questions from the Are there any questions from the audience? Oh, we have a question. better be a good one. Hi there. I was better be a good one. Hi there. I was better be a good one. Hi there. I was just curious which aspects of Fed ramp just curious which aspects of Fed ramp just curious which aspects of Fed ramp did you feel were I know unreasonable or did you feel were I know unreasonable or did you feel were I know unreasonable or maybe a bit too honorous. Well, I have maybe a bit too honorous. Well, I have maybe a bit too honorous. Well, I have got an extensive government background got an extensive government background got an extensive government background so I'm pretty used to those requirements so I'm pretty used to those requirements so I'm pretty used to those requirements but um not adapted to the open source. but um not adapted to the open source. but um not adapted to the open source. The one of the the biggest things so the The one of the the biggest things so the The one of the the biggest things so the open source part of it didn't really open source part of it didn't really open source part of it didn't really come too much into play for us. It was come too much into play for us. It was come too much into play for us. It was really just, you know, working. I mean, really just, you know, working. I mean, really just, you know, working. I mean, it does like upstream, it does like upstream, it does like upstream, but for the most part, it's it's but for the most part, it's it's but for the most part, it's it's interesting to get into conversations interesting to get into conversations interesting to get into conversations with your auditors and have to talk with your auditors and have to talk with your auditors and have to talk about this kind of technology because if about this kind of technology because if about this kind of technology because if you look at the 853 controls, and this you look at the 853 controls, and this you look at the 853 controls, and this is my opinion, I think it's a pretty is my opinion, I think it's a pretty is my opinion, I think it's a pretty good educated opinion, but those good educated opinion, but those good educated opinion, but those controls were made a while back when controls were made a while back when controls were made a while back when cloud was not yet widely adopted and cloud was not yet widely adopted and cloud was not yet widely adopted and they were more, you know, more focused they were more, you know, more focused they were more, you know, more focused on, you know, on-prem environments. So on, you know, on-prem environments. So on, you know, on-prem environments. So when you get into these conversations when you get into these conversations when you get into these conversations with um auditors, but more so the with um auditors, but more so the with um auditors, but more so the government representatives, it's hard government representatives, it's hard government representatives, it's hard for them to grasp certain aspects of our for them to grasp certain aspects of our for them to grasp certain aspects of our platform. And I assume that other platform. And I assume that other platform. And I assume that other cloud-based services run into that. So cloud-based services run into that. So cloud-based services run into that. So there's a lot of education that goes there's a lot of education that goes there's a lot of education that goes into place where immediately it's a no, into place where immediately it's a no, into place where immediately it's a no, that's not going to meet the that's not going to meet the that's not going to meet the requirements. This is not compliant. But requirements. This is not compliant. But requirements. This is not compliant. But then we go through and educate them and then we go through and educate them and then we go through and educate them and explain it to them. Then they they come explain it to them. Then they they come explain it to them. Then they they come around a little bit and they understand around a little bit and they understand around a little bit and they understand more. Okay, I know I understand that. more. Okay, I know I understand that. more. Okay, I know I understand that. Um, and I can see now that it's Um, and I can see now that it's Um, and I can see now that it's compliant. So, there's tons of education compliant. So, there's tons of education compliant. So, there's tons of education that goes along with it. Um, I I think that goes along with it. Um, I I think that goes along with it. Um, I I think that there's misconceptions that that there's misconceptions that that there's misconceptions that something like Fed Ramp assumes that something like Fed Ramp assumes that something like Fed Ramp assumes that you're going to remediate every single you're going to remediate every single you're going to remediate every single vulnerability and they expect you to vulnerability and they expect you to vulnerability and they expect you to remediate all of them, but risk remediate all of them, but risk remediate all of them, but risk management is like in the title. So they management is like in the title. So they management is like in the title. So they they give options for like showing that they give options for like showing that they give options for like showing that some of these are false positives, some some of these are false positives, some some of these are false positives, some of them are operational requirements, of them are operational requirements, of them are operational requirements, some of them are um you know vendor some of them are um you know vendor some of them are um you know vendor dependencies, things like that and dependencies, things like that and dependencies, things like that and having a POAM where you can document having a POAM where you can document having a POAM where you can document some of the things that weren't some of the things that weren't some of the things that weren't remediated on time, but that's all there remediated on time, but that's all there remediated on time, but that's all there for a reason. It's all about risk for a reason. It's all about risk for a reason. It's all about risk management. So as long as you can management. So as long as you can management. So as long as you can document it and you can explain it well document it and you can explain it well document it and you can explain it well enough, enough, enough, usually you're able to move forward and usually you're able to move forward and usually you're able to move forward and just continue on with, you know, a just continue on with, you know, a just continue on with, you know, a regular management of a platform like regular management of a platform like regular management of a platform like this. I I think uh what she was saying this. I I think uh what she was saying this. I I think uh what she was saying about fixing everything within the about fixing everything within the about fixing everything within the context of uh FIPS compliance, you're context of uh FIPS compliance, you're context of uh FIPS compliance, you're supposed to remain FIPS compliant, but supposed to remain FIPS compliant, but supposed to remain FIPS compliant, but you're also supposed to fix everything. you're also supposed to fix everything. you're also supposed to fix everything. And it seems like a lot of times they're And it seems like a lot of times they're And it seems like a lot of times they're at odds with each other. So, fortunately at odds with each other. So, fortunately at odds with each other. So, fortunately with the agency we work with that with the agency we work with that with the agency we work with that they've been very flexible and if we they've been very flexible and if we they've been very flexible and if we explain things to them, they've told us explain things to them, they've told us explain things to them, they've told us to prioritize, you know, fixing things. to prioritize, you know, fixing things. to prioritize, you know, fixing things. So, but it's like I said, it's a lot of So, but it's like I said, it's a lot of So, but it's like I said, it's a lot of times they're, you know, they're in times they're, you know, they're in times they're, you know, they're in conflict with each other. So, that that conflict with each other. So, that that conflict with each other. So, that that would be something from my perspective. So the FIPS process. So So the FIPS process. So So the FIPS process. So basically I I work adjacent to the FIPS. basically I I work adjacent to the FIPS. basically I I work adjacent to the FIPS. I get pulled into a lot of FIPS I get pulled into a lot of FIPS I get pulled into a lot of FIPS conversations. No, no, it's a I think so conversations. No, no, it's a I think so conversations. No, no, it's a I think so it goes through the NIST uh it goes through the NIST uh it goes through the NIST uh cryptographic module validation process. cryptographic module validation process. cryptographic module validation process. And so uh you start off with a new And so uh you start off with a new And so uh you start off with a new module. You put it through like a third module. You put it through like a third module. You put it through like a third party testing once you're done with it. party testing once you're done with it. party testing once you're done with it. and that testing um entity says you're and that testing um entity says you're and that testing um entity says you're meeting all these 140-2 or now 140-3 meeting all these 140-2 or now 140-3 meeting all these 140-2 or now 140-3 requirements, you can push it through requirements, you can push it through requirements, you can push it through and get into the queue for NIST CMVP to and get into the queue for NIST CMVP to and get into the queue for NIST CMVP to actually be like approved. They agree, actually be like approved. They agree, actually be like approved. They agree, they concur, and they put you on a list they concur, and they put you on a list they concur, and they put you on a list saying, you know, where you're at in the saying, you know, where you're at in the saying, you know, where you're at in the process. So, in the past, up until about process. So, in the past, up until about process. So, in the past, up until about a year ago, it was very, very rigid with a year ago, it was very, very rigid with a year ago, it was very, very rigid with the government, and they wanted the government, and they wanted the government, and they wanted everything to be FIPS compliant no everything to be FIPS compliant no everything to be FIPS compliant no matter what. So if you needed if you had matter what. So if you needed if you had matter what. So if you needed if you had you know severe vulnerabilities and you you know severe vulnerabilities and you you know severe vulnerabilities and you wanted to move up but your operating wanted to move up but your operating wanted to move up but your operating system wasn't validated you couldn't do system wasn't validated you couldn't do system wasn't validated you couldn't do it. But yeah but now th those have it. But yeah but now th those have it. But yeah but now th those have changed and there's um there's changed and there's um there's changed and there's um there's documentation on the Fed ramp website documentation on the Fed ramp website documentation on the Fed ramp website that talks about you know there there's that talks about you know there there's that talks about you know there there's two different this is like going to go two different this is like going to go two different this is like going to go really in depth. There's there's two really in depth. There's there's two really in depth. There's there's two different streams. There's a there's the different streams. There's a there's the different streams. There's a there's the validated path and then once it's been validated path and then once it's been validated path and then once it's been validated it can go into an update validated it can go into an update validated it can go into an update stream. So anytime it needs to be stream. So anytime it needs to be stream. So anytime it needs to be updated to meet new, you know, remediate updated to meet new, you know, remediate updated to meet new, you know, remediate new vulnerabilities, as long as it's pre new vulnerabilities, as long as it's pre new vulnerabilities, as long as it's pre previously been validated, it's in that previously been validated, it's in that previously been validated, it's in that update stream and it's approved by your update stream and it's approved by your update stream and it's approved by your agency or any agency that wants to agency or any agency that wants to agency or any agency that wants to utilize it, then you know it's a little utilize it, then you know it's a little utilize it, then you know it's a little bit more lenient and it bit more lenient and it bit more lenient and it will you can do that. So there's so many will you can do that. So there's so many will you can do that. So there's so many ins and outs of Fed Ramp, but that that ins and outs of Fed Ramp, but that that ins and outs of Fed Ramp, but that that is a pretty strict one like a fail used is a pretty strict one like a fail used is a pretty strict one like a fail used to be, but now they've kind of relaxed to be, but now they've kind of relaxed to be, but now they've kind of relaxed it a little bit. I think they've been it a little bit. I think they've been it a little bit. I think they've been slow to approve new modules, too. That's slow to approve new modules, too. That's slow to approve new modules, too. That's some of the pressure. CVP had a really some of the pressure. CVP had a really some of the pressure. CVP had a really bad backlog and and uh had to take bad backlog and and uh had to take bad backlog and and uh had to take different measures to try to push people different measures to try to push people different measures to try to push people through and get that moving because it through and get that moving because it through and get that moving because it was such a huge issue. was such a huge issue. was such a huge issue. All right. And at this time, we are out All right. And at this time, we are out All right. And at this time, we are out of time. Uh if you want to further have of time. Uh if you want to further have of time. Uh if you want to further have conversations with Stephanie and Chris, conversations with Stephanie and Chris, conversations with Stephanie and Chris, feel free to reach out to them after the feel free to reach out to them after the feel free to reach out to them after the meeting. Uh we're going to take a short meeting. Uh we're going to take a short meeting. Uh we're going to take a short break. The next meeting in this room break. The next meeting in this room break. The next meeting in this room will be at four o'clock. Let's give a will be at four o'clock. Let's give a will be at four o'clock. Let's give a good round of applause for the good round of applause for the good round of applause for the presenters.
