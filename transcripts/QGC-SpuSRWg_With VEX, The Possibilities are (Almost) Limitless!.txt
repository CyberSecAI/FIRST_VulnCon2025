I'm the vice president of Red Hat product vice president of Red Hat product vice president of Red Hat product security. Um, I've been in the open security. Um, I've been in the open security. Um, I've been in the open source security industry, arena, source security industry, arena, source security industry, arena, whatever, for almost 25 years. Uh, 16 whatever, for almost 25 years. Uh, 16 whatever, for almost 25 years. Uh, 16 years at Red Hat and eight years at years at Red Hat and eight years at years at Red Hat and eight years at Mandrea. Prior to that, uh, I was Mandrea. Prior to that, uh, I was Mandrea. Prior to that, uh, I was basically their entire, uh, security basically their entire, uh, security basically their entire, uh, security team over there. So, I've been doing team over there. So, I've been doing team over there. So, I've been doing this for a really long this for a really long this for a really long time. Um, throughout all of that, I'm time. Um, throughout all of that, I'm time. Um, throughout all of that, I'm going to make this claim. I'm not a going to make this claim. I'm not a going to make this claim. I'm not a professional developer of any kind. Uh, professional developer of any kind. Uh, professional developer of any kind. Uh, but I have written a lot of code over but I have written a lot of code over but I have written a lot of code over the last 25 years, uh, in a number of the last 25 years, uh, in a number of the last 25 years, uh, in a number of different languages. And my day job is different languages. And my day job is different languages. And my day job is not writing code, um, as much as I'd not writing code, um, as much as I'd not writing code, um, as much as I'd sometimes like it to be. And it hasn't sometimes like it to be. And it hasn't sometimes like it to be. And it hasn't been for some time. uh but last year I been for some time. uh but last year I been for some time. uh but last year I found myself in the position of needing found myself in the position of needing found myself in the position of needing to write some code uh which is what I to write some code uh which is what I to write some code uh which is what I want to talk to uh you all about want to talk to uh you all about want to talk to uh you all about today. So a few years ago a member of my today. So a few years ago a member of my today. So a few years ago a member of my team brought up the idea of VEX team brought up the idea of VEX team brought up the idea of VEX replacing Oval and I didn't exactly replacing Oval and I didn't exactly replacing Oval and I didn't exactly laugh at them at the time but I laugh at them at the time but I laugh at them at the time but I certainly disagreed with it as any kind certainly disagreed with it as any kind certainly disagreed with it as any kind of a priority. Uh thankfully they of a priority. Uh thankfully they of a priority. Uh thankfully they ignored me and pushed forward anyways. ignored me and pushed forward anyways. ignored me and pushed forward anyways. Now, um, we've started adopting the Now, um, we've started adopting the Now, um, we've started adopting the creation of these vex documents and we creation of these vex documents and we creation of these vex documents and we have been producing oval documents since have been producing oval documents since have been producing oval documents since about 2006. We've been doing this for a about 2006. We've been doing this for a about 2006. We've been doing this for a really long time. Uh, we still publish really long time. Uh, we still publish really long time. Uh, we still publish oval documents today uh, for current oval documents today uh, for current oval documents today uh, for current releases, but in the future we're going releases, but in the future we're going releases, but in the future we're going to be producing VEX only. Now, we to be producing VEX only. Now, we to be producing VEX only. Now, we started publishing VEX documents for started publishing VEX documents for started publishing VEX documents for consumers and customers to test in 2023. consumers and customers to test in 2023. consumers and customers to test in 2023. And we've been producing them as a And we've been producing them as a And we've been producing them as a primary uh, security document since primary uh, security document since primary uh, security document since 2024. But before we get into it, what's the But before we get into it, what's the But before we get into it, what's the real problem that VEX is trying to real problem that VEX is trying to real problem that VEX is trying to solve? I would posit it's better, more solve? I would posit it's better, more solve? I would posit it's better, more accurate information on whether or not a accurate information on whether or not a accurate information on whether or not a system is actually vulnerable to a system is actually vulnerable to a system is actually vulnerable to a particular vulnerability. So, you'd particular vulnerability. So, you'd particular vulnerability. So, you'd think this wasn't really a problem that think this wasn't really a problem that think this wasn't really a problem that needed to be solved, right? Well, we needed to be solved, right? Well, we needed to be solved, right? Well, we have dozens of vulnerability scanners have dozens of vulnerability scanners have dozens of vulnerability scanners and they all work basically the same way and they all work basically the same way and they all work basically the same way and they all produce false positives. and they all produce false positives. and they all produce false positives. But more importantly, they also produce But more importantly, they also produce But more importantly, they also produce false negatives. Now, VEX can help uh false negatives. Now, VEX can help uh false negatives. Now, VEX can help uh provide very accurate information here provide very accurate information here provide very accurate information here that scanning vendors could and probably that scanning vendors could and probably that scanning vendors could and probably should use. After all, they used Oval should use. After all, they used Oval should use. After all, they used Oval and still use it despite Oval's and still use it despite Oval's and still use it despite Oval's limitations. And I think that everyone limitations. And I think that everyone limitations. And I think that everyone here wants to see more here wants to see more here wants to see more accuracy. Now, what you see on the accuracy. Now, what you see on the accuracy. Now, what you see on the screen right now is not accuracy. This screen right now is not accuracy. This screen right now is not accuracy. This is a fully up-to-date RE95 virtual is a fully up-to-date RE95 virtual is a fully up-to-date RE95 virtual machine with no Red Hat rated critical machine with no Red Hat rated critical machine with no Red Hat rated critical or important vulnerabilities. And yet or important vulnerabilities. And yet or important vulnerabilities. And yet you can see that this particular scanner you can see that this particular scanner you can see that this particular scanner claims that there are over claims that there are over claims that there are over 600 important findings. So after we uh started findings. So after we uh started findings. So after we uh started producing these VEX documents, I asked producing these VEX documents, I asked producing these VEX documents, I asked the team what I thought was to me a the team what I thought was to me a the team what I thought was to me a fairly simple question. How does an fairly simple question. How does an fairly simple question. How does an enduser use them and what tools are we enduser use them and what tools are we enduser use them and what tools are we providing for them to do providing for them to do providing for them to do so? While to date we still ship Open so? While to date we still ship Open so? While to date we still ship Open Scap which reads those oval documents. Scap which reads those oval documents. Scap which reads those oval documents. So I assumed that we would have some So I assumed that we would have some So I assumed that we would have some sort of tool that allowed our customers sort of tool that allowed our customers sort of tool that allowed our customers and users to be able to use these shiny and users to be able to use these shiny and users to be able to use these shiny new documents that we're producing. And new documents that we're producing. And new documents that we're producing. And I was given the most unsatisfactory I was given the most unsatisfactory I was given the most unsatisfactory answer. You can probably find something answer. You can probably find something answer. You can probably find something from from from Oasis. So, we used the CESAF VEX format Oasis. So, we used the CESAF VEX format Oasis. So, we used the CESAF VEX format and so that would make sense, but we and so that would make sense, but we and so that would make sense, but we didn't have any tooling that read our didn't have any tooling that read our didn't have any tooling that read our own VEX documents. Um, okay. And that actually documents. Um, okay. And that actually documents. Um, okay. And that actually didn't feel right to me because it meant didn't feel right to me because it meant didn't feel right to me because it meant that we were producing something, not that we were producing something, not that we were producing something, not using it ourselves, and not letting our using it ourselves, and not letting our using it ourselves, and not letting our customers know how to use it. Uh, so it customers know how to use it. Uh, so it customers know how to use it. Uh, so it kind of felt to me like kind of felt to me like kind of felt to me like esbombs. We would produce them and then esbombs. We would produce them and then esbombs. We would produce them and then leave it up to customers on how to leave it up to customers on how to leave it up to customers on how to figure out how to use them um without figure out how to use them um without figure out how to use them um without giving them any direction giving them any direction giving them any direction whatsoever. I don't like that. So I whatsoever. I don't like that. So I whatsoever. I don't like that. So I wanted to do something different. I wanted to do something different. I wanted to do something different. I wanted to do something about that wanted to do something about that wanted to do something about that especially uh when I started digging especially uh when I started digging especially uh when I started digging into what these vex documents were and into what these vex documents were and into what these vex documents were and what I thought that their potential what I thought that their potential what I thought that their potential could be. So uh first I'm going to take a be. So uh first I'm going to take a be. So uh first I'm going to take a quick step back. Right. Right. So, Red quick step back. Right. Right. So, Red quick step back. Right. Right. So, Red Hat has had a public CVE database pretty Hat has had a public CVE database pretty Hat has had a public CVE database pretty much since we started using CVE what 25 much since we started using CVE what 25 much since we started using CVE what 25 years ago. And over time, we went from years ago. And over time, we went from years ago. And over time, we went from statically generated CV pages to dynamic statically generated CV pages to dynamic statically generated CV pages to dynamic CV pages that live in our customer CV pages that live in our customer CV pages that live in our customer portal. We went from describing the CVE, portal. We went from describing the CVE, portal. We went from describing the CVE, its impact, uh, which AATA were fixed, its impact, uh, which AATA were fixed, its impact, uh, which AATA were fixed, uh, in that or that fixed those CVEes, uh, in that or that fixed those CVEes, uh, in that or that fixed those CVEes, uh, to showing all affected packages, a uh, to showing all affected packages, a uh, to showing all affected packages, a status of whether or not we would fix status of whether or not we would fix status of whether or not we would fix them, CVSS information, C.WE them, CVSS information, C.WE them, CVSS information, C.WE information, statements, mitigations, information, statements, mitigations, information, statements, mitigations, and honestly, a lot more than that. Now, and honestly, a lot more than that. Now, and honestly, a lot more than that. Now, our CV pages have never been behind a our CV pages have never been behind a our CV pages have never been behind a payw wall and um they've always been payw wall and um they've always been payw wall and um they've always been publicly available to anyone who wants publicly available to anyone who wants publicly available to anyone who wants to view them. Customers, industry, to view them. Customers, industry, to view them. Customers, industry, competitors, doesn't matter. Um as time competitors, doesn't matter. Um as time competitors, doesn't matter. Um as time went on, we provided more and more went on, we provided more and more went on, we provided more and more information on these pages so that our information on these pages so that our information on these pages so that our customers could have the most customers could have the most customers could have the most information on potential risk as information on potential risk as information on potential risk as possible. Uh so that they could mitigate possible. Uh so that they could mitigate possible. Uh so that they could mitigate any risk that they feel or they felt any risk that they feel or they felt any risk that they feel or they felt that they were exposed to. uh that they were exposed to. uh that they were exposed to. uh transparency is one of those key transparency is one of those key transparency is one of those key ingredients of our vulnerability ingredients of our vulnerability ingredients of our vulnerability management philosophy and I talk about management philosophy and I talk about management philosophy and I talk about that a little bit more and some of the that a little bit more and some of the that a little bit more and some of the challenges that come from being so challenges that come from being so challenges that come from being so transparent in my talk on open source transparent in my talk on open source transparent in my talk on open source risk acceptance and equity on Wednesday. risk acceptance and equity on Wednesday. risk acceptance and equity on Wednesday. So shameless plug for two days from now. So shameless plug for two days from now. So shameless plug for two days from now. Uh and when it comes to challenges, one Uh and when it comes to challenges, one Uh and when it comes to challenges, one example that we hear about from our example that we hear about from our example that we hear about from our customers quite often is that they would customers quite often is that they would customers quite often is that they would like to have our CV information like to have our CV information like to have our CV information available to them in disconnected available to them in disconnected available to them in disconnected environments. And it occurred to me that environments. And it occurred to me that environments. And it occurred to me that VEX would be a potential solution for that. So I gave myself the challenge uh that. So I gave myself the challenge uh that. So I gave myself the challenge uh reproduce our CVE pages using only VEX reproduce our CVE pages using only VEX reproduce our CVE pages using only VEX as input. The CVE database on our as input. The CVE database on our as input. The CVE database on our customer portal has a lot of magic customer portal has a lot of magic customer portal has a lot of magic behind the scenes that wasn't captured behind the scenes that wasn't captured behind the scenes that wasn't captured in our early VEX data. And I had to file in our early VEX data. And I had to file in our early VEX data. And I had to file a few bugs to ask the team to expose a few bugs to ask the team to expose a few bugs to ask the team to expose more of that information in VEX. Um, and more of that information in VEX. Um, and more of that information in VEX. Um, and I had to figure out a way to parse that I had to figure out a way to parse that I had to figure out a way to parse that vex document since we didn't have a tool vex document since we didn't have a tool vex document since we didn't have a tool that would do it for me. Uh, so to do that would do it for me. Uh, so to do that would do it for me. Uh, so to do that I had to do two things. Uh, first that I had to do two things. Uh, first that I had to do two things. Uh, first obviously I had to parse the vex obviously I had to parse the vex obviously I had to parse the vex document and then secondly I had to find document and then secondly I had to find document and then secondly I had to find a way to display it uh, on the web. And a way to display it uh, on the web. And a way to display it uh, on the web. And I had to do this from scratch again I had to do this from scratch again I had to do this from scratch again because we hadn't built any of those because we hadn't built any of those because we hadn't built any of those tools uh, to do it when we started tools uh, to do it when we started tools uh, to do it when we started publishing these vex documents. So in July last year, I documents. So in July last year, I documents. So in July last year, I started writing the VEX reader Python started writing the VEX reader Python started writing the VEX reader Python library. And since my goal was not to library. And since my goal was not to library. And since my goal was not to keep this to myself, but to to keep this to myself, but to to keep this to myself, but to to illustrate that this could be useful for illustrate that this could be useful for illustrate that this could be useful for others, I made it open source and others, I made it open source and others, I made it open source and available as a Python module on Pippi uh available as a Python module on Pippi uh available as a Python module on Pippi uh that anyone could use. And this was the that anyone could use. And this was the that anyone could use. And this was the building blocks for that web display building blocks for that web display building blocks for that web display that I would eventually write. Now, that I would eventually write. Now, that I would eventually write. Now, since VEX is just a JSON document, it since VEX is just a JSON document, it since VEX is just a JSON document, it didn't take very long to get a working didn't take very long to get a working didn't take very long to get a working prototype. Although, I am going to offer prototype. Although, I am going to offer prototype. Although, I am going to offer one caveat. one caveat. one caveat. initially and even today it only works initially and even today it only works initially and even today it only works properly with CESF VEX and in particular properly with CESF VEX and in particular properly with CESF VEX and in particular Red Hat CEF VEX documents and I'll get Red Hat CEF VEX documents and I'll get Red Hat CEF VEX documents and I'll get into a little bit of that uh in a into a little bit of that uh in a into a little bit of that uh in a minute. I have not tried it uh with minute. I have not tried it uh with minute. I have not tried it uh with OpenVEX documents. That's next on my OpenVEX documents. That's next on my OpenVEX documents. That's next on my list at some point. Um and a limited list at some point. Um and a limited list at some point. Um and a limited number of other vendors CESF VEX documents. Now, to start with, I just documents. Now, to start with, I just documents. Now, to start with, I just wanted it to print out and organize wanted it to print out and organize wanted it to print out and organize information when parsing a VEX file. So, information when parsing a VEX file. So, information when parsing a VEX file. So, could I get it to give me all of the could I get it to give me all of the could I get it to give me all of the information uh and all the details in information uh and all the details in information uh and all the details in that vex document on the command line in that vex document on the command line in that vex document on the command line in a fairly simple way to read? Um, it a fairly simple way to read? Um, it a fairly simple way to read? Um, it isn't a very simple way to read. It's a isn't a very simple way to read. It's a isn't a very simple way to read. It's a little small on the screen, but uh it little small on the screen, but uh it little small on the screen, but uh it does a pretty good job of does a pretty good job of does a pretty good job of it. Uh, but it wasn't enough for me just it. Uh, but it wasn't enough for me just it. Uh, but it wasn't enough for me just to have it show up on the command line. to have it show up on the command line. to have it show up on the command line. Ultimately, what I wanted was to be able Ultimately, what I wanted was to be able Ultimately, what I wanted was to be able to reproduce our CV pages again uh using to reproduce our CV pages again uh using to reproduce our CV pages again uh using only that VEX content. But there are a only that VEX content. But there are a only that VEX content. But there are a couple other caveats. The VEX data only couple other caveats. The VEX data only couple other caveats. The VEX data only shows vendor information. So, I needed shows vendor information. So, I needed shows vendor information. So, I needed it to also pull in uh information from it to also pull in uh information from it to also pull in uh information from NVD because our CV pages currently also NVD because our CV pages currently also NVD because our CV pages currently also lift list NVD information on those lift list NVD information on those lift list NVD information on those pages. Um but while I was at it, I pages. Um but while I was at it, I pages. Um but while I was at it, I wanted to pull in data from cv.org or um wanted to pull in data from cv.org or um wanted to pull in data from cv.org or um as well to collect those ADP CBSS scores as well to collect those ADP CBSS scores as well to collect those ADP CBSS scores that got assigned there. And since I was that got assigned there. And since I was that got assigned there. And since I was doing this as a proof of concept, I doing this as a proof of concept, I doing this as a proof of concept, I figured why not pull in the first EPSS figured why not pull in the first EPSS figured why not pull in the first EPSS data as well. And with this, I data as well. And with this, I data as well. And with this, I illustrated two things. Um first, you illustrated two things. Um first, you illustrated two things. Um first, you could have that disconnected could have that disconnected could have that disconnected representation of our CV pages in your representation of our CV pages in your representation of our CV pages in your own environment uh fairly easily, own environment uh fairly easily, own environment uh fairly easily, assuming that you didn't need to pull in assuming that you didn't need to pull in assuming that you didn't need to pull in other sources like NVD. other sources like NVD. other sources like NVD. Um, but if you were a vendor, you could Um, but if you were a vendor, you could Um, but if you were a vendor, you could also create CV pages for your own also create CV pages for your own also create CV pages for your own customers and you could do it pretty customers and you could do it pretty customers and you could do it pretty easily uh with a fairly lightweight web easily uh with a fairly lightweight web easily uh with a fairly lightweight web application. And for Red Hat, our CV application. And for Red Hat, our CV application. And for Red Hat, our CV pages are connected to our customer pages are connected to our customer pages are connected to our customer portal and there's a significant amount portal and there's a significant amount portal and there's a significant amount of overhead uh to get any changes to of overhead uh to get any changes to of overhead uh to get any changes to that uh data incorporated. Uh so my that uh data incorporated. Uh so my that uh data incorporated. Uh so my personal aim here was to show that personal aim here was to show that personal aim here was to show that perhaps one day we might be able to perhaps one day we might be able to perhaps one day we might be able to decouple our CV pages from the customer decouple our CV pages from the customer decouple our CV pages from the customer portal and be able to rapidly update and portal and be able to rapidly update and portal and be able to rapidly update and improve the features and functionality improve the features and functionality improve the features and functionality of our CV of our CV of our CV pages and it works pretty well. Um with pages and it works pretty well. Um with pages and it works pretty well. Um with a Python Flask web application running a Python Flask web application running a Python Flask web application running on Python anywhere I have a on Python anywhere I have a on Python anywhere I have a representation of our CV pages without a representation of our CV pages without a representation of our CV pages without a database that updates in real time. database that updates in real time. database that updates in real time. Well, it has a 1 hour cache, so almost Well, it has a 1 hour cache, so almost Well, it has a 1 hour cache, so almost real time. It pulls the VEX documents real time. It pulls the VEX documents real time. It pulls the VEX documents directly from Red Hat's uh website. It directly from Red Hat's uh website. It directly from Red Hat's uh website. It talks to NVD, cv.org, and first via talks to NVD, cv.org, and first via talks to NVD, cv.org, and first via their respective their respective their respective APIs. Now, that's pretty neat, right? APIs. Now, that's pretty neat, right? APIs. Now, that's pretty neat, right? That's that scratched my own itch. But That's that scratched my own itch. But That's that scratched my own itch. But what else can we do with uh this VEX what else can we do with uh this VEX what else can we do with uh this VEX data? It actually turns out that you can data? It actually turns out that you can data? It actually turns out that you can do quite a lot. do quite a lot. do quite a lot. So one of my team members is heavily So one of my team members is heavily So one of my team members is heavily focused on AI and experimentation to see focused on AI and experimentation to see focused on AI and experimentation to see how we can use AI to make our lives a how we can use AI to make our lives a how we can use AI to make our lives a little easier just like everybody else. little easier just like everybody else. little easier just like everybody else. Uh so he used AI to generate code based Uh so he used AI to generate code based Uh so he used AI to generate code based on my VEX library uh that parses a VEX on my VEX library uh that parses a VEX on my VEX library uh that parses a VEX document and turns it into a hugging document and turns it into a hugging document and turns it into a hugging face data set. So a few months ago I face data set. So a few months ago I face data set. So a few months ago I casually mentioned that it would be casually mentioned that it would be casually mentioned that it would be ideal if we could use AI to get insights ideal if we could use AI to get insights ideal if we could use AI to get insights into our vulnerabilities. you know, into our vulnerabilities. you know, into our vulnerabilities. you know, maybe uh which CD uh CWE shows up the maybe uh which CD uh CWE shows up the maybe uh which CD uh CWE shows up the most uh in a given time frame, what most uh in a given time frame, what most uh in a given time frame, what components get the most CVE? Uh components get the most CVE? Uh components get the most CVE? Uh obviously before the Linux kernel became obviously before the Linux kernel became obviously before the Linux kernel became a CNA because now it will always and a CNA because now it will always and a CNA because now it will always and forever be the Linux kernel. Um, so forever be the Linux kernel. Um, so forever be the Linux kernel. Um, so there's a lot of things that we could there's a lot of things that we could there's a lot of things that we could kind of mine out of our VEX data or our kind of mine out of our VEX data or our kind of mine out of our VEX data or our CV data. And using AI in this way could CV data. And using AI in this way could CV data. And using AI in this way could help our analysts also become more help our analysts also become more help our analysts also become more quickly and consistently, you know, quickly and consistently, you know, quickly and consistently, you know, assigned severity ratings and CVSS assigned severity ratings and CVSS assigned severity ratings and CVSS scores uh perhaps based on previous scores uh perhaps based on previous scores uh perhaps based on previous assignments, how a vulnerability is assignments, how a vulnerability is assignments, how a vulnerability is described, what a component is, and so described, what a component is, and so described, what a component is, and so there's a lot of opportunity there's a lot of opportunity there's a lot of opportunity here. And so he did and now there's an here. And so he did and now there's an here. And so he did and now there's an unofficial data set on hugging face that unofficial data set on hugging face that unofficial data set on hugging face that is updated daily. Uh he used this data is updated daily. Uh he used this data is updated daily. Uh he used this data so that he could ask uh the AI uh so that he could ask uh the AI uh so that he could ask uh the AI uh questions and he even found some questions and he even found some questions and he even found some discrepancies in our data which is discrepancies in our data which is discrepancies in our data which is pretty cool and that helped us because pretty cool and that helped us because pretty cool and that helped us because we could then go back in and fix our we could then go back in and fix our we could then go back in and fix our data uh making sure that our information data uh making sure that our information data uh making sure that our information is as accurate as possible. Uh, and this is as accurate as possible. Uh, and this is as accurate as possible. Uh, and this is all possible by feeding a standard is all possible by feeding a standard is all possible by feeding a standard set of data into a source of data that set of data into a source of data that set of data into a source of data that is easily consumed by AI systems. Again, is easily consumed by AI systems. Again, is easily consumed by AI systems. Again, all based on our VEX all based on our VEX all based on our VEX documents. And yet, if you're more documents. And yet, if you're more documents. And yet, if you're more traditional uh, like me, you can also traditional uh, like me, you can also traditional uh, like me, you can also query that data set like a SQL database, query that data set like a SQL database, query that data set like a SQL database, right? So, I found a library called right? So, I found a library called right? So, I found a library called DuckDB that will allow me to download a DuckDB that will allow me to download a DuckDB that will allow me to download a hugging face data set and query it like hugging face data set and query it like hugging face data set and query it like a SQL database. I haven't gotten too far a SQL database. I haven't gotten too far a SQL database. I haven't gotten too far with it yet, but it means that I don't with it yet, but it means that I don't with it yet, but it means that I don't have to import all of the VEX documents have to import all of the VEX documents have to import all of the VEX documents into a SQL database myself. I can let into a SQL database myself. I can let into a SQL database myself. I can let somebody else take care of that and then somebody else take care of that and then somebody else take care of that and then write queries like I normally would and write queries like I normally would and write queries like I normally would and mine it for information in a way that's mine it for information in a way that's mine it for information in a way that's familiar to me if I don't want AI to do familiar to me if I don't want AI to do familiar to me if I don't want AI to do it for me. Forgive me if I don't trust it for me. Forgive me if I don't trust it for me. Forgive me if I don't trust the machines quite the machines quite the machines quite yet. So, what's next? Well, I tried yet. So, what's next? Well, I tried yet. So, what's next? Well, I tried using the VEX reader to load uh SUSE's using the VEX reader to load uh SUSE's using the VEX reader to load uh SUSE's VEX files, and I found some differences. VEX files, and I found some differences. VEX files, and I found some differences. Um, notably here, the way that they Um, notably here, the way that they Um, notably here, the way that they represented ISO dates is different than represented ISO dates is different than represented ISO dates is different than the way that Red Hat represented them. the way that Red Hat represented them. the way that Red Hat represented them. And it highlighted a bug in Python 3.9's And it highlighted a bug in Python 3.9's And it highlighted a bug in Python 3.9's handling of ISO format date strings. handling of ISO format date strings. handling of ISO format date strings. Causes a crash. Uh, so there was a bug Causes a crash. Uh, so there was a bug Causes a crash. Uh, so there was a bug that I had to that I had to that I had to fix. And thankfully, uh, somebody fix. And thankfully, uh, somebody fix. And thankfully, uh, somebody submitted a pull request that fixed it. submitted a pull request that fixed it. submitted a pull request that fixed it. Fortunately, I realized it a few months Fortunately, I realized it a few months Fortunately, I realized it a few months later. uh because I had turned off later. uh because I had turned off later. uh because I had turned off GitHub notifications uh because my GitHub notifications uh because my GitHub notifications uh because my wonderful team has me on all of the wonderful team has me on all of the wonderful team has me on all of the GitHub repositories that Red Hat product GitHub repositories that Red Hat product GitHub repositories that Red Hat product security has out there and when I turned security has out there and when I turned security has out there and when I turned them back on I realize why I turned them them back on I realize why I turned them them back on I realize why I turned them off. I'm getting spammed by so much off. I'm getting spammed by so much off. I'm getting spammed by so much stuff that I just matters to them stuff that I just matters to them stuff that I just matters to them doesn't matter to doesn't matter to doesn't matter to me. So I don't know if we're doing it me. So I don't know if we're doing it me. So I don't know if we're doing it wrong or if Susi is doing it wrong but wrong or if Susi is doing it wrong but wrong or if Susi is doing it wrong but their data is definitely different from their data is definitely different from their data is definitely different from ours. ours. ours. uh despite being in that CEF VEX format. uh despite being in that CEF VEX format. uh despite being in that CEF VEX format. So there's a few bugs to fix and some So there's a few bugs to fix and some So there's a few bugs to fix and some further investigation that needs to be further investigation that needs to be further investigation that needs to be done to account for those differences. done to account for those differences. done to account for those differences. But eventually uh my intent is that VEX But eventually uh my intent is that VEX But eventually uh my intent is that VEX reader will be able to read Sousay's vex reader will be able to read Sousay's vex reader will be able to read Sousay's vex files. And as I've looked at others, um files. And as I've looked at others, um files. And as I've looked at others, um Red Hat definitely puts a lot more data Red Hat definitely puts a lot more data Red Hat definitely puts a lot more data into our VEX files as an example. Um into our VEX files as an example. Um into our VEX files as an example. Um Cisco is another example. And I believe Cisco is another example. And I believe Cisco is another example. And I believe somebody's going to be talking about somebody's going to be talking about somebody's going to be talking about Cisco's VEX files shortly later this Cisco's VEX files shortly later this Cisco's VEX files shortly later this morning. Um, they're readable. It did readable. It did readable. It did work. It work. It work. It it it did work, but and I don't have a it it did work, but and I don't have a it it did work, but and I don't have a screenshot for it. I I won't Okay. All screenshot for it. I I won't Okay. All screenshot for it. I I won't Okay. All right. There are secrets coming later. right. There are secrets coming later. right. There are secrets coming later. I'll leave that to you. Uh, it does I'll leave that to you. Uh, it does I'll leave that to you. Uh, it does work, right? Um, there are differences work, right? Um, there are differences work, right? Um, there are differences though. Um, from my perspective, they though. Um, from my perspective, they though. Um, from my perspective, they don't provide as much information, say, don't provide as much information, say, don't provide as much information, say, as our Red Hat ones do, but maybe that's as our Red Hat ones do, but maybe that's as our Red Hat ones do, but maybe that's okay. Uh that could simply be a okay. Uh that could simply be a okay. Uh that could simply be a difference between open source and difference between open source and difference between open source and proprietary software in many. in many. in many. Can you repeat the gold standard part Can you repeat the gold standard part Can you repeat the gold standard part first for the people online? I don't I first for the people online? I don't I first for the people online? I don't I don't know what you're talking about. don't know what you're talking about. don't know what you're talking about. Um no not only not only in beex but I Um no not only not only in beex but I Um no not only not only in beex but I was with the Cisco pel the pro security was with the Cisco pel the pro security was with the Cisco pel the pro security in response team for more than 20 years in response team for more than 20 years in response team for more than 20 years and in many cases when we were looking and in many cases when we were looking and in many cases when we were looking at vulnerability and we were like man at vulnerability and we were like man at vulnerability and we were like man this is hard immediately you know this is hard immediately you know this is hard immediately you know instead of what will Jesus do we will instead of what will Jesus do we will instead of what will Jesus do we will like what does red hat like what does red hat like what does red hat say so for from our point of view you say so for from our point of view you say so for from our point of view you guys so I don't want to say we look up guys so I don't want to say we look up guys so I don't want to say we look up to you but we kind of look up you know to you but we kind of look up you know to you but we kind of look up you know okay so yeah that's that's my feedback okay so yeah that's that's my feedback okay so yeah that's that's my feedback to Thank you. I appreciate that. Um, to Thank you. I appreciate that. Um, to Thank you. I appreciate that. Um, thank you. Uh, my head has not swelled. thank you. Uh, my head has not swelled. thank you.

Um, kidding. Yeah. Yeah. No, thank you. Um, no, I appreciate it. Right. Because a no, I appreciate it. Right. Because a no, I appreciate it. Right. Because a lot of the things that we're doing, lot of the things that we're doing, lot of the things that we're doing, we're trying to to lead the way in some we're trying to to lead the way in some we're trying to to lead the way in some examples, right? And I mean, this goes examples, right? And I mean, this goes examples, right? And I mean, this goes back to our philosophy and ethos of back to our philosophy and ethos of back to our philosophy and ethos of transparent information. And I mean we transparent information. And I mean we transparent information. And I mean we believe that everybody should kind of be believe that everybody should kind of be believe that everybody should kind of be like us because our customers value it. like us because our customers value it. like us because our customers value it. Again it kind of bites us in the rear Again it kind of bites us in the rear Again it kind of bites us in the rear end a little bit because we are so end a little bit because we are so end a little bit because we are so transparent, right? Uh but when it comes transparent, right? Uh but when it comes transparent, right? Uh but when it comes to the data and the tools and just the to the data and the tools and just the to the data and the tools and just the way of representing these things, we way of representing these things, we way of representing these things, we want our our customers and users to be want our our customers and users to be want our our customers and users to be able to understand their risk fully and able to understand their risk fully and able to understand their risk fully and not try to hide any of it, right? So we not try to hide any of it, right? So we not try to hide any of it, right? So we always try to kind of uh push the edge a always try to kind of uh push the edge a always try to kind of uh push the edge a little bit because we think it's little bit because we think it's little bit because we think it's important. So I I definitely appreciate important. So I I definitely appreciate important. So I I definitely appreciate that feedback. Thank you. Um, there's also OpenVEX, um, which is Um, there's also OpenVEX, um, which is Um, there's also OpenVEX, um, which is something that I haven't looked at yet, something that I haven't looked at yet, something that I haven't looked at yet, so I'm not sure how different it is from so I'm not sure how different it is from so I'm not sure how different it is from CFX. Uh, but it does highlight where I CFX. Uh, but it does highlight where I CFX. Uh, but it does highlight where I think we're going to see some challenges think we're going to see some challenges think we're going to see some challenges when it comes to broad VEX when it comes to broad VEX when it comes to broad VEX adoption. Um, my library is one thing, adoption. Um, my library is one thing, adoption. Um, my library is one thing, but if we want scanning vendors to use but if we want scanning vendors to use but if we want scanning vendors to use VEX, and we should, there might need to VEX, and we should, there might need to VEX, and we should, there might need to be more consistency between vendor be more consistency between vendor be more consistency between vendor provided VEX documents. Now thankfully provided VEX documents. Now thankfully provided VEX documents. Now thankfully these scanning vendors um charge these scanning vendors um charge these scanning vendors um charge outrageous amounts of money for them to outrageous amounts of money for them to outrageous amounts of money for them to use. So they have people who are paid to use. So they have people who are paid to use. So they have people who are paid to be able to do this sort of work, right? be able to do this sort of work, right? be able to do this sort of work, right? But unless they see the advantages and But unless they see the advantages and But unless they see the advantages and enough vendors start producing VEX enough vendors start producing VEX enough vendors start producing VEX documents, where's the incentive for documents, where's the incentive for documents, where's the incentive for these scanning vendors to actually use these scanning vendors to actually use these scanning vendors to actually use the things that we're producing? So, we the things that we're producing? So, we the things that we're producing? So, we have to figure out ways to incentivize have to figure out ways to incentivize have to figure out ways to incentivize scanning vendors uh to use that data scanning vendors uh to use that data scanning vendors uh to use that data because it's designed to produce more because it's designed to produce more because it's designed to produce more accurate results than we're seeing today accurate results than we're seeing today accurate results than we're seeing today with older technologies and the way that with older technologies and the way that with older technologies and the way that a lot of scanning vendors try to discern a lot of scanning vendors try to discern a lot of scanning vendors try to discern um vulnerability state on whatever it is um vulnerability state on whatever it is um vulnerability state on whatever it is that they're that they're that they're scanning. So, uh with VEX, the scanning. So, uh with VEX, the scanning. So, uh with VEX, the possibilities truly are almost possibilities truly are almost possibilities truly are almost limitless, right? They're a great source limitless, right? They're a great source limitless, right? They're a great source of vulnerability data that can be used of vulnerability data that can be used of vulnerability data that can be used in a number of different ways. Uh they in a number of different ways. Uh they in a number of different ways. Uh they can be used by scanning vendors again to can be used by scanning vendors again to can be used by scanning vendors again to better surface accurate vulnerability better surface accurate vulnerability better surface accurate vulnerability information. And if you couple that with information. And if you couple that with information. And if you couple that with sbombs, uh you could likely use VEX in a sbombs, uh you could likely use VEX in a sbombs, uh you could likely use VEX in a way that shows patched and unpatched way that shows patched and unpatched way that shows patched and unpatched vulnerabilities even for systems that vulnerabilities even for systems that vulnerabilities even for systems that you don't have immediate access to. Uh you don't have immediate access to. Uh you don't have immediate access to. Uh in fact, I was looking this up, I think in fact, I was looking this up, I think in fact, I was looking this up, I think last week or the week before, and I last week or the week before, and I last week or the week before, and I believe that Trivy can do this already. believe that Trivy can do this already. believe that Trivy can do this already. Not that I'm endorsing Trivia, but they Not that I'm endorsing Trivia, but they Not that I'm endorsing Trivia, but they were an example that does both. Um, and were an example that does both. Um, and were an example that does both. Um, and I'm not sure about other scanners. I I'm not sure about other scanners. I I'm not sure about other scanners. I didn't go looking too far. You can also didn't go looking too far. You can also didn't go looking too far. You can also easily get statistics, easily get statistics, easily get statistics, uh, oversight and other useful uh, oversight and other useful uh, oversight and other useful information using VEX on your systems, information using VEX on your systems, information using VEX on your systems, assuming that your vendor is publishing assuming that your vendor is publishing assuming that your vendor is publishing data in VEX and publishing data for both data in VEX and publishing data for both data in VEX and publishing data for both fixed and unfixed vulnerabilities. That fixed and unfixed vulnerabilities. That fixed and unfixed vulnerabilities. That very important also the unfixed very important also the unfixed very important also the unfixed vulnerabilities that gets you the full vulnerabilities that gets you the full vulnerabilities that gets you the full true representation. true representation. true representation. Now obviously this is up to the vendor Now obviously this is up to the vendor Now obviously this is up to the vendor or the open source project to produce or the open source project to produce or the open source project to produce that information but the possibilities that information but the possibilities that information but the possibilities are definitely there and given that are definitely there and given that are definitely there and given that everyone wants this kind of information everyone wants this kind of information everyone wants this kind of information vendors really should be looking to vendors really should be looking to vendors really should be looking to expose as much of this as possible so expose as much of this as possible so expose as much of this as possible so that their users can make proper that their users can make proper that their users can make proper riskbased decisions on how the software riskbased decisions on how the software riskbased decisions on how the software that they're using is exposed and deployed. And that's all I got. We've deployed. And that's all I got. We've deployed. And that's all I got. We've got about 10 minutes, I think, uh for got about 10 minutes, I think, uh for got about 10 minutes, I think, uh for some Q&amp;A or or more praises. Kidding. some Q&amp;A or or more praises. Kidding. some Q&amp;A or or more praises. Kidding. I'm kidding. Uh definitely more I'm kidding. Uh definitely more I'm kidding. Uh definitely more questions. Um but thank you very much. Yes, sir. Yep. Uh yeah, I can hear you. Does that work? Oh, yes. There you you. Does that work? Oh, yes. There you you. Does that work? Oh, yes. There you go. Cool. Okay. go. Cool. Okay. go. Cool. Okay. So, VEX is for both So, VEX is for both So, VEX is for both vulnerables, CVS that are vulnerable and vulnerables, CVS that are vulnerable and vulnerables, CVS that are vulnerable and those that are not for a product. those that are not for a product. those that are not for a product. Correct. Correct. Okay. Correct. Correct. Okay. Correct. Correct. Okay. So, for customer vulnerability So, for customer vulnerability So, for customer vulnerability management, if one could get a complete If one drop is it still working? A If one drop is it still working? A If one drop is it still working? A complete VEX mic drop. I love it. complete VEX mic drop. I love it. complete VEX mic drop. I love it. If one could get a complete VEX document If one could get a complete VEX document If one could get a complete VEX document from any running uh instance of an from any running uh instance of an from any running uh instance of an application, okay, ask the application application, okay, ask the application application, okay, ask the application for its VEX and it would give it to you. for its VEX and it would give it to you. for its VEX and it would give it to you. Okay. Is there any customer security uh Okay. Is there any customer security uh Okay. Is there any customer security uh benefit at all for getting an SBOM? SBOM? SBOM? Um Um Um maybe I I mean it's it's a little maybe I I mean it's it's a little maybe I I mean it's it's a little challenging, right? Because when you're challenging, right? Because when you're challenging, right? Because when you're looking at like VEX should tell you this looking at like VEX should tell you this looking at like VEX should tell you this CV is applicable to these versions of CV is applicable to these versions of CV is applicable to these versions of this particular software, right? The this particular software, right? The this particular software, right? The SBOM will tell you which version of that SBOM will tell you which version of that SBOM will tell you which version of that software you have. And this is where I software you have. And this is where I software you have. And this is where I kind of think the two are necessary. The kind of think the two are necessary. The kind of think the two are necessary. The SBOM tells you you're running SBOM tells you you're running SBOM tells you you're running application version application version application version XYZ. The VEX will tell you XYZ is XYZ. The VEX will tell you XYZ is XYZ. The VEX will tell you XYZ is vulnerable, not vulnerable, not vulnerable, not vulnerable, or a later version is or vulnerable, or a later version is or vulnerable, or a later version is or not. The VEX doesn't necessarily tell not. The VEX doesn't necessarily tell not. The VEX doesn't necessarily tell you what you have installed, right? So, you what you have installed, right? So, you what you have installed, right? So, keep in mind an SBOM is a point in time. keep in mind an SBOM is a point in time. keep in mind an SBOM is a point in time. When you upgrade the software, you When you upgrade the software, you When you upgrade the software, you should have an upgraded sbomb, but as should have an upgraded sbomb, but as should have an upgraded sbomb, but as long as you're running that application long as you're running that application long as you're running that application and you haven't upgraded any software, and you haven't upgraded any software, and you haven't upgraded any software, that sbomb is valid. That VEX could that sbomb is valid. That VEX could that sbomb is valid. That VEX could change every day depending on when new change every day depending on when new change every day depending on when new vulnerabilities are discovered or not. vulnerabilities are discovered or not. vulnerabilities are discovered or not. Sure. But I was postulating that the Sure. But I was postulating that the Sure. But I was postulating that the running program could give you its VEX. running program could give you its VEX. running program could give you its VEX. In that case, the reason for sbombs In that case, the reason for sbombs In that case, the reason for sbombs right now is to link them to right now is to link them to right now is to link them to CVEes and then No, no. The reason for CVEes and then No, no. The reason for CVEes and then No, no. The reason for sbombs is to let you know what software sbombs is to let you know what software sbombs is to let you know what software you have independent of CVS. The excuse you have independent of CVS. The excuse you have independent of CVS. The excuse me, the vulnerability management reason me, the vulnerability management reason me, the vulnerability management reason for sbombs is to link them to CBES and for sbombs is to link them to CBES and for sbombs is to link them to CBES and every customer I'm aware of. Okay. every customer I'm aware of. Okay. every customer I'm aware of. Okay. I I mean I I I know there's other people I I mean I I I know there's other people I I mean I I I know there's other people that saying you can use it for other that saying you can use it for other that saying you can use it for other things to make purchasing decisions things to make purchasing decisions things to make purchasing decisions because somehow you can figure out from because somehow you can figure out from because somehow you can figure out from the components whether good I was the components whether good I was the components whether good I was talking about vulnerability management. talking about vulnerability management. talking about vulnerability management. Right. But sbombs themselves don't Right. But sbombs themselves don't Right. But sbombs themselves don't contain CVE information. Correct. Right. contain CVE information. Correct. Right. contain CVE information. Correct. Right. But what they're used for is to link But what they're used for is to link But what they're used for is to link them to CVE that allegedly or may be uh them to CVE that allegedly or may be uh them to CVE that allegedly or may be uh uh vulnerabilities in the product. uh vulnerabilities in the product. uh vulnerabilities in the product. Mhm. For vulnerability management. Mhm. For vulnerability management. Mhm. For vulnerability management. Correct. Yeah. Right. I mean, there's Correct. Yeah. Right. I mean, there's Correct. Yeah. Right. I mean, there's other things like license management and other things like license management and other things like license management and and you know, Sure. Yeah. They can also and you know, Sure. Yeah. They can also and you know, Sure. Yeah. They can also give you a heads up if something goes in give you a heads up if something goes in give you a heads up if something goes in the wild that hasn't been issued to CVE the wild that hasn't been issued to CVE the wild that hasn't been issued to CVE yet, gives you early notification. But yet, gives you early notification. But yet, gives you early notification. But if the product could give you its if the product could give you its if the product could give you its up-to-date VEX, then I don't see a up-to-date VEX, then I don't see a up-to-date VEX, then I don't see a reason for sbomb for vulnerability reason for sbomb for vulnerability reason for sbomb for vulnerability management. No, I mean, from from that management. No, I mean, from from that management. No, I mean, from from that perspective, probably not. Um, I don't perspective, probably not. Um, I don't perspective, probably not. Um, I don't think you're going to convince any think you're going to convince any think you're going to convince any customer that, hey, here's my Vex, you customer that, hey, here's my Vex, you customer that, hey, here's my Vex, you don't need Nestbomb. is a lot of them don't need Nestbomb. is a lot of them don't need Nestbomb. is a lot of them are still like, I want an sbomb. Please are still like, I want an sbomb. Please are still like, I want an sbomb. Please give me an S bomb whether I use it or give me an S bomb whether I use it or give me an S bomb whether I use it or not. But I think you're right. You could not. But I think you're right. You could not. But I think you're right. You could use VEX without needing Sbombs at all. use VEX without needing Sbombs at all. use VEX without needing Sbombs at all. And the other thing is that the Okay, so And the other thing is that the Okay, so And the other thing is that the Okay, so that's part one. Part two is uh is there that's part one. Part two is uh is there that's part one. Part two is uh is there some reason that scanning vendors can't some reason that scanning vendors can't some reason that scanning vendors can't produce a VEX document for a product? produce a VEX document for a product? produce a VEX document for a product? They are not experts on the product. No, They are not experts on the product. No, They are not experts on the product. No, no, no. I'm not saying that. Yeah, it's no, no. I'm not saying that. Yeah, it's no, no. I'm not saying that. Yeah, it's it's a technical problem. Sure. But they it's a technical problem. Sure. But they it's a technical problem. Sure. But they could they they they could. But maybe could they they they could. But maybe could they they they could. But maybe I'll just go back to my concern is we get that if we leave it up to is we get that if we leave it up to is we get that if we leave it up to scanning vendors because this is what scanning vendors because this is what scanning vendors because this is what scanning vendors are doing right now, scanning vendors are doing right now, scanning vendors are doing right now, right? So whether they're producing this right? So whether they're producing this right? So whether they're producing this based on their own data and they're based on their own data and they're based on their own data and they're spitting it out into a VEX format or spitting it out into a VEX format or spitting it out into a VEX format or some other format, right? Doesn't some other format, right? Doesn't some other format, right? Doesn't matter. Sure. that it's the non-experts matter. Sure. that it's the non-experts matter. Sure. that it's the non-experts who are putting together that vex data. who are putting together that vex data. who are putting together that vex data. I think that's wrong. It should be the I think that's wrong. It should be the I think that's wrong. It should be the vendors who built the thing, who know vendors who built the thing, who know vendors who built the thing, who know what the vulnerabilities are, who do the what the vulnerabilities are, who do the what the vulnerabilities are, who do the assessments in the context of that assessments in the context of that assessments in the context of that application because otherwise you have application because otherwise you have application because otherwise you have people like NVD who rate the most people like NVD who rate the most people like NVD who rate the most silliest of things as a 9.8 CVS. And I'm silliest of things as a 9.8 CVS. And I'm silliest of things as a 9.8 CVS. And I'm sorry, I just don't think that sorry, I just don't think that sorry, I just don't think that uh these are these are biased third uh these are these are biased third uh these are these are biased third parties or ignorant third parties who parties or ignorant third parties who parties or ignorant third parties who should not be assessing risk for any should not be assessing risk for any should not be assessing risk for any vendor. vendor. vendor. Do you guys have any uh plan for trying Do you guys have any uh plan for trying Do you guys have any uh plan for trying to get the scanning vendors to take your to get the scanning vendors to take your to get the scanning vendors to take your VEX? And could we help you where I work? VEX? And could we help you where I work? VEX? And could we help you where I work? Uh where do you work? Oracle. Uh where do you work? Oracle. Uh where do you work? Oracle. Uh in uh getting that to happen? Yeah, Uh in uh getting that to happen? Yeah, Uh in uh getting that to happen? Yeah, we have a certification program that we we have a certification program that we we have a certification program that we we have for scanning vendors for we have for scanning vendors for we have for scanning vendors for specifically for Red Hat software and specifically for Red Hat software and specifically for Red Hat software and one of the things we're trying to do is one of the things we're trying to do is one of the things we're trying to do is get them to use our VEX. Um, but I mean get them to use our VEX. Um, but I mean get them to use our VEX. Um, but I mean we as part of that if other vendors are we as part of that if other vendors are we as part of that if other vendors are like hey you know as you're scanning our like hey you know as you're scanning our like hey you know as you're scanning our stuff we produce VEX as well. I think stuff we produce VEX as well. I think stuff we produce VEX as well. I think that if enough vendors are providing VEX that if enough vendors are providing VEX that if enough vendors are providing VEX documents then it becomes compelling for documents then it becomes compelling for documents then it becomes compelling for them to use uh as part of their them to use uh as part of their them to use uh as part of their software. Thanks. Thank you. We have a software. Thanks. Thank you. We have a software. Thanks. Thank you. We have a question on Discord. Um, is VEX can VEX question on Discord. Um, is VEX can VEX question on Discord. Um, is VEX can VEX be used to add additional attributes be used to add additional attributes be used to add additional attributes like to oval like to oval like to oval uh to check for example DLL version to uh to check for example DLL version to uh to check for example DLL version to know if some patches have been applied know if some patches have been applied know if some patches have been applied or not? I believe uh I can't speak for or not? I believe uh I can't speak for or not? I believe uh I can't speak for openvax. I believe cesvex you can extend openvax. I believe cesvex you can extend openvax. I believe cesvex you can extend it uh as well. Now I don't know what it uh as well. Now I don't know what it uh as well. Now I don't know what that means in terms of like the prior that means in terms of like the prior that means in terms of like the prior questions around scanning vendors. they questions around scanning vendors. they questions around scanning vendors. they may not understand or like the may not understand or like the may not understand or like the extensions that go on there, but I extensions that go on there, but I extensions that go on there, but I believe you can extend uh CESAP VEX believe you can extend uh CESAP VEX believe you can extend uh CESAP VEX anyways in certain ways uh probably in a anyways in certain ways uh probably in a anyways in certain ways uh probably in a way that would satisfy that answer. way that would satisfy that answer. way that would satisfy that answer.

What's your thoughts about the the burden that will be put on the open the burden that will be put on the open the burden that will be put on the open source maintainers source maintainers source maintainers to prepare the vax information because to prepare the vax information because to prepare the vax information because currently like it's it will be expected currently like it's it will be expected currently like it's it will be expected from open source people to produce the from open source people to produce the from open source people to produce the vaxes and we have volunteers only like vaxes and we have volunteers only like vaxes and we have volunteers only like in our case and we are experts in our in our case and we are experts in our in our case and we are experts in our project yes and we can analyze and project yes and we can analyze and project yes and we can analyze and respond to CVS uh which are reported to respond to CVS uh which are reported to respond to CVS uh which are reported to us but we have like airflow has like 700 us but we have like airflow has like 700 us but we have like airflow has like 700 dependencies. Yeah. So, and we are not dependencies. Yeah. So, and we are not dependencies. Yeah. So, and we are not experts in those. So, how can we assess experts in those. So, how can we assess experts in those. So, how can we assess and what the industry can do to help us and what the industry can do to help us and what the industry can do to help us with assessing the uh actually to with assessing the uh actually to with assessing the uh actually to produce the vacc or we are invulnerable because vacc or we are invulnerable because vacc or we are invulnerable because otherwise like I have a CV in those 700 otherwise like I have a CV in those 700 otherwise like I have a CV in those 700 dependencies every two hours more or dependencies every two hours more or dependencies every two hours more or less. Yeah. I I think I mean for one I less. Yeah. I I think I mean for one I less. Yeah. I I think I mean for one I don't think you can mandate open source don't think you can mandate open source don't think you can mandate open source does anything that's the beauty of open does anything that's the beauty of open does anything that's the beauty of open source right um I do think that there source right um I do think that there source right um I do think that there are ways to uh provide tooling for open are ways to uh provide tooling for open are ways to uh provide tooling for open source communities to be able to do this source communities to be able to do this source communities to be able to do this most open- source um communities have most open- source um communities have most open- source um communities have like a website with like known like a website with like known like a website with like known vulnerabilities or whatnot displayed on vulnerabilities or whatnot displayed on vulnerabilities or whatnot displayed on there if we could have a tool that make there if we could have a tool that make there if we could have a tool that make it very easy for them to produce that it very easy for them to produce that it very easy for them to produce that maybe as part of a git workflow or maybe as part of a git workflow or maybe as part of a git workflow or something like that um that information something like that um that information something like that um that information could be made accessible. Uh but I don't could be made accessible. Uh but I don't could be made accessible. Uh but I don't know what that that looks like. I know know what that that looks like. I know know what that that looks like. I know that there are some CRA and you know that there are some CRA and you know that there are some CRA and you know things like that who are like pushing things like that who are like pushing things like that who are like pushing for these things but I mean at the end for these things but I mean at the end for these things but I mean at the end of the day CRA can't mandate any of that of the day CRA can't mandate any of that of the day CRA can't mandate any of that stuff to Bob the open source developer stuff to Bob the open source developer stuff to Bob the open source developer right it they should do that but not right it they should do that but not right it they should do that but not because they're being mandated to by a because they're being mandated to by a because they're being mandated to by a government entity and we just have to government entity and we just have to government entity and we just have to make it easy for them to do.
