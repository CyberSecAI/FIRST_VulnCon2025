Kind: captions Language: en Um, thank you everybody for joining Um, thank you everybody for joining Um, thank you everybody for joining today and thank you to the uh the crew today and thank you to the uh the crew today and thank you to the uh the crew that just helped us through that. Um, that just helped us through that. Um, that just helped us through that. Um, today we're going to be talking about today we're going to be talking about today we're going to be talking about really looking at the power of the really looking at the power of the really looking at the power of the ESBOM. What does the ESBOM tell us? How ESBOM. What does the ESBOM tell us? How ESBOM. What does the ESBOM tell us? How do we take that information? How do we do we take that information? How do we do we take that information? How do we then manage then manage then manage um really cyber security risk from that? um really cyber security risk from that? um really cyber security risk from that? Um, yesterday at the beginning there was Um, yesterday at the beginning there was Um, yesterday at the beginning there was a great presentation on practical sbomb a great presentation on practical sbomb a great presentation on practical sbomb building. Um, and I believe it was uh building. Um, and I believe it was uh building. Um, and I believe it was uh Ian from Loheed Martin and Michael from Ian from Loheed Martin and Michael from Ian from Loheed Martin and Michael from Kusari and they both said an Sbomb in a Kusari and they both said an Sbomb in a Kusari and they both said an Sbomb in a bucket is completely useless. Um, I bucket is completely useless. Um, I bucket is completely useless. Um, I thought it was good. It it couldn't be thought it was good. It it couldn't be thought it was good. It it couldn't be more true. Right. So you get a lot of more true. Right. So you get a lot of more true. Right. So you get a lot of organizations that may want Sbombs for organizations that may want Sbombs for organizations that may want Sbombs for um procurement reasons. They just throw um procurement reasons. They just throw um procurement reasons. They just throw it in a bucket. So, what we're going to it in a bucket. So, what we're going to it in a bucket. So, what we're going to do today is talk about how you take that do today is talk about how you take that do today is talk about how you take that information, actually do something with information, actually do something with information, actually do something with it and how we um work with our vendors it and how we um work with our vendors it and how we um work with our vendors and suppliers to really manage risk and suppliers to really manage risk and suppliers to really manage risk inside of inside of inside of IBM. IBM. IBM. Um so, just a quick the IBM legal team Um so, just a quick the IBM legal team Um so, just a quick the IBM legal team wanted us to have this standard wanted us to have this standard wanted us to have this standard disclaimer basically saying this is all disclaimer basically saying this is all disclaimer basically saying this is all presented on an ASIS basis. No presented on an ASIS basis. No presented on an ASIS basis. No warranties. IBM will not be liable for warranties. IBM will not be liable for warranties.

Um, I have been with security office. Um, I have been with security office. Um, I have been with IBM for over 20 years. I've been in this IBM for over 20 years. I've been in this IBM for over 20 years. I've been in this particular role now for coming up on particular role now for coming up on particular role now for coming up on three years. Um, and essentially my three years. Um, and essentially my three years. Um, and essentially my every day is I'm I'm dealing with every day is I'm I'm dealing with every day is I'm I'm dealing with sbombs, right? I'm I'm receiving them. sbombs, right? I'm I'm receiving them. sbombs, right? I'm I'm receiving them. I'm producing them. I'm analyzing. That I'm producing them. I'm analyzing. That I'm producing them. I'm analyzing. That is kind of my world. is kind of my world. is kind of my world. Thank you, John. Hi, I'm Zardia Alden. Thank you, John. Hi, I'm Zardia Alden. Thank you, John. Hi, I'm Zardia Alden. So, I'm based out of the UK. Um, coming So, I'm based out of the UK. Um, coming So, I'm based out of the UK. Um, coming up nearly 30 years in IBM and in the up nearly 30 years in IBM and in the up nearly 30 years in IBM and in the last couple of years, couple of years in last couple of years, couple of years in last couple of years, couple of years in the CISO office. Prior to that, it was the CISO office. Prior to that, it was the CISO office. Prior to that, it was from the open source program office from the open source program office from the open source program office primarily looking at legal and license primarily looking at legal and license primarily looking at legal and license compliance and then more recently in the compliance and then more recently in the compliance and then more recently in the last two years, it's looking at the last two years, it's looking at the last two years, it's looking at the cyber security um through ESBOM cyber security um through ESBOM cyber security um through ESBOM analysis. Okay. So for the um agenda today, so um Okay. So for the um agenda today, so um Okay. So for the um agenda today, so um firstly um some business context around firstly um some business context around firstly um some business context around we why we do ESBOM analysis. So as a we why we do ESBOM analysis. So as a we why we do ESBOM analysis. So as a consumer and also as a provider. Uh consumer and also as a provider. Uh consumer and also as a provider. Uh we'll talk about vulnerability we'll talk about vulnerability we'll talk about vulnerability assessment as a whole, the analysis and assessment as a whole, the analysis and assessment as a whole, the analysis and the insights that we're finding. Um the the insights that we're finding. Um the the insights that we're finding. Um the approach we take to the SBOM analysis approach we take to the SBOM analysis approach we take to the SBOM analysis and also the automation we've applied to and also the automation we've applied to and also the automation we've applied to help streamline the help streamline the help streamline the assessment. some of the challenges we we assessment. some of the challenges we we assessment. some of the challenges we we see in um sharing that information and see in um sharing that information and see in um sharing that information and also remediation with our suppliers and also remediation with our suppliers and also remediation with our suppliers and our vendors and then I will talk a our vendors and then I will talk a our vendors and then I will talk a little bit more about um some of the little bit more about um some of the little bit more about um some of the trends and the patterns we're seeing trends and the patterns we're seeing trends and the patterns we're seeing with ESBOM noise and then how we can with ESBOM noise and then how we can with ESBOM noise and then how we can improve the accuracy of the ESBOM improve the accuracy of the ESBOM improve the accuracy of the ESBOM content and then just finally conclude content and then just finally conclude content and then just finally conclude with key takeaways and then open it up with key takeaways and then open it up with key takeaways and then open it up for Q&amp;A. Okay. So I'm going to assume and I think Okay. So I'm going to assume and I think Okay. So I'm going to assume and I think it's probably a fair assumption at this it's probably a fair assumption at this it's probably a fair assumption at this conference that everybody in this room conference that everybody in this room conference that everybody in this room knows very well what an ESBOM is and knows very well what an ESBOM is and knows very well what an ESBOM is and it's all about transparency right what it's all about transparency right what it's all about transparency right what are the components what are the are the components what are the are the components what are the dependencies the libraries that are dependencies the libraries that are dependencies the libraries that are really the ingredients of the really the ingredients of the really the ingredients of the software and um you know how critical software and um you know how critical software and um you know how critical this knowing this is for really managing this knowing this is for really managing this knowing this is for really managing cyber security and supply chain security cyber security and supply chain security cyber security and supply chain security risk risk risk um you know as we um you know as we um you know as we see the the current environment really see the the current environment really see the the current environment really driven driven driven by I think regulatory mandates, security by I think regulatory mandates, security by I think regulatory mandates, security directives worldwide. Um starting with directives worldwide. Um starting with directives worldwide. Um starting with of course the Biden executive order in of course the Biden executive order in of course the Biden executive order in in May of 2020 21 um you know more in May of 2020 21 um you know more in May of 2020 21 um you know more recently in Europe now with the the recently in Europe now with the the recently in Europe now with the the different the NIS directive um CRA different the NIS directive um CRA different the NIS directive um CRA coming into full force in coming into full force in coming into full force in 2027. This is the regulatory 2027. This is the regulatory 2027. This is the regulatory um and and compliance framework that um and and compliance framework that um and and compliance framework that we're working within and this is we're working within and this is we're working within and this is absolutely driving increasing absolutely driving increasing absolutely driving increasing transparency. Keep in mind the transparency. Keep in mind the transparency. Keep in mind the ESBOM standards um are continuing to ESBOM standards um are continuing to ESBOM standards um are continuing to mature and evolve um as is the tooling mature and evolve um as is the tooling mature and evolve um as is the tooling the ability to to take this information the ability to to take this information the ability to to take this information and operationalize it is all continuing and operationalize it is all continuing and operationalize it is all continuing to mature. So really the net of this is to mature. So really the net of this is to mature. So really the net of this is it's pretty pretty tricky navigating it's pretty pretty tricky navigating it's pretty pretty tricky navigating esbombs right now in the corporate esbombs right now in the corporate esbombs right now in the corporate environment, right? You've got to be environment, right? You've got to be environment, right? You've got to be dealing with all the increasing dealing with all the increasing dealing with all the increasing compliance, the transparency needs um as compliance, the transparency needs um as compliance, the transparency needs um as the tooling for sbombs it's is improving the tooling for sbombs it's is improving the tooling for sbombs it's is improving um maturing. It's the the constant need um maturing. It's the the constant need um maturing. It's the the constant need to go back revisit the tooling the to go back revisit the tooling the to go back revisit the tooling the processes and keep coming back and processes and keep coming back and processes and keep coming back and revisiting your security strategies. Thank thanks John. Okay. So a couple of Thank thanks John. Okay. So a couple of Thank thanks John. Okay. So a couple of the use cases uh for um sbomb analysis. the use cases uh for um sbomb analysis. the use cases uh for um sbomb analysis. So one as a consumer of um software. So So one as a consumer of um software. So So one as a consumer of um software. So we work with a lot of OEM and vendors we work with a lot of OEM and vendors we work with a lot of OEM and vendors and software suppliers. So we want to and software suppliers. So we want to and software suppliers. So we want to look at their sbombs and understand look at their sbombs and understand look at their sbombs and understand their security posture. We also work their security posture. We also work their security posture. We also work with the mergers M&amp;A team on inbound with the mergers M&amp;A team on inbound with the mergers M&amp;A team on inbound acquisitions. So again doing code scans acquisitions. So again doing code scans acquisitions. So again doing code scans and reviewing the SBOM output from those and reviewing the SBOM output from those and reviewing the SBOM output from those scans. And then obviously as a provider scans. And then obviously as a provider scans. And then obviously as a provider of software uh in IBM. So also trying to of software uh in IBM. So also trying to of software uh in IBM. So also trying to identify our own components for your identify our own components for your identify our own components for your esbomb analysis, any remediation plans esbomb analysis, any remediation plans esbomb analysis, any remediation plans and insight into aging libraries that we and insight into aging libraries that we and insight into aging libraries that we see from the ESBOM analysis results. see from the ESBOM analysis results. see from the ESBOM analysis results. Do you want to speak to the the Yes, Do you want to speak to the the Yes, Do you want to speak to the the Yes, you're right. Yeah, thanks John. The the you're right. Yeah, thanks John. The the you're right. Yeah, thanks John. The the stat over here. So the chart here just stat over here. So the chart here just stat over here. So the chart here just shows the trend we've seen since 2022. shows the trend we've seen since 2022. shows the trend we've seen since 2022. So that number there equates to the So that number there equates to the So that number there equates to the number of unique sbombs that have been number of unique sbombs that have been number of unique sbombs that have been analyzed by the program office here. analyzed by the program office here. analyzed by the program office here. Quite significant. Quite significant. Quite significant. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Um, okay. So, so looking at the sbomb Um, okay. So, so looking at the sbomb Um, okay. So, so looking at the sbomb and and we like to laugh because I think and and we like to laugh because I think and and we like to laugh because I think you know when you present an sbomb to an you know when you present an sbomb to an you know when you present an sbomb to an organization or we receive organization or we receive organization or we receive one it really tells all right and it's one it really tells all right and it's one it really tells all right and it's thinking about what does it say about thinking about what does it say about thinking about what does it say about you know not only your your offering so you know not only your your offering so you know not only your your offering so security posture but potentially your security posture but potentially your security posture but potentially your software practices your vulnerability software practices your vulnerability software practices your vulnerability management practices and what's this management practices and what's this management practices and what's this really say about your overall really say about your overall really say about your overall organization Um so most obviously the organization Um so most obviously the organization Um so most obviously the ESBOM gives the ability to scan for ESBOM gives the ability to scan for ESBOM gives the ability to scan for vulnerabilities open- source packages we vulnerabilities open- source packages we vulnerabilities open- source packages we found at least for example dependency found at least for example dependency found at least for example dependency track uh men prisma cloud twist lock track uh men prisma cloud twist lock track uh men prisma cloud twist lock these are all excellent tools that that these are all excellent tools that that these are all excellent tools that that so far we've um found very to be to be so far we've um found very to be to be so far we've um found very to be to be very useful. Um, additionally, you know, very useful. Um, additionally, you know, very useful. Um, additionally, you know, beyond just the vulnerabilities, we at beyond just the vulnerabilities, we at beyond just the vulnerabilities, we at IBM are putting a very strong emphasis IBM are putting a very strong emphasis IBM are putting a very strong emphasis on looking at the percentages of what on looking at the percentages of what on looking at the percentages of what are your packages are at the latest are your packages are at the latest are your packages are at the latest release level, what's potentially back release level, what's potentially back release level, what's potentially back level, and then even what's the level, and then even what's the level, and then even what's the percentage where we're not able to get a percentage where we're not able to get a percentage where we're not able to get a read. Um, looking at the back level, for read. Um, looking at the back level, for read. Um, looking at the back level, for example, the the emphasis there is example, the the emphasis there is example, the the emphasis there is obviously for one, your your latest open obviously for one, your your latest open obviously for one, your your latest open source library releases, they're going source library releases, they're going source library releases, they're going to have all the latest security to have all the latest security to have all the latest security pageantss. pageantss. pageantss. Um, two, if if we're not if they're not Um, two, if if we're not if they're not Um, two, if if we're not if they're not even up to the latest date, we're not even up to the latest date, we're not even up to the latest date, we're not even obviously scanning that. If there even obviously scanning that. If there even obviously scanning that. If there are newer vulnerabilities, that's a gap. are newer vulnerabilities, that's a gap. are newer vulnerabilities, that's a gap. We're not even seeing it. We're not even seeing it. We're not even seeing it. Um, Um, Um, additionally, if there's a large additionally, if there's a large additionally, if there's a large percentage within the ESBOM analysis percentage within the ESBOM analysis percentage within the ESBOM analysis that we're not even able to tell if it's that we're not even able to tell if it's that we're not even able to tell if it's back level or not, that might be a very back level or not, that might be a very back level or not, that might be a very clear indication that we're not within clear indication that we're not within clear indication that we're not within the ESBOM, uh, maybe there aren't the the ESBOM, uh, maybe there aren't the the ESBOM, uh, maybe there aren't the sufficient unique identifiers, pearls, sufficient unique identifiers, pearls, sufficient unique identifiers, pearls, CPEs, maybe they're missing and it needs CPEs, maybe they're missing and it needs CPEs, maybe they're missing and it needs closer examination. closer examination. closer examination. An interesting An interesting An interesting statistic and this is something why we statistic and this is something why we statistic and this is something why we we continue to focus on this area we continue to focus on this area we continue to focus on this area heavily. We did an internal analysis in heavily. We did an internal analysis in heavily. We did an internal analysis in IBM and found that literally 80% of the IBM and found that literally 80% of the IBM and found that literally 80% of the vulnerabilities vulnerabilities vulnerabilities identified could be immediately identified could be immediately identified could be immediately addressed if all of the open- source addressed if all of the open- source addressed if all of the open- source libraries being used were simply up to libraries being used were simply up to libraries being used were simply up to the latest level 80%. the latest level 80%. the latest level 80%. Um and Zia will speak too. I mean there Um and Zia will speak too. I mean there Um and Zia will speak too. I mean there there are certainly tools and abilities there are certainly tools and abilities there are certainly tools and abilities to to to bring those libraries to that to to to bring those libraries to that to to to bring those libraries to that latest level. Um and of course you know latest level. Um and of course you know latest level. Um and of course you know we we are also scanning for obviously we we are also scanning for obviously we we are also scanning for obviously the the vanity vulnerabilities in the the the vanity vulnerabilities in the the the vanity vulnerabilities in the case for example log forj it's not just case for example log forj it's not just case for example log forj it's not just are we finding it but then we have are we finding it but then we have are we finding it but then we have internal abilities or or looking you internal abilities or or looking you internal abilities or or looking you know as we analyze sbombs from vendors know as we analyze sbombs from vendors know as we analyze sbombs from vendors how pervasive is it through the offering how pervasive is it through the offering how pervasive is it through the offering um and to what extent is this really a um and to what extent is this really a um and to what extent is this really a risk and all of this helps really to risk and all of this helps really to risk and all of this helps really to prioritize the remediation and prioritize the remediation and prioritize the remediation and prioritize the areas of risk that we're prioritize the areas of risk that we're prioritize the areas of risk that we're looking looking looking at um so a bit of a deeper dive into at um so a bit of a deeper dive into at um so a bit of a deeper dive into what we're looking at. So with with a what we're looking at. So with with a what we're looking at. So with with a given given given particular CVE for example on the left particular CVE for example on the left particular CVE for example on the left we're first you know focusing on the we're first you know focusing on the we're first you know focusing on the severity right um you know in the case severity right um you know in the case severity right um you know in the case of of Zia as we were talking about our of of Zia as we were talking about our of of Zia as we were talking about our primary use case for what we're talking primary use case for what we're talking primary use case for what we're talking about today is thinking as a consumer of about today is thinking as a consumer of about today is thinking as a consumer of sbombs the quality so what are we seeing sbombs the quality so what are we seeing sbombs the quality so what are we seeing in severity anything with criticals and in severity anything with criticals and in severity anything with criticals and highs that needs remediation before highs that needs remediation before highs that needs remediation before we're going to be willing to accept it we're going to be willing to accept it we're going to be willing to accept it um you know something that I'm sure many um you know something that I'm sure many um you know something that I'm sure many of you are also experiencing of you are also experiencing of you are also experiencing uh particularly with with using say NVD uh particularly with with using say NVD uh particularly with with using say NVD if that's our primary source of scoring if that's our primary source of scoring if that's our primary source of scoring and severity is the everinccreasing and severity is the everinccreasing and severity is the everinccreasing number of unassigned vulnerabilities. number of unassigned vulnerabilities. number of unassigned vulnerabilities. This is due to the backlog. Um it's been This is due to the backlog. Um it's been This is due to the backlog. Um it's been really encouraging here today and really encouraging here today and really encouraging here today and yesterday to hear all the different yesterday to hear all the different yesterday to hear all the different efforts that are going to uh improve um efforts that are going to uh improve um efforts that are going to uh improve um within CBE information and um for within CBE information and um for within CBE information and um for example I think we attended a talk example I think we attended a talk example I think we attended a talk earlier today where Jerry was talking earlier today where Jerry was talking earlier today where Jerry was talking about he believes that CVSS score should about he believes that CVSS score should about he believes that CVSS score should absolutely be a required uh field. So absolutely be a required uh field. So absolutely be a required uh field. So but that that issue of unassigned but that that issue of unassigned but that that issue of unassigned severity is is something that's a severity is is something that's a severity is is something that's a challenge and of course it makes us then challenge and of course it makes us then challenge and of course it makes us then to look to many different sources for to look to many different sources for to look to many different sources for information. information. information. um the age of the um the age of the um the age of the CVE. What is this telling us CVE. What is this telling us CVE. What is this telling us um in terms of how long has the um in terms of how long has the um in terms of how long has the vulnerability been known about? Does vulnerability been known about? Does vulnerability been known about? Does this imply that the organization sending this imply that the organization sending this imply that the organization sending us the SBOM, the vendor, they're just us the SBOM, the vendor, they're just us the SBOM, the vendor, they're just not fixing it, right? They just don't not fixing it, right? They just don't not fixing it, right? They just don't they don't have the ability to fix it, they don't have the ability to fix it, they don't have the ability to fix it, or might this be an indication of or might this be an indication of or might this be an indication of something that's been fixed, but there's something that's been fixed, but there's something that's been fixed, but there's a legacy vulnerability that potentially a legacy vulnerability that potentially a legacy vulnerability that potentially could be resurfacing. Um but that's could be resurfacing. Um but that's could be resurfacing. Um but that's certainly something the ones that are certainly something the ones that are certainly something the ones that are really old they they pop out and and really old they they pop out and and really old they they pop out and and they require special attention. Um and they require special attention. Um and they require special attention. Um and then of course the Kev association if then of course the Kev association if then of course the Kev association if any CVEEs are are associated there that any CVEEs are are associated there that any CVEEs are are associated there that is an indicator that this has been a is an indicator that this has been a is an indicator that this has been a realworld vulnerability that that's been realworld vulnerability that that's been realworld vulnerability that that's been exploited. So those those also we're exploited. So those those also we're exploited. So those those also we're we're you know very quickly able to find we're you know very quickly able to find we're you know very quickly able to find out all of that information. Um, in out all of that information. Um, in out all of that information. Um, in terms of version, as we talked about, is terms of version, as we talked about, is terms of version, as we talked about, is something back level and not just one or something back level and not just one or something back level and not just one or two revs back level, but is it two revs back level, but is it two revs back level, but is it significantly back level? What is this significantly back level? What is this significantly back level? What is this telling us? And might that be an telling us? And might that be an telling us? And might that be an indicator that it's either deprecated or indicator that it's either deprecated or indicator that it's either deprecated or totally out of support? Um, and again, totally out of support? Um, and again, totally out of support? Um, and again, it was encouraging. We just had a it was encouraging. We just had a it was encouraging. We just had a session here talking about newer session here talking about newer session here talking about newer standards that will then really validate standards that will then really validate standards that will then really validate within open source libraries what is within open source libraries what is within open source libraries what is truly out of support and how to define truly out of support and how to define truly out of support and how to define that. Um, but that's a big area that that. Um, but that's a big area that that. Um, but that's a big area that we're we're obviously trying to flag and we're we're obviously trying to flag and we're we're obviously trying to flag and identify any of those identify any of those identify any of those libraries. libraries. libraries. Oops. Um, so Zadia highlighted that Oops. Um, so Zadia highlighted that Oops. Um, so Zadia highlighted that statistic that shows just the statistic that shows just the statistic that shows just the exponential growth in sbombs as we as a exponential growth in sbombs as we as a exponential growth in sbombs as we as a supplier um or as a as a consumer what supplier um or as a as a consumer what supplier um or as a as a consumer what we're dealing with in terms of we're dealing with in terms of we're dealing with in terms of processing. Um, so the key to that all processing. Um, so the key to that all processing. Um, so the key to that all is really how do we keep up with it? how is really how do we keep up with it? how is really how do we keep up with it? how do we scale and in terms of automation. do we scale and in terms of automation. do we scale and in terms of automation. So initially this is a little bit of a So initially this is a little bit of a So initially this is a little bit of a view of you know some of the view of you know some of the view of you know some of the architectural components and how we're architectural components and how we're architectural components and how we're doing this. So on the left we've got you doing this. So on the left we've got you doing this. So on the left we've got you know the incoming sbombs. These could be know the incoming sbombs. These could be know the incoming sbombs. These could be from thirdparty suppliers, vendors, what from thirdparty suppliers, vendors, what from thirdparty suppliers, vendors, what we call OEMs or or our intellectual we call OEMs or or our intellectual we call OEMs or or our intellectual property partners that are selling property partners that are selling property partners that are selling software under IBM. All of this needs software under IBM. All of this needs software under IBM. All of this needs careful scrutiny um including if we're careful scrutiny um including if we're careful scrutiny um including if we're doing maybe a merger or an acquisition. doing maybe a merger or an acquisition. doing maybe a merger or an acquisition. Um, we bring all this into a a platform, Um, we bring all this into a a platform, Um, we bring all this into a a platform, essentially tooling that does the essentially tooling that does the essentially tooling that does the analysis. Um, I've cited some of those. analysis. Um, I've cited some of those. analysis. Um, I've cited some of those. Um, and then we take all of that data Um, and then we take all of that data Um, and then we take all of that data and we aggregate it. So, you know, what and we aggregate it. So, you know, what and we aggregate it. So, you know, what are the CVEes, what's their severity, are the CVEes, what's their severity, are the CVEes, what's their severity, what's the the different percentage of what's the the different percentage of what's the the different percentage of back level breakdown, what are the CWEs back level breakdown, what are the CWEs back level breakdown, what are the CWEs and what are the Kev associated uh and what are the Kev associated uh and what are the Kev associated uh CVEEs. We bring all that and then in an CVEEs. We bring all that and then in an CVEEs. We bring all that and then in an automated manner at the far right we automated manner at the far right we automated manner at the far right we produce a nice it's a report it's a produce a nice it's a report it's a produce a nice it's a report it's a standardized report I mean customized to standardized report I mean customized to standardized report I mean customized to to each and every say vendor um but it's to each and every say vendor um but it's to each and every say vendor um but it's it's standard and it's actually it's standard and it's actually it's standard and it's actually generated in a very businessfriendly generated in a very businessfriendly generated in a very businessfriendly format so that when needed and when format so that when needed and when format so that when needed and when appropriate can go right up to the top appropriate can go right up to the top appropriate can go right up to the top executives they understand it as well as executives they understand it as well as executives they understand it as well as then it's got all the technical security then it's got all the technical security then it's got all the technical security detail for the more technical audience. detail for the more technical audience. detail for the more technical audience. Um we're also generating Um we're also generating Um we're also generating um a VEX spreadsheet or VEX template um a VEX spreadsheet or VEX template um a VEX spreadsheet or VEX template I'll call it. So I'll call it. So I'll call it. So it's and and maybe you know with all the it's and and maybe you know with all the it's and and maybe you know with all the different talks here so far maybe people different talks here so far maybe people different talks here so far maybe people are thinking why are you not just going are thinking why are you not just going are thinking why are you not just going right to VEX? What the real world um right to VEX? What the real world um right to VEX? What the real world um most of the vendors that we're working most of the vendors that we're working most of the vendors that we're working with they're in no way ready to receive with they're in no way ready to receive with they're in no way ready to receive just pure VEX output and work with it. just pure VEX output and work with it. just pure VEX output and work with it. That's the reality. but they love That's the reality. but they love That's the reality. but they love spreadsheets. They love to be able to spreadsheets. They love to be able to spreadsheets. They love to be able to see it visually. We want the see it visually. We want the see it visually. We want the standardization. So, what we're doing by standardization. So, what we're doing by standardization. So, what we're doing by this VEX template, we're laying it out this VEX template, we're laying it out this VEX template, we're laying it out very clearly. We're giving them all a very clearly. We're giving them all a very clearly. We're giving them all a dropdown so that they're actually dropdown so that they're actually dropdown so that they're actually answering then the status of the answering then the status of the answering then the status of the vulnerabilities in a VEX standard and vulnerabilities in a VEX standard and vulnerabilities in a VEX standard and then we can take that information and then we can take that information and then we can take that information and process it all according to VEX process it all according to VEX process it all according to VEX standards, but making it visually uh standards, but making it visually uh standards, but making it visually uh easy for them to work with when they may easy for them to work with when they may easy for them to work with when they may not be as familiar with. then we've seen not be as familiar with. then we've seen not be as familiar with. then we've seen tremendous success with that in tremendous success with that in tremendous success with that in standardization. So all of that has been standardization. So all of that has been standardization. So all of that has been significantly automated and really we've significantly automated and really we've significantly automated and really we've we've reduced the time to produce all we've reduced the time to produce all we've reduced the time to produce all this you know as Z will site like 95% this you know as Z will site like 95% this you know as Z will site like 95% reduction in time due to automation. reduction in time due to automation. reduction in time due to automation. Now, so all of that is great, right? Now, so all of that is great, right? Now, so all of that is great, right? We're much faster at producing this. Um, We're much faster at producing this. Um, We're much faster at producing this. Um, what I almost wanted to draw here what I almost wanted to draw here what I almost wanted to draw here was like the coyote and the roadrunner was like the coyote and the roadrunner was like the coyote and the roadrunner running toward the edge of the cliff. running toward the edge of the cliff. running toward the edge of the cliff. Um, but what we're dealing with here is Um, but what we're dealing with here is Um, but what we're dealing with here is the challenge is so we as IBM, we can the challenge is so we as IBM, we can the challenge is so we as IBM, we can generate all that information. And generate all that information. And generate all that information. And that's great. But as we're doing much that's great. But as we're doing much that's great. But as we're doing much more um and we've, you know, we're more um and we've, you know, we're more um and we've, you know, we're increasing the the number of sbombs that increasing the the number of sbombs that increasing the the number of sbombs that we're analyzing concurrently, the number we're analyzing concurrently, the number we're analyzing concurrently, the number of vendors, the number of of, you know, of vendors, the number of of, you know, of vendors, the number of of, you know, what we're processing, that's all what we're processing, that's all what we're processing, that's all increasing concurrently. And the increasing concurrently. And the increasing concurrently. And the question then becomes, how do we share question then becomes, how do we share question then becomes, how do we share that information securely, efficiently, that information securely, efficiently, that information securely, efficiently, and getting all the data back in and getting all the data back in and getting all the data back in standard ways? And that is a an standard ways? And that is a an standard ways? And that is a an everinccreasing challenge. So you know everinccreasing challenge. So you know everinccreasing challenge. So you know dealing with the secure transport this dealing with the secure transport this dealing with the secure transport this is obviously super confidential is obviously super confidential is obviously super confidential information from both vendors and our information from both vendors and our information from both vendors and our analysis analysis analysis um doing it in an efficient way so that um doing it in an efficient way so that um doing it in an efficient way so that it's not too much you know human time it's not too much you know human time it's not too much you know human time involved in those communications and involved in those communications and involved in those communications and then thinking about the constant then thinking about the constant then thinking about the constant iterations right we've pointed out the iterations right we've pointed out the iterations right we've pointed out the vulnerabilities but before we're willing vulnerabilities but before we're willing vulnerabilities but before we're willing to accept that oh I fixed that we want to accept that oh I fixed that we want to accept that oh I fixed that we want you know we want evidence we need to to you know we want evidence we need to to you know we want evidence we need to to reprocess for example that bomb. So, how reprocess for example that bomb. So, how reprocess for example that bomb. So, how to do that iterative remediation to do that iterative remediation to do that iterative remediation um effectively and still be able to um effectively and still be able to um effectively and still be able to continue to scale. So, we know that continue to scale. So, we know that continue to scale. So, we know that there there there are platforms out there that deal with I are platforms out there that deal with I are platforms out there that deal with I think exactly this issue. We've we've think exactly this issue. We've we've think exactly this issue. We've we've had a chance we've s we've talked to had a chance we've s we've talked to had a chance we've s we've talked to some so far. I think Sibes for example, some so far. I think Sibes for example, some so far. I think Sibes for example, Fossa's out there, others. Fossa's out there, others. Fossa's out there, others. Um this is something we'd welcome with Um this is something we'd welcome with Um this is something we'd welcome with the audience that we really if you know the audience that we really if you know the audience that we really if you know many of you may be dealing with this many of you may be dealing with this many of you may be dealing with this same exact issue. Uh we would welcome same exact issue. Uh we would welcome same exact issue. Uh we would welcome the discussion to learn sort of what the discussion to learn sort of what the discussion to learn sort of what what have people have had success with. what have people have had success with. what have people have had success with. Um but I I mean I know that it's it's Um but I I mean I know that it's it's Um but I I mean I know that it's it's encouraging now to see the capabilities encouraging now to see the capabilities encouraging now to see the capabilities from commercial offerings. Um and this from commercial offerings. Um and this from commercial offerings. Um and this is a very real world challenge. Thank you John. And thank you Valerie Thank you John. And thank you Valerie Thank you John. And thank you Valerie for the time check. I think we're good for the time check. I think we're good for the time check. I think we're good for time. Um, okay. So, uh, here I'm for time. Um, okay. So, uh, here I'm for time. Um, okay. So, uh, here I'm going to talk about some of the trends going to talk about some of the trends going to talk about some of the trends and the patterns we're seeing, um, which and the patterns we're seeing, um, which and the patterns we're seeing, um, which I call sbomb noise. Um, so what do I I call sbomb noise. Um, so what do I I call sbomb noise. Um, so what do I mean by sbomb noise? So it's it's mean by sbomb noise? So it's it's mean by sbomb noise? So it's it's components that make it they make their components that make it they make their components that make it they make their way into the sbomb that actually don't way into the sbomb that actually don't way into the sbomb that actually don't make up the production code or um, into make up the production code or um, into make up the production code or um, into the product. Um, so it's noise and it's the product. Um, so it's noise and it's the product. Um, so it's noise and it's actually a distraction on where dev need actually a distraction on where dev need actually a distraction on where dev need to focus their efforts. Okay. So, to focus their efforts. Okay. So, to focus their efforts. Okay. So, starting over here at the bottom. So, starting over here at the bottom. So, starting over here at the bottom. So, nonp production code. So, of the um nonp production code. So, of the um nonp production code. So, of the um sbombs that we've analy an analyzed to sbombs that we've analy an analyzed to sbombs that we've analy an analyzed to date, 22% of those we're seeing date, 22% of those we're seeing date, 22% of those we're seeing nonproduction code making its way into nonproduction code making its way into nonproduction code making its way into the sbomb. So, non-production code. So, the sbomb. So, non-production code. So, the sbomb. So, non-production code. So, these are findings coming from package these are findings coming from package these are findings coming from package manager files. So, requirements.ext manager files. So, requirements.ext manager files. So, requirements.ext pom.xmls. Um and those dependencies pom.xmls. Um and those dependencies pom.xmls. Um and those dependencies aren't actually used in the um aren't actually used in the um aren't actually used in the um production code. We're also seeing production code. We're also seeing production code. We're also seeing things coming from the um go do sum things coming from the um go do sum things coming from the um go do sum file. Um now a lot of people use go do file. Um now a lot of people use go do file. Um now a lot of people use go do sum for their um dev dependencies. Um sum for their um dev dependencies. Um sum for their um dev dependencies. Um unfortunately we can't make that blanket unfortunately we can't make that blanket unfortunately we can't make that blanket exclusion because actually we're seeing exclusion because actually we're seeing exclusion because actually we're seeing some development teams using that for some development teams using that for some development teams using that for their production dependencies. Um so a their production dependencies. Um so a their production dependencies. Um so a recent example of that we had a we were recent example of that we had a we were recent example of that we had a we were working with the mergers and working with the mergers and working with the mergers and acquisitions team um inbound acquisition acquisitions team um inbound acquisition acquisitions team um inbound acquisition and they had seven assets in their and they had seven assets in their and they had seven assets in their portfolio. We saw some from the ESBOM portfolio. We saw some from the ESBOM portfolio. We saw some from the ESBOM analysis, we saw some findings, some analysis, we saw some findings, some analysis, we saw some findings, some concerning findings coming from a go do concerning findings coming from a go do concerning findings coming from a go do sum. So we engaged in a Q&amp;A with the sum. So we engaged in a Q&amp;A with the sum. So we engaged in a Q&amp;A with the development team and they confirmed they development team and they confirmed they development team and they confirmed they were not using those um dependencies were not using those um dependencies were not using those um dependencies from the go do sum in the from the go do sum in the from the go do sum in the production. Same company, same production. Same company, same production. Same company, same development team, different asset. They development team, different asset. They development team, different asset. They were using the go do sum to manage their were using the go do sum to manage their were using the go do sum to manage their production dependencies. So again, we production dependencies. So again, we production dependencies. So again, we couldn't just do those exclusions. couldn't just do those exclusions. couldn't just do those exclusions. Some of the other findings that we're Some of the other findings that we're Some of the other findings that we're seeing um uh is scanning and config seeing um uh is scanning and config seeing um uh is scanning and config issues. So again, this has seen been issues. So again, this has seen been issues. So again, this has seen been seen in 27% of the sbombs that we've seen in 27% of the sbombs that we've seen in 27% of the sbombs that we've analyzed to analyzed to analyzed to date. So this is where we get an date. So this is where we get an date. So this is where we get an indication of the what the vendor has indication of the what the vendor has indication of the what the vendor has scanned. So we inadvertently find test scanned. So we inadvertently find test scanned. So we inadvertently find test and development code in the production and development code in the production and development code in the production sbomb. So they've in inadvertently sbomb. So they've in inadvertently sbomb. So they've in inadvertently pointed their scanning tool um at the pointed their scanning tool um at the pointed their scanning tool um at the incorrect code. We've also seen um incorrect code. We've also seen um incorrect code. We've also seen um configuration issues also um and again configuration issues also um and again configuration issues also um and again that makes its way into the sbomb and that makes its way into the sbomb and that makes its way into the sbomb and it's noise. I also want to talk about the noise. I also want to talk about the noise. I also want to talk about the scanning as well about different results scanning as well about different results scanning as well about different results from different scanners. So we all know from different scanners. So we all know from different scanners. So we all know no one scanner does a complete job. Um no one scanner does a complete job. Um no one scanner does a complete job. Um so through receiving an ESBO from our so through receiving an ESBO from our so through receiving an ESBO from our suppliers and then independently suppliers and then independently suppliers and then independently sometimes running a code scan ourselves sometimes running a code scan ourselves sometimes running a code scan ourselves we do see different results and that is we do see different results and that is we do see different results and that is a you know a blind spot awareness to a you know a blind spot awareness to a you know a blind spot awareness to some of the teams that we're working some of the teams that we're working some of the teams that we're working with. Um another example is we um we had with. Um another example is we um we had with. Um another example is we um we had the SBOM input from a vendor. We did a the SBOM input from a vendor. We did a the SBOM input from a vendor. We did a um independent code scan and we found a um independent code scan and we found a um independent code scan and we found a critical vulnerability coming from I critical vulnerability coming from I critical vulnerability coming from I think it was the cargo.lock file. And think it was the cargo.lock file. And think it was the cargo.lock file. And then when we had that conversation with then when we had that conversation with then when we had that conversation with the supplier, they didn't didn't know the supplier, they didn't didn't know the supplier, they didn't didn't know about that finding. It was a surprise to about that finding. It was a surprise to about that finding. It was a surprise to them and their tooling they were using them and their tooling they were using them and their tooling they were using only supported the um cargo.l file and only supported the um cargo.l file and only supported the um cargo.l file and that actually drive some enhancements that actually drive some enhancements that actually drive some enhancements with the scanning tool of their choice with the scanning tool of their choice with the scanning tool of their choice and and actually I think it was a couple and and actually I think it was a couple and and actually I think it was a couple months later the scanning tool they used months later the scanning tool they used months later the scanning tool they used indep um introduced the um support for indep um introduced the um support for indep um introduced the um support for that package that package that package manager. Okay. Poor housekeeping. Um so manager. Okay. Poor housekeeping. Um so manager. Okay. Poor housekeeping. Um so again it's always good to share an again it's always good to share an again it's always good to share an example. So we found um a a large number example. So we found um a a large number example. So we found um a a large number of findings coming from um a path in a of findings coming from um a path in a of findings coming from um a path in a code scan and actually it was an end of code scan and actually it was an end of code scan and actually it was an end of life product that was bundled um in the life product that was bundled um in the life product that was bundled um in the um offering and they just hadn't cleaned um offering and they just hadn't cleaned um offering and they just hadn't cleaned up the code. There were a lot of up the code. There were a lot of up the code. There were a lot of vulnerabilities um and so dev were aware vulnerabilities um and so dev were aware vulnerabilities um and so dev were aware that it was um end of life. They just that it was um end of life. They just that it was um end of life. They just hadn't taken it out of their codebase. hadn't taken it out of their codebase. hadn't taken it out of their codebase. So we see that a lot where there's So we see that a lot where there's So we see that a lot where there's dormant redundant code that just sits dormant redundant code that just sits dormant redundant code that just sits and lies in the production um code being and lies in the production um code being and lies in the production um code being scanned and it's just not not kept up scanned and it's just not not kept up scanned and it's just not not kept up and um poor and um poor and um poor housekeeping. Okay, vulnerability data. housekeeping. Okay, vulnerability data. housekeeping. Okay, vulnerability data. So this accounts and I'd say in probably So this accounts and I'd say in probably So this accounts and I'd say in probably the last six to n months we've seen a the last six to n months we've seen a the last six to n months we've seen a large increase in the number of um large increase in the number of um large increase in the number of um issues with the vulnerability data. So issues with the vulnerability data. So issues with the vulnerability data. So 40% um of the sbombs we've analyzed. So 40% um of the sbombs we've analyzed. So 40% um of the sbombs we've analyzed. So let me explain vulnerability data. John's made the text very big here for John's made the text very big here for John's made the text very big here for his eyesight, so I have to kind of his eyesight, so I have to kind of his eyesight, so I have to kind of scroll to keep up with the speaker scroll to keep up with the speaker scroll to keep up with the speaker notes. notes. notes. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. So, with the um ESBOM analysis Okay. So, with the um ESBOM analysis Okay. So, with the um ESBOM analysis platform that we're using, we are platform that we're using, we are platform that we're using, we are finding CVS reported and then when we go finding CVS reported and then when we go finding CVS reported and then when we go and dive a little bit deeper into the and dive a little bit deeper into the and dive a little bit deeper into the criticals and the highs, we're seeing criticals and the highs, we're seeing criticals and the highs, we're seeing actually some of the um analysis actually some of the um analysis actually some of the um analysis platforms we're using are reporting CVEs platforms we're using are reporting CVEs platforms we're using are reporting CVEs for unaffected versions. So the ESBO for unaffected versions. So the ESBO for unaffected versions. So the ESBO might call, you know, might list version might call, you know, might list version might call, you know, might list version 1.2, but when you dig down into the um 1.2, but when you dig down into the um 1.2, but when you dig down into the um the CVE, it's only, you know, affecting the CVE, it's only, you know, affecting the CVE, it's only, you know, affecting version 1.1 or less. Um and so we're version 1.1 or less. Um and so we're version 1.1 or less. Um and so we're seeing that kind of noise. We need to seeing that kind of noise. We need to seeing that kind of noise. We need to try and filter that try and filter that try and filter that out. Um we're also seeing um a lot of out. Um we're also seeing um a lot of out. Um we're also seeing um a lot of CVS reported from the ESBOM analysis CVS reported from the ESBOM analysis CVS reported from the ESBOM analysis platform and then when we have the platform and then when we have the platform and then when we have the engagement and the discussion with the engagement and the discussion with the engagement and the discussion with the um supplier or the vendor, they're um supplier or the vendor, they're um supplier or the vendor, they're unaware of those CVEs. And actually what unaware of those CVEs. And actually what unaware of those CVEs. And actually what we're seeing is the NVD is still in we're seeing is the NVD is still in we're seeing is the NVD is still in analysis or awaiting analysis or under analysis or awaiting analysis or under analysis or awaiting analysis or under reanalysis state. And so the scanning um reanalysis state. And so the scanning um reanalysis state. And so the scanning um tool that the vendor is using is tool that the vendor is using is tool that the vendor is using is behaving as correctly and isn't behaving as correctly and isn't behaving as correctly and isn't reporting yet on those CVEes, but we're reporting yet on those CVEes, but we're reporting yet on those CVEes, but we're using a a different data source for the using a a different data source for the using a a different data source for the CVE data. So we're seeing some CVE. So CVE data. So we're seeing some CVE. So CVE data. So we're seeing some CVE. So if you like, it's a little bit of a if you like, it's a little bit of a if you like, it's a little bit of a pre-alert to those development teams pre-alert to those development teams pre-alert to those development teams that that may may well land on their um that that may may well land on their um that that may may well land on their um on their dashboard. on their dashboard. on their dashboard. And then as John's talked about a lot of And then as John's talked about a lot of And then as John's talked about a lot of CVS we see are not affected and this is CVS we see are not affected and this is CVS we see are not affected and this is again having a discussion about them again having a discussion about them again having a discussion about them adopting VEX as to why they're not adopting VEX as to why they're not adopting VEX as to why they're not affected so that information is readily available. Okay. So given all those available. Okay. So given all those available. Okay. So given all those trends and the noise that we're seeing. trends and the noise that we're seeing. trends and the noise that we're seeing. So how can we improve um uh the the So how can we improve um uh the the So how can we improve um uh the the sbomb so it's a more complete accurate sbomb so it's a more complete accurate sbomb so it's a more complete accurate view of the production the production view of the production the production view of the production the production code. So again the themes we're seeing code. So again the themes we're seeing code. So again the themes we're seeing so package manager cleanup so so package manager cleanup so so package manager cleanup so encouraging teams to run the go tidy encouraging teams to run the go tidy encouraging teams to run the go tidy commands mpm proom so that actually what commands mpm proom so that actually what commands mpm proom so that actually what we see in their package manager files we see in their package manager files we see in their package manager files are actually the dependencies that are are actually the dependencies that are are actually the dependencies that are being used. being used. being used. um adoption of VEX. I know John's talked um adoption of VEX. I know John's talked um adoption of VEX. I know John's talked about that having the information um uh about that having the information um uh about that having the information um uh or asking for the supplier and the or asking for the supplier and the or asking for the supplier and the vendor to have that VEX um spreadsheet vendor to have that VEX um spreadsheet vendor to have that VEX um spreadsheet template completed so we understand why template completed so we understand why template completed so we understand why they're not affected and hopefully they're not affected and hopefully they're not affected and hopefully encouraging them to adopt that so when encouraging them to adopt that so when encouraging them to adopt that so when we ask the next time that information is we ask the next time that information is we ask the next time that information is readily readily readily available the um the NVD backlog issue available the um the NVD backlog issue available the um the NVD backlog issue and awaiting analysis reanalysis and awaiting analysis reanalysis and awaiting analysis reanalysis modified so where can we scrape through modified so where can we scrape through modified so where can we scrape through an automated way additional CVE data so an automated way additional CVE data so an automated way additional CVE data so we get additional context around the we get additional context around the we get additional context around the CVE. So if it's a version not affected CVE. So if it's a version not affected CVE. So if it's a version not affected um having that readily available through um having that readily available through um having that readily available through automation and for those um large number automation and for those um large number automation and for those um large number that we're seeing in reanalysis analysis that we're seeing in reanalysis analysis that we're seeing in reanalysis analysis state can we group those so at least state can we group those so at least state can we group those so at least when we have the conversation with the when we have the conversation with the when we have the conversation with the supplier we can say why they might may supplier we can say why they might may supplier we can say why they might may not yet be aware of those not yet be aware of those not yet be aware of those CVEs. So policy alerts and violations. CVEs. So policy alerts and violations. CVEs. So policy alerts and violations. So there's a lot of good tools out So there's a lot of good tools out So there's a lot of good tools out there. There's mend dependabot um cyber there. There's mend dependabot um cyber there. There's mend dependabot um cyber beats that John mentioned where you can beats that John mentioned where you can beats that John mentioned where you can um start getting these alerts at source. um start getting these alerts at source. um start getting these alerts at source. So if you're committing code into GitHub So if you're committing code into GitHub So if you're committing code into GitHub you get alerted if it's an aging library you get alerted if it's an aging library you get alerted if it's an aging library um countries of concern. So trying to um countries of concern. So trying to um countries of concern. So trying to get those at source. So we're not get those at source. So we're not get those at source. So we're not waiting until we see that content in the waiting until we see that content in the waiting until we see that content in the sbomb. And then continuous reviews. So sbomb. And then continuous reviews. So sbomb. And then continuous reviews. So development are continuously releasing. development are continuously releasing. development are continuously releasing. So we should be continuously reviewing So we should be continuously reviewing So we should be continuously reviewing what's in our sbombs. And also when we what's in our sbombs. And also when we what's in our sbombs. And also when we have a you know the the supplier vendor have a you know the the supplier vendor have a you know the the supplier vendor reviews um that's not a one-time we reviews um that's not a one-time we reviews um that's not a one-time we would expect them to come back with would expect them to come back with would expect them to come back with additional westbombs as we're consuming additional westbombs as we're consuming additional westbombs as we're consuming additional um software from them. Okay. So John stole my thunder on them. Okay. So John stole my thunder on them. Okay. So John stole my thunder on the 95% reduction. So um with the trend the 95% reduction. So um with the trend the 95% reduction. So um with the trend we've seen and the significant growth um we've seen and the significant growth um we've seen and the significant growth um there is we with the automation that there is we with the automation that there is we with the automation that we've um we've applied here we have seen we've um we've applied here we have seen we've um we've applied here we have seen a 95% reduction in the time it takes to a 95% reduction in the time it takes to a 95% reduction in the time it takes to assess the yes bombs which is much assess the yes bombs which is much assess the yes bombs which is much needed if that trend continues needed if that trend continues needed if that trend continues uh increas increasing our awareness and uh increas increasing our awareness and uh increas increasing our awareness and through our vendors on um cyber hygiene through our vendors on um cyber hygiene through our vendors on um cyber hygiene and as a net result that improves the and as a net result that improves the and as a net result that improves the product security posture and then John product security posture and then John product security posture and then John for the technical for the technical for the technical um so for the technical um so for the technical um so for the technical outcomes. I mean really the automation, outcomes. I mean really the automation, outcomes. I mean really the automation, the efforts, the efficiencies that we've the efforts, the efficiencies that we've the efforts, the efficiencies that we've been able to gain. Um again that 95% been able to gain. Um again that 95% been able to gain. Um again that 95% reduction um the standardization right reduction um the standardization right reduction um the standardization right so we we can crank through the analysis so we we can crank through the analysis so we we can crank through the analysis and we have a standard output that needs and we have a standard output that needs and we have a standard output that needs minimal customization for each minimal customization for each minimal customization for each particular vendor working with us. particular vendor working with us. particular vendor working with us. um they util you know this again it's um they util you know this again it's um they util you know this again it's all about VEX really right trying to get all about VEX really right trying to get all about VEX really right trying to get to VEX that's obviously a key piece of to VEX that's obviously a key piece of to VEX that's obviously a key piece of of what's making this all more efficient of what's making this all more efficient of what's making this all more efficient in terms of the information exchange in terms of the information exchange in terms of the information exchange um so you know continuing to work with um so you know continuing to work with um so you know continuing to work with that our our particular template a that our our particular template a that our our particular template a spreadsheet is certainly an initial step spreadsheet is certainly an initial step spreadsheet is certainly an initial step uh we've made significant improvements uh we've made significant improvements uh we've made significant improvements in getting that information to also go in getting that information to also go in getting that information to also go back per the vex standards into our own back per the vex standards into our own back per the vex standards into our own internal systems Um, internal systems Um, internal systems Um, finally really, you know, we do a lot I finally really, you know, we do a lot I finally really, you know, we do a lot I I've referenced a couple times I've referenced a couple times I've referenced a couple times dependency track. We think it's a dependency track. We think it's a dependency track. We think it's a fantastic tool. We've worked quite a bit fantastic tool. We've worked quite a bit fantastic tool. We've worked quite a bit with the OASP foundation and um we we with the OASP foundation and um we we with the OASP foundation and um we we are strong believers in the work that we are strong believers in the work that we are strong believers in the work that we do in open source and contributing this do in open source and contributing this do in open source and contributing this back. So I mean just one I think in in back. So I mean just one I think in in back. So I mean just one I think in in maybe the last you know 6 to 8 months to maybe the last you know 6 to 8 months to maybe the last you know 6 to 8 months to a year at least 15 plus contributions a year at least 15 plus contributions a year at least 15 plus contributions back to OAS dependency track. Um I know back to OAS dependency track. Um I know back to OAS dependency track. Um I know we have several members uh Melba Lopez we have several members uh Melba Lopez we have several members uh Melba Lopez um and Caroline Lee are very involved um and Caroline Lee are very involved um and Caroline Lee are very involved with hosting the monthly meetings um with hosting the monthly meetings um with hosting the monthly meetings um also for dependency track and OASP. So also for dependency track and OASP. So also for dependency track and OASP. So that constant thinking about how can we that constant thinking about how can we that constant thinking about how can we give back to the open source community. give back to the open source community. give back to the open source community. Um so with that I think we will now open Um so with that I think we will now open Um so with that I think we will now open this up to some discussion and to some this up to some discussion and to some this up to some discussion and to some questions. Thank you very much for for questions. Thank you very much for for questions. Thank you very much for for being here. We have a solid one minute for We have a solid one minute for We have a solid one minute for questions. Sorry. So is there any questions. Sorry. So is there any questions. Sorry. So is there any burning questions? There's one right burning questions? There's one right burning questions? There's one right here. Sorry. Yes. Uh Cisco Corona team, thank you for Yes. Uh Cisco Corona team, thank you for Yes. Uh Cisco Corona team, thank you for presentation. It's really like ringing presentation. It's really like ringing presentation. It's really like ringing the bell about everything that you talk the bell about everything that you talk the bell about everything that you talk about like sbomb antipatterns and I about like sbomb antipatterns and I about like sbomb antipatterns and I would like to talk about another would like to talk about another would like to talk about another antipattern. uh in ESBOM it's antipattern. uh in ESBOM it's antipattern. uh in ESBOM it's versionless components right so maybe versionless components right so maybe versionless components right so maybe for some for some reason um the for some for some reason um the for some for some reason um the discovery mechanism can be like not discovery mechanism can be like not discovery mechanism can be like not ideal right and uh some discovery ideal right and uh some discovery ideal right and uh some discovery mechanism matching was able to find mechanism matching was able to find mechanism matching was able to find component uh to the sbomb but was not component uh to the sbomb but was not component uh to the sbomb but was not able to match the version so the able to match the version so the able to match the version so the question is uh what is your strategy question is uh what is your strategy question is uh what is your strategy dealing with the versionless components dealing with the versionless components dealing with the versionless components and maybe you have some um like good and maybe you have some um like good and maybe you have some um like good practices how to deal with versionless practices how to deal with versionless practices how to deal with versionless compon compon compon Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. You go. Yeah, go ahead. I can take a You go. Yeah, go ahead. I can take a You go. Yeah, go ahead. I can take a stab at that and it's quite an easy stab at that and it's quite an easy stab at that and it's quite an easy answer actually for us. So actually it's answer actually for us. So actually it's answer actually for us. So actually it's just engaging with the development team just engaging with the development team just engaging with the development team or the supplier or the vendor. If if or the supplier or the vendor. If if or the supplier or the vendor. If if we're unable to automate the we're unable to automate the we're unable to automate the determination of the version that's determination of the version that's determination of the version that's actually in use, then yeah, it has to be actually in use, then yeah, it has to be actually in use, then yeah, it has to be um a conversation with the development um a conversation with the development um a conversation with the development to understand that. Um I don't know if to understand that. Um I don't know if to understand that. Um I don't know if you've got anything to add. Is it like you've got anything to add. Is it like you've got anything to add. Is it like you consider a show? you consider a show? you consider a show? No, sometimes you can't uh we see it a No, sometimes you can't uh we see it a No, sometimes you can't uh we see it a lot with the Golang. You can't always lot with the Golang. You can't always lot with the Golang. You can't always determine the version. determine the version. determine the version. Um and it's engaging with the dev teams Um and it's engaging with the dev teams Um and it's engaging with the dev teams or where package manager is calling for or where package manager is calling for or where package manager is calling for equal or greater than and you you know equal or greater than and you you know equal or greater than and you you know and then sometimes you have to rely on and then sometimes you have to rely on and then sometimes you have to rely on analyzing the latest version that's analyzing the latest version that's analyzing the latest version that's available. available. available. Actually, I'm going to cut it off. I Actually, I'm going to cut it off. I Actually, I'm going to cut it off. I want to give everybody that opportunity. want to give everybody that opportunity. want to give everybody that opportunity.
