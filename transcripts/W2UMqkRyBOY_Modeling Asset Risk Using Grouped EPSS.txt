Kind: captions Language: en Hey everyone, uh thanks for coming. Uh Hey everyone, uh thanks for coming. Uh Hey everyone, uh thanks for coming. Uh this talk is modeling asset risk uh this talk is modeling asset risk uh this talk is modeling asset risk uh using grouped EPSS. Um it's a topic that using grouped EPSS. Um it's a topic that using grouped EPSS. Um it's a topic that I've been sort of semi researching how I've been sort of semi researching how I've been sort of semi researching how to operationalize over the past year or to operationalize over the past year or to operationalize over the past year or so. Um I wrote a blog on it uh last so. Um I wrote a blog on it uh last so. Um I wrote a blog on it uh last year. Uh if you caught that, great. Um, year. Uh if you caught that, great. Um, year. Uh if you caught that, great. Um, it's more so going to be summarizing it's more so going to be summarizing it's more so going to be summarizing what that was and sort of some insights what that was and sort of some insights what that was and sort of some insights into uh what I've been doing with it into uh what I've been doing with it into uh what I've been doing with it recently. Um, so without further ado, recently. Um, so without further ado, recently. Um, so without further ado, uh, who am uh, who am uh, who am I? Uh, I am a principal security I? Uh, I am a principal security I? Uh, I am a principal security engineer at Madna Therapeutics. Um, if engineer at Madna Therapeutics. Um, if engineer at Madna Therapeutics. Um, if you don't know what MADNA is, uh, you don't know what MADNA is, uh, you don't know what MADNA is, uh, they're the people who developed the they're the people who developed the they're the people who developed the mRNA COVID 19 vaccine. Um, so pretty mRNA COVID 19 vaccine. Um, so pretty mRNA COVID 19 vaccine. Um, so pretty important stuff. Uh, we have a a pretty important stuff. Uh, we have a a pretty important stuff. Uh, we have a a pretty large manufacturing uh, operation there. large manufacturing uh, operation there. large manufacturing uh, operation there. Um, so lots of fun problems to solve. Um, so lots of fun problems to solve. Um, so lots of fun problems to solve. Um, I'm also the EPSS special interest Um, I'm also the EPSS special interest Um, I'm also the EPSS special interest group co-chair along with Jacobs. group co-chair along with Jacobs. group co-chair along with Jacobs. Essentially, uh, what I do there is Essentially, uh, what I do there is Essentially, uh, what I do there is just, uh, run part of the community, uh, just, uh, run part of the community, uh, just, uh, run part of the community, uh, making sure that making sure that making sure that our speaker All right, one sec. Yeah, that's fine. Cool. sec. Yeah, that's fine. Cool. sec. Yeah, that's fine. Cool. Um, sorry about that. Uh, I previously Um, sorry about that. Uh, I previously Um, sorry about that. Uh, I previously worked at Pelaton. Um, and prior to that worked at Pelaton. Um, and prior to that worked at Pelaton. Um, and prior to that I was a contractor for the Centers for I was a contractor for the Centers for I was a contractor for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services or CMS. Medicare and Medicaid Services or CMS. Medicare and Medicaid Services or CMS. um did a lot of interesting work there um did a lot of interesting work there um did a lot of interesting work there obviously with disperate uh uh uh obviously with disperate uh uh uh obviously with disperate uh uh uh infrastructure. Um but uh I believe I infrastructure. Um but uh I believe I infrastructure. Um but uh I believe I did something that mattered uh at both did something that mattered uh at both did something that mattered uh at both of those places. Um and my life is of those places. Um and my life is of those places. Um and my life is absolutely bonkers crazy. Um I'm a dad absolutely bonkers crazy. Um I'm a dad absolutely bonkers crazy. Um I'm a dad of three kids, 64 and two. I do not of three kids, 64 and two. I do not of three kids, 64 and two. I do not recommend this. Um so if if if you're recommend this. Um so if if if you're recommend this. Um so if if if you're thinking about having kids, please stop thinking about having kids, please stop thinking about having kids, please stop it, too. Um it's it's a fun fun time. Um it, too. Um it's it's a fun fun time. Um it, too. Um it's it's a fun fun time. Um so a lot of this week for me is like I so a lot of this week for me is like I so a lot of this week for me is like I get some clarity uh and some some peace get some clarity uh and some some peace get some clarity uh and some some peace a little bit. So uh if a little bit. So uh if a little bit. So uh if I'm I'm I'm just not making sense now you know just not making sense now you know just not making sense now you know why. Um so we have a problem uh in in why. Um so we have a problem uh in in why. Um so we have a problem uh in in vulnerability management. vulnerability management. vulnerability management. Um we're uh we have an increasing number Um we're uh we have an increasing number Um we're uh we have an increasing number of this is just the CVE numbers over the of this is just the CVE numbers over the of this is just the CVE numbers over the past 25 years now. Um and they're going past 25 years now. Um and they're going past 25 years now. Um and they're going up, right? They're going up over time. up, right? They're going up over time. up, right? They're going up over time. Um they're increasingly going up. Um, so Um they're increasingly going up. Um, so Um they're increasingly going up. Um, so essentially what we're doing is we're we essentially what we're doing is we're we essentially what we're doing is we're we have a a pipeline of vulnerability data have a a pipeline of vulnerability data have a a pipeline of vulnerability data coming into our organization and it is coming into our organization and it is coming into our organization and it is not slowing down and our capacity not slowing down and our capacity not slowing down and our capacity probably does not change over time. It's probably does not change over time. It's probably does not change over time. It's probably going to stay the same. Um, I probably going to stay the same. Um, I probably going to stay the same. Um, I mean there might be obviously some mean there might be obviously some mean there might be obviously some investments that we make in tools or investments that we make in tools or investments that we make in tools or people or processes to make that better. people or processes to make that better. people or processes to make that better. Um but in general I don't think that our Um but in general I don't think that our Um but in general I don't think that our capabilities for uh you know patching capabilities for uh you know patching capabilities for uh you know patching all the things is keeping up with the all the things is keeping up with the all the things is keeping up with the rate of of things coming in. Um here's a rate of of things coming in. Um here's a rate of of things coming in. Um here's a similar uh graph from the EPSS uh uh similar uh graph from the EPSS uh uh similar uh graph from the EPSS uh uh stats page. Um just a different view. stats page. Um just a different view. stats page. Um just a different view. You can clearly see 2025 is is uh You can clearly see 2025 is is uh You can clearly see 2025 is is uh outperforming all of the other years outperforming all of the other years outperforming all of the other years since 2017 which is I believe when the since 2017 which is I believe when the since 2017 which is I believe when the CNA program expanded. Um so again CNA program expanded. Um so again CNA program expanded. Um so again increasing rates of vulnerabilities. Um increasing rates of vulnerabilities. Um increasing rates of vulnerabilities. Um I it begs the question uh for me like I it begs the question uh for me like I it begs the question uh for me like what do I do about that right? what do I do about that right? what do I do about that right? Um this is another uh uh slide from um Um this is another uh uh slide from um Um this is another uh uh slide from um the Scientia and Kenna prioritization of the Scientia and Kenna prioritization of the Scientia and Kenna prioritization of prediction volume 3 uh which basically prediction volume 3 uh which basically prediction volume 3 uh which basically tells us we're averaging about 10% or tells us we're averaging about 10% or tells us we're averaging about 10% or the industry is averaging about 10% of the industry is averaging about 10% of the industry is averaging about 10% of their backlog uh closing month over their backlog uh closing month over their backlog uh closing month over month. Um and so if you couple that with month. Um and so if you couple that with month. Um and so if you couple that with the increasing rate of vulnerabilities the increasing rate of vulnerabilities the increasing rate of vulnerabilities coming in coming in coming in um there's just there's a lot of um there's just there's a lot of um there's just there's a lot of vulnerabilities and data that we sort of vulnerabilities and data that we sort of vulnerabilities and data that we sort of have to account for in our environment have to account for in our environment have to account for in our environment and organization. Um so just to and organization. Um so just to and organization. Um so just to summarize uh what how I see the problem summarize uh what how I see the problem summarize uh what how I see the problem right we have an increasing arrival rate right we have an increasing arrival rate right we have an increasing arrival rate of CVES of CVES of CVES year-over-year. Um, on average, the year-over-year. Um, on average, the year-over-year. Um, on average, the industry is addressing approximately 10% industry is addressing approximately 10% industry is addressing approximately 10% of their vulnerability backlog month of their vulnerability backlog month of their vulnerability backlog month over month. Um, and so as a over month. Um, and so as a over month. Um, and so as a vulnerability management program, how do vulnerability management program, how do vulnerability management program, how do we effectively measure and communicate we effectively measure and communicate we effectively measure and communicate risk and risk reduction if we aren't risk and risk reduction if we aren't risk and risk reduction if we aren't fixing everything? Um, and I've been fixing everything? Um, and I've been fixing everything? Um, and I've been sort of grappling with this sort of grappling with this sort of grappling with this problem. I don't know s you know since problem. I don't know s you know since problem. I don't know s you know since my days at CMS where a lot of the the my days at CMS where a lot of the the my days at CMS where a lot of the the stuff at CMS was uh based off of um you stuff at CMS was uh based off of um you stuff at CMS was uh based off of um you know Fed ramp and and and vulnerability know Fed ramp and and and vulnerability know Fed ramp and and and vulnerability scoring and and the severity of scoring and and the severity of scoring and and the severity of vulnerabilities and which things or you vulnerabilities and which things or you vulnerabilities and which things or you know we have audits that happen and we know we have audits that happen and we know we have audits that happen and we have findings and we have to fix have findings and we have to fix have findings and we have to fix everything in this tiny window to to everything in this tiny window to to everything in this tiny window to to make sure we pass this audit or uh just make sure we pass this audit or uh just make sure we pass this audit or uh just you know month over month. uh we have you know month over month. uh we have you know month over month. uh we have you know over 50% of our vulnerabilities you know over 50% of our vulnerabilities you know over 50% of our vulnerabilities have to get fixed in that month or have to get fixed in that month or have to get fixed in that month or within that month or something like that within that month or something like that within that month or something like that which is just it frankly it's untenable which is just it frankly it's untenable which is just it frankly it's untenable right and it and it requires us to right and it and it requires us to right and it and it requires us to creatively get around that in some creatively get around that in some creatively get around that in some instances especially in the government instances especially in the government instances especially in the government where it's just by law required to where it's just by law required to where it's just by law required to do certain things right um so I came up do certain things right um so I came up do certain things right um so I came up I didn't come up with this but I I read I didn't come up with this but I I read I didn't come up with this but I I read something on the uh EPSS uh original something on the uh EPSS uh original something on the uh EPSS uh original user guide on the first.org uh talking user guide on the first.org uh talking user guide on the first.org uh talking about um this concept about um this concept about um this concept of scaling EPSS of scaling EPSS of scaling EPSS um um um to not just vulnerabilities but to like to not just vulnerabilities but to like to not just vulnerabilities but to like assets, network segments, entire assets, network segments, entire assets, network segments, entire departments, entire organizations to departments, entire organizations to departments, entire organizations to understand what is the probability that understand what is the probability that understand what is the probability that at least one of these um vulnerabilities at least one of these um vulnerabilities at least one of these um vulnerabilities will be exploited in the wild. Right? So will be exploited in the wild. Right? So will be exploited in the wild. Right? So that's what this is. It's the that's what this is. It's the that's what this is. It's the probability that at least one CVE in a probability that at least one CVE in a probability that at least one CVE in a group will be exploited. Um if we hold group will be exploited. Um if we hold group will be exploited. Um if we hold true that the the axiom around EPSS true that the the axiom around EPSS true that the the axiom around EPSS is this is the measure of probability of is this is the measure of probability of is this is the measure of probability of exploitation in the wild. Um so that's exploitation in the wild. Um so that's exploitation in the wild. Um so that's that's where we're starting from. Um and that's where we're starting from. Um and that's where we're starting from. Um and we're grouping our our CVEes together we're grouping our our CVEes together we're grouping our our CVEes together based off of either assets or network based off of either assets or network based off of either assets or network segments or or what have you. Um, here's segments or or what have you. Um, here's segments or or what have you. Um, here's a pretty formula that I just threw up a pretty formula that I just threw up a pretty formula that I just threw up here. Um, it's kind of scary. It's got a here. Um, it's kind of scary. It's got a here. Um, it's kind of scary. It's got a big pi symbol in it. big pi symbol in it. big pi symbol in it. Um, so if we start in those parentheses Um, so if we start in those parentheses Um, so if we start in those parentheses right on the very right, um, and we have right on the very right, um, and we have right on the very right, um, and we have EPSS subi, that's just the instance of EPSS subi, that's just the instance of EPSS subi, that's just the instance of an EPSS score. And when we do, um, the an EPSS score. And when we do, um, the an EPSS score. And when we do, um, the inverse of that, we get the probability inverse of that, we get the probability inverse of that, we get the probability that it won't be exploited in the next that it won't be exploited in the next that it won't be exploited in the next 30 days. And then if we take the um 30 days. And then if we take the um 30 days. And then if we take the um product of all of those scores for a product of all of those scores for a product of all of those scores for a specific segment. So let's just take specific segment. So let's just take specific segment. So let's just take assets for an example. assets for an example. assets for an example. Um we get the cumulative probability Um we get the cumulative probability Um we get the cumulative probability that no CVE on this asset will be that no CVE on this asset will be that no CVE on this asset will be exploited. Right? So that's that covers exploited. Right? So that's that covers exploited. Right? So that's that covers the everything from the product symbol the everything from the product symbol the everything from the product symbol to the right. And then if you take the to the right. And then if you take the to the right. And then if you take the inverse of that uh it is the probability inverse of that uh it is the probability inverse of that uh it is the probability that at least one of those CVEes will be that at least one of those CVEes will be that at least one of those CVEes will be exploited. So it sort of gives you this exploited. So it sort of gives you this exploited. So it sort of gives you this cumulative score at the asset level or cumulative score at the asset level or cumulative score at the asset level or at the grouping like what whatever at the grouping like what whatever at the grouping like what whatever you're grouping but for purposes of this you're grouping but for purposes of this you're grouping but for purposes of this talk let's just talk about assets right talk let's just talk about assets right talk let's just talk about assets right or or VMs or instances whatever or or VMs or instances whatever or or VMs or instances whatever um so yeah uh this is the the snippet um so yeah uh this is the the snippet um so yeah uh this is the the snippet from the user guide on on first.org from the user guide on on first.org from the user guide on on first.org work. work. work. Um, it's and I'm not a data scientist, Um, it's and I'm not a data scientist, Um, it's and I'm not a data scientist, nor am I a stats person. Uh, nor am I a stats person. Uh, nor am I a stats person. Uh, unfortunately, my stats ended in trying unfortunately, my stats ended in trying unfortunately, my stats ended in trying to pass a course uh in college uh to get to pass a course uh in college uh to get to pass a course uh in college uh to get a degree. Um, but now I'm revisiting all a degree. Um, but now I'm revisiting all a degree. Um, but now I'm revisiting all of that. So, it's fun. Um, but of that. So, it's fun. Um, but of that. So, it's fun. Um, but essentially there's this statistical essentially there's this statistical essentially there's this statistical property about the independence of property about the independence of property about the independence of events. Um events. Um events. Um and if we assume that um you know and if we assume that um you know and if we assume that um you know vulnerabilities being exploited are vulnerabilities being exploited are vulnerabilities being exploited are independent of each other then this is independent of each other then this is independent of each other then this is sort of valid right um and uh I sort of valid right um and uh I sort of valid right um and uh I apologize again there is code in this apologize again there is code in this apologize again there is code in this slide so I've just hit you with a double slide so I've just hit you with a double slide so I've just hit you with a double whammy of uh a formula and code but I I whammy of uh a formula and code but I I whammy of uh a formula and code but I I put this up here just to sort of show put this up here just to sort of show put this up here just to sort of show you it's actually really easy to you it's actually really easy to you it's actually really easy to calculate uh and this is Python calculate uh and this is Python calculate uh and this is Python Um, and I'll explain this, but Um, and I'll explain this, but Um, and I'll explain this, but essentially it's three lines of code. essentially it's three lines of code. essentially it's three lines of code. Um, and the first one is just importing Um, and the first one is just importing Um, and the first one is just importing the pandas library, right? Um, and let's the pandas library, right? Um, and let's the pandas library, right? Um, and let's assume that we have a CSV that is assume that we have a CSV that is assume that we have a CSV that is flattened that has our mapping of assets flattened that has our mapping of assets flattened that has our mapping of assets to CVEes. And if we import that uh into to CVEes. And if we import that uh into to CVEes. And if we import that uh into uh a data frame and then we join that uh a data frame and then we join that uh a data frame and then we join that with or left join that with um the with or left join that with um the with or left join that with um the current EPSS scores or whatever you if current EPSS scores or whatever you if current EPSS scores or whatever you if you want to look at it in the past you you want to look at it in the past you you want to look at it in the past you can obviously replace that uh URL can obviously replace that uh URL can obviously replace that uh URL um and just join those two things um and just join those two things um and just join those two things together. Um and then at the very bottom together. Um and then at the very bottom together. Um and then at the very bottom that's the the third third line there um that's the the third third line there um that's the the third third line there um we can just group on asset uh ID uh and we can just group on asset uh ID uh and we can just group on asset uh ID uh and then for each EPSS score we apply that then for each EPSS score we apply that then for each EPSS score we apply that formula which is in this lambda formula which is in this lambda formula which is in this lambda function. Um so it's slides will be function. Um so it's slides will be function. Um so it's slides will be available. You can look at this later. I available. You can look at this later. I available. You can look at this later. I have it on my blog. Please feel free to have it on my blog. Please feel free to have it on my blog. Please feel free to copy and use this in your environments copy and use this in your environments copy and use this in your environments if you're very curious. Um yeah that's if you're very curious. Um yeah that's if you're very curious. Um yeah that's it. the result is a uh you know a nice it. the result is a uh you know a nice it. the result is a uh you know a nice mapping of mapping of mapping of uh the score per asset, right? And you uh the score per asset, right? And you uh the score per asset, right? And you can just then use that for for anything can just then use that for for anything can just then use that for for anything that you want. Um so I hit you with a that you want. Um so I hit you with a that you want. Um so I hit you with a double whammy. Uh and I'd like to just double whammy. Uh and I'd like to just double whammy. Uh and I'd like to just cleanse uh that the the slides for a cleanse uh that the the slides for a cleanse uh that the the slides for a second. Um this is my dog as a puppy. I second. Um this is my dog as a puppy. I second. Um this is my dog as a puppy. I just, you know, it's a cute picture. just, you know, it's a cute picture. just, you know, it's a cute picture. Sir, microphone. This is a good slide to stop microphone. This is a good slide to stop microphone. This is a good slide to stop on. Excuse. on. Excuse. on. Excuse. Dog's name is Finn. Uh, if you take a Dog's name is Finn. Uh, if you take a Dog's name is Finn. Uh, if you take a bunch of assets uh with those DPSS bunch of assets uh with those DPSS bunch of assets uh with those DPSS scores, isn't the EPSS score like the scores, isn't the EPSS score like the scores, isn't the EPSS score like the probability of any CV being exploited probability of any CV being exploited probability of any CV being exploited just like the maximum one? Why? Why do just like the maximum one? Why? Why do just like the maximum one? Why? Why do you need this more complicated formula? you need this more complicated formula? you need this more complicated formula? That's what I'm understanding. Why is That's what I'm understanding. Why is That's what I'm understanding. Why is Can you repeat the question? Sorry. Why Can you repeat the question? Sorry. Why Can you repeat the question? Sorry. Why why the function isn't just max just why the function isn't just max just why the function isn't just max just taking a max CPC score. So like taking a max CPC score. So like taking a max CPC score. So like why because we're so I'm I'm talking why because we're so I'm I'm talking why because we're so I'm I'm talking about about about the probability of at least one of these the probability of at least one of these the probability of at least one of these things that means there could be more of things that means there could be more of things that means there could be more of them or there you know it's at least one them or there you know it's at least one them or there you know it's at least one sure there's a max and it's so the score sure there's a max and it's so the score sure there's a max and it's so the score is likely going to be higher than that is likely going to be higher than that is likely going to be higher than that max is what I'm what we're saying. Um, max is what I'm what we're saying. Um, max is what I'm what we're saying. Um, and yeah, like good point about wouldn't and yeah, like good point about wouldn't and yeah, like good point about wouldn't like what do I do with this information? like what do I do with this information? like what do I do with this information? Like do I just prioritize the CVE that Like do I just prioritize the CVE that Like do I just prioritize the CVE that has the highest score? Yeah, I'll get to has the highest score? Yeah, I'll get to has the highest score? Yeah, I'll get to that. Um, but essentially yes, like that that. Um, but essentially yes, like that that. Um, but essentially yes, like that is a it's a good start, but in the is a it's a good start, but in the is a it's a good start, but in the context of everything, we want to look context of everything, we want to look context of everything, we want to look at at at we're sort of framing this we're sort of framing this we're sort of framing this in asset land rather than vulnerability in asset land rather than vulnerability in asset land rather than vulnerability land, right? like I don't I want to know land, right? like I don't I want to know land, right? like I don't I want to know which assets are the most vulnerable or which assets are the most vulnerable or which assets are the most vulnerable or the which ones are the most likely to be the which ones are the most likely to be the which ones are the most likely to be to have exploitation activity associated to have exploitation activity associated to have exploitation activity associated with them, right? Um so good question. with them, right? Um so good question. with them, right? Um so good question. Um again, I'm going to stop here. Um again, I'm going to stop here. Um again, I'm going to stop here. Um anyway, uh yeah, so um here's a Um anyway, uh yeah, so um here's a Um anyway, uh yeah, so um here's a visual of like some sample data, right? visual of like some sample data, right? visual of like some sample data, right? Um and it's a distribution from 0 to Um and it's a distribution from 0 to Um and it's a distribution from 0 to one. Let's just say like so on the uh uh one. Let's just say like so on the uh uh one. Let's just say like so on the uh uh x-axis there is our our grouped eps x-axis there is our our grouped eps x-axis there is our our grouped eps score um at the asset level uh and then score um at the asset level uh and then score um at the asset level uh and then just on the y-axis there the number of just on the y-axis there the number of just on the y-axis there the number of assets uh per but bin of like 5% between assets uh per but bin of like 5% between assets uh per but bin of like 5% between zero and one right um and so okay great zero and one right um and so okay great zero and one right um and so okay great what does this tell us like I have some what does this tell us like I have some what does this tell us like I have some peaks and valleys um between 0 and one uh most um between 0 and one uh most um between 0 and one uh most notably uh these higher ones uh around notably uh these higher ones uh around notably uh these higher ones uh around 65% and 95 90% uh of my assets. Your 65% and 95 90% uh of my assets. Your 65% and 95 90% uh of my assets. Your mileage may vary here. Obviously, this mileage may vary here. Obviously, this mileage may vary here. Obviously, this is just completely sample data. Please is just completely sample data. Please is just completely sample data. Please do not um use this as an indication of do not um use this as an indication of do not um use this as an indication of data um that's typical. Um I don't know data um that's typical. Um I don't know data um that's typical. Um I don't know what data is typical because I am one what data is typical because I am one what data is typical because I am one person. Um so I encourage you to look at person. Um so I encourage you to look at person. Um so I encourage you to look at this internally uh and try and make this internally uh and try and make this internally uh and try and make sense of it. Um so like again uh what sense of it. Um so like again uh what sense of it. Um so like again uh what does this tell me right? Um so does this tell me right? Um so does this tell me right? Um so regardless uh regardless uh regardless uh of the reason for peaks and valleys, it of the reason for peaks and valleys, it of the reason for peaks and valleys, it actually gives us a good indicator that actually gives us a good indicator that actually gives us a good indicator that hm we should investigate this like why hm we should investigate this like why hm we should investigate this like why are these things hovering around close are these things hovering around close are these things hovering around close to one or or in the middle here or um to one or or in the middle here or um to one or or in the middle here or um you know what's going on you know at you know what's going on you know at you know what's going on you know at that spike at the very end. Is it that spike at the very end. Is it that spike at the very end. Is it because we don't have vulnerability data because we don't have vulnerability data because we don't have vulnerability data for these for these assets? Right. for these for these assets? Right. for these for these assets? Right. Um, but my first indication would be or Um, but my first indication would be or Um, but my first indication would be or my first thought would be let's look at my first thought would be let's look at my first thought would be let's look at this one right here. Why why are things this one right here. Why why are things this one right here. Why why are things so high? Is it because there's a lot of so high? Is it because there's a lot of so high? Is it because there's a lot of CVEEs on there with small scores or is CVEEs on there with small scores or is CVEEs on there with small scores or is it just one CVE with something that's, it just one CVE with something that's, it just one CVE with something that's, you know, 0.95 or something like that? you know, 0.95 or something like that? you know, 0.95 or something like that? Um, but it does so it gives us a a good Um, but it does so it gives us a a good Um, but it does so it gives us a a good avenue of like determining avenue of like determining avenue of like determining um what to look at. Uh and we can also um what to look at. Uh and we can also um what to look at. Uh and we can also enrich this further. Um and so enrich this further. Um and so enrich this further. Um and so uh this is a a sample overlay of like a uh this is a a sample overlay of like a uh this is a a sample overlay of like a sample data classification standard that sample data classification standard that sample data classification standard that you might have internally. Um and let's you might have internally. Um and let's you might have internally. Um and let's you know for purposes of this talk let's you know for purposes of this talk let's you know for purposes of this talk let's say that you were successfully able to say that you were successfully able to say that you were successfully able to assign what data classification your assign what data classification your assign what data classification your assets are actually processing. Right? assets are actually processing. Right? assets are actually processing. Right? So we can say this this data classific So we can say this this data classific So we can say this this data classific or this asset is processing this type of or this asset is processing this type of or this asset is processing this type of sensitive data um regardless of how many sensitive data um regardless of how many sensitive data um regardless of how many records right let's just keep it at as records right let's just keep it at as records right let's just keep it at as qualitative as possible um again it qualitative as possible um again it qualitative as possible um again it gives me a really good marriage between gives me a really good marriage between gives me a really good marriage between something that I know is um the something that I know is um the something that I know is um the likelihood of an an event happening on likelihood of an an event happening on likelihood of an an event happening on this asset and the potential impact of this asset and the potential impact of this asset and the potential impact of it. And to me, that's risk, right? It's it. And to me, that's risk, right? It's it. And to me, that's risk, right? It's we we're able to quantify um likelihood we we're able to quantify um likelihood we we're able to quantify um likelihood at the asset level and we're able to at the asset level and we're able to at the asset level and we're able to qualitatively assign qualitatively assign qualitatively assign um attributes to those assets that could um attributes to those assets that could um attributes to those assets that could indicate impact. Now, could you take indicate impact. Now, could you take indicate impact. Now, could you take this further and go into quantification this further and go into quantification this further and go into quantification of impact? Absolutely. I do not know how of impact? Absolutely. I do not know how of impact? Absolutely. I do not know how to do that. to do that. to do that. So, so what actions can I take with this So, so what actions can I take with this So, so what actions can I take with this information? information? information? Um, obviously we can just grab th that Um, obviously we can just grab th that Um, obviously we can just grab th that bin uh near the top near one um rank bin uh near the top near one um rank bin uh near the top near one um rank order them by uh that the grouped EPSS order them by uh that the grouped EPSS order them by uh that the grouped EPSS score um and grab a meeting with those score um and grab a meeting with those score um and grab a meeting with those owners when you find them. Um because I owners when you find them. Um because I owners when you find them. Um because I know that's a difficult problem for know that's a difficult problem for know that's a difficult problem for everybody. everybody. everybody. Um, and then again just like have a like Um, and then again just like have a like Um, and then again just like have a like what I've been doing um over my over the what I've been doing um over my over the what I've been doing um over my over the past year or something is just taking a past year or something is just taking a past year or something is just taking a very small subset of the very highest very small subset of the very highest very small subset of the very highest thing that I care about and just having thing that I care about and just having thing that I care about and just having a discussion about why is this a discussion about why is this a discussion about why is this happening? Why are we are is it the happening? Why are we are is it the happening? Why are we are is it the technology stack that we're using on technology stack that we're using on technology stack that we're using on these things? um you know is these things? um you know is these things? um you know is it it could be a a many number of things it it could be a a many number of things it it could be a a many number of things like why aren't these things getting like why aren't these things getting like why aren't these things getting patches right it gives us information patches right it gives us information patches right it gives us information to further our decision-m process to to further our decision-m process to to further our decision-m process to understand what is going on in our understand what is going on in our understand what is going on in our environment um versus just relying on environment um versus just relying on environment um versus just relying on there's you know 10 CVES with a high there's you know 10 CVES with a high there's you know 10 CVES with a high EPSS score let's go fix them across um EPSS score let's go fix them across um EPSS score let's go fix them across um all of these assets which is a very all of these assets which is a very all of these assets which is a very valid response it's more of a Let's in valid response it's more of a Let's in valid response it's more of a Let's in let's let's go a step further and let's let's go a step further and let's let's go a step further and understand why these assets are understand why these assets are understand why these assets are emanating such high likelihood of emanating such high likelihood of emanating such high likelihood of exploitation. Um so in that meeting exploitation. Um so in that meeting exploitation. Um so in that meeting obviously you can investigate the obviously you can investigate the obviously you can investigate the business purposes and potential impact business purposes and potential impact business purposes and potential impact of compromise of these things. Um again of compromise of these things. Um again of compromise of these things. Um again why are these assets not getting why are these assets not getting why are these assets not getting patches? Um how we can uh overall patches? Um how we can uh overall patches? Um how we can uh overall improve our security posture based off improve our security posture based off improve our security posture based off of this information. Um, and then the of this information. Um, and then the of this information. Um, and then the last one here to your point uh back last one here to your point uh back last one here to your point uh back there, which CVEes will move the grouped there, which CVEes will move the grouped there, which CVEes will move the grouped EPSS score needle the most across EPSS score needle the most across EPSS score needle the most across assets? Um, which brings me to this. Uh, assets? Um, which brings me to this. Uh, assets? Um, which brings me to this. Uh, this is another little formula. I this is another little formula. I this is another little formula. I apologize again. I do not have another apologize again. I do not have another apologize again. I do not have another picture of my dog for this one. Um but picture of my dog for this one. Um but picture of my dog for this one. Um but uh it's a it's essentially just the uh it's a it's essentially just the uh it's a it's essentially just the difference between the the the asset uh difference between the the the asset uh difference between the the the asset uh score when you after you've remove said score when you after you've remove said score when you after you've remove said vulnerability from that and essentially vulnerability from that and essentially vulnerability from that and essentially it is rankordered by the the um CVE with it is rankordered by the the um CVE with it is rankordered by the the um CVE with the highest EPSS score, right? But uh it the highest EPSS score, right? But uh it the highest EPSS score, right? But uh it it also tells us which like how much it also tells us which like how much it also tells us which like how much this fixing this CVE or addressing this this fixing this CVE or addressing this this fixing this CVE or addressing this CVE will actually improve our posture, CVE will actually improve our posture, CVE will actually improve our posture, right? So like yes, we could look at the right? So like yes, we could look at the right? So like yes, we could look at the ones with um the the highest score on ones with um the the highest score on ones with um the the highest score on this specific asset, but it's only going this specific asset, but it's only going this specific asset, but it's only going to move the to move the to move the needle very very minimally, right? But needle very very minimally, right? But needle very very minimally, right? But on this asset, if we do the same thing, on this asset, if we do the same thing, on this asset, if we do the same thing, we're like our our posture on that asset we're like our our posture on that asset we're like our our posture on that asset goes, you know, way up. We're we're able goes, you know, way up. We're we're able goes, you know, way up. We're we're able to reduce risk there a lot more. to reduce risk there a lot more. to reduce risk there a lot more. Um so again just delta uh group DPSS is Um so again just delta uh group DPSS is Um so again just delta uh group DPSS is just uh taking the number of CVEes uh on just uh taking the number of CVEes uh on just uh taking the number of CVEes uh on an asset and subtracting um the same an asset and subtracting um the same an asset and subtracting um the same score when you red when you remove said score when you red when you remove said score when you red when you remove said CVE. Um so we getting into okay what CVE. Um so we getting into okay what CVE. Um so we getting into okay what what happens over time right um ideally based off of the decisions um ideally based off of the decisions um ideally based off of the decisions that we're making here we see this that we're making here we see this that we're making here we see this reduce right we see we see we start reduce right we see we see we start reduce right we see we see we start seeing things shift left uh here uh and seeing things shift left uh here uh and seeing things shift left uh here uh and um that's an ideal situation but we all um that's an ideal situation but we all um that's an ideal situation but we all know that we don't live in that world um know that we don't live in that world um know that we don't live in that world um and we're very dependent and we're very dependent and we're very dependent on outside influences such as the on outside influences such as the on outside influences such as the arrival rate of arrival rate of arrival rate of CVES and the um the shifting in EPSS CVES and the um the shifting in EPSS CVES and the um the shifting in EPSS scores on a daily basis. Right? So this scores on a daily basis. Right? So this scores on a daily basis. Right? So this is this this graph in my experience just is this this graph in my experience just is this this graph in my experience just fluctuates um not majorly, right? But on fluctuates um not majorly, right? But on fluctuates um not majorly, right? But on a daily basis you could you could graph a daily basis you could you could graph a daily basis you could you could graph this and see just the fluctuations of this and see just the fluctuations of this and see just the fluctuations of your your posture. Um, and so it's a, in your your posture. Um, and so it's a, in your your posture. Um, and so it's a, in my opinion, it's an it's sort of my opinion, it's an it's sort of my opinion, it's an it's sort of measuring what measuring what measuring what your asset risk posture could be on a your asset risk posture could be on a your asset risk posture could be on a day-to-day basis. And to me, I mean, day-to-day basis. And to me, I mean, day-to-day basis. And to me, I mean, granted, you're doing this on a granted, you're doing this on a granted, you're doing this on a day-to-day basis. You can easily do this day-to-day basis. You can easily do this day-to-day basis. You can easily do this at at a lesser interval, right? Um, but at at a lesser interval, right? Um, but at at a lesser interval, right? Um, but to me, like even if we don't move things to me, like even if we don't move things to me, like even if we don't move things to the left, right? to the left, right? to the left, right? And because we're not in control of the And because we're not in control of the And because we're not in control of the the amount of CVES that are coming into the amount of CVES that are coming into the amount of CVES that are coming into our environment or or um the EPSS our environment or or um the EPSS our environment or or um the EPSS scores, right? It's just giving us a scores, right? It's just giving us a scores, right? It's just giving us a window into reality, right? This is uh window into reality, right? This is uh window into reality, right? This is uh sort of okay, I'm I'm I'm able to sort sort of okay, I'm I'm I'm able to sort sort of okay, I'm I'm I'm able to sort of clear some of the fog of war here. Um of clear some of the fog of war here. Um of clear some of the fog of war here. Um it gives us just more information, it gives us just more information, it gives us just more information, right? And more information uh in right? And more information uh in right? And more information uh in vulnerability management means I can vulnerability management means I can vulnerability management means I can make better decisions. Um so I really make better decisions. Um so I really make better decisions. Um so I really sort of see this as more of like a sort of see this as more of like a sort of see this as more of like a decision support mechanism where we are decision support mechanism where we are decision support mechanism where we are looking at the things that are the most looking at the things that are the most looking at the things that are the most risky to the organization risky to the organization risky to the organization um and uh you know putting our effort um and uh you know putting our effort um and uh you know putting our effort there right and so you know one example there right and so you know one example there right and so you know one example is you know say you know you're a is you know say you know you're a is you know say you know you're a vulnerability management program manager vulnerability management program manager vulnerability management program manager and your syso is telling you oh my top and your syso is telling you oh my top and your syso is telling you oh my top priority is data security this year priority is data security this year priority is data security this year right right right um you can use this as a way for the um you can use this as a way for the um you can use this as a way for the vulnerability management program to vulnerability management program to vulnerability management program to effectively start addressing the things effectively start addressing the things effectively start addressing the things that matter most to the system. Right? that matter most to the system. Right? that matter most to the system. Right? You can if you map these things You can if you map these things You can if you map these things together, you can you can come back and together, you can you can come back and together, you can you can come back and say this asset say this asset say this asset is 95% likely to have exploitation is 95% likely to have exploitation is 95% likely to have exploitation activity associated with it in the wild activity associated with it in the wild activity associated with it in the wild and it also processes our most sensitive and it also processes our most sensitive and it also processes our most sensitive information. Right? That's one statement information. Right? That's one statement information. Right? That's one statement that we can make. Um granted it's not that we can make. Um granted it's not that we can make. Um granted it's not the complete picture but it is a start the complete picture but it is a start the complete picture but it is a start right it does give us um a leg up into right it does give us um a leg up into right it does give us um a leg up into understanding you know the the the risk understanding you know the the the risk understanding you know the the the risk that our assets may be posing to the that our assets may be posing to the that our assets may be posing to the organization. Um, and with that, uh, we organization. Um, and with that, uh, we organization. Um, and with that, uh, we have some takeaways. And if you look have some takeaways. And if you look have some takeaways. And if you look Bluey, Bluey, Bluey, uh, right there, it's another good slide uh, right there, it's another good slide uh, right there, it's another good slide to to stop on. Great presentation. Thank you. on. Great presentation. Thank you. on. Great presentation. Thank you. Did you when you were messaging this Did you when you were messaging this Did you when you were messaging this data, did you take the data about the data, did you take the data about the data, did you take the data about the group EPSS score from the highest group EPSS score from the highest group EPSS score from the highest probability of being exploited assets probability of being exploited assets probability of being exploited assets and analyze how removing what was the and analyze how removing what was the and analyze how removing what was the tipping point? How many of those tipping point? How many of those tipping point? How many of those vulnerabilities will need to be vulnerabilities will need to be vulnerabilities will need to be remediated? Do you see any trend to move remediated? Do you see any trend to move remediated? Do you see any trend to move it from the 1.0 zero to the it from the 1.0 zero to the it from the 1.0 zero to the um yeah so going back to this right like um yeah so going back to this right like um yeah so going back to this right like is this can we do n minus2 n minus 3 n is this can we do n minus2 n minus 3 n is this can we do n minus2 n minus 3 n minus4 minus4 minus4 absolutely where is the tipping point absolutely where is the tipping point absolutely where is the tipping point exactly um have I done that maybe once exactly um have I done that maybe once exactly um have I done that maybe once right I'm I'm doing this I'm researching right I'm I'm doing this I'm researching right I'm I'm doing this I'm researching this in my free time right but also this in my free time right but also this in my free time right but also semi-p profofessionally as well right um semi-p profofessionally as well right um semi-p profofessionally as well right um I this this conversation I this this conversation I this this conversation in this presentation, I I hope you take in this presentation, I I hope you take in this presentation, I I hope you take away go look at your data and see what away go look at your data and see what away go look at your data and see what it tells you and whether or not you can it tells you and whether or not you can it tells you and whether or not you can actually make better decisions because actually make better decisions because actually make better decisions because of it. And to your point, a tipping of it. And to your point, a tipping of it. And to your point, a tipping point is a great place to look at, point is a great place to look at, point is a great place to look at, right? Like for this specific asset, how right? Like for this specific asset, how right? Like for this specific asset, how many do I have to fix in order for it to many do I have to fix in order for it to many do I have to fix in order for it to be below my threshold of of tolerance, be below my threshold of of tolerance, be below my threshold of of tolerance, right? Like I can set a tolerance at the right? Like I can set a tolerance at the right? Like I can set a tolerance at the CVE level, at the EPSS score level. I CVE level, at the EPSS score level. I CVE level, at the EPSS score level. I can set a tolerance at the asset level. can set a tolerance at the asset level. can set a tolerance at the asset level. Yeah. Um, so Yeah. Um, so Yeah. Um, so takeaways, none of what I just said takeaways, none of what I just said takeaways, none of what I just said substitutes for good patch management. substitutes for good patch management. substitutes for good patch management. So please don't take that away, right? So please don't take that away, right? So please don't take that away, right? Please be doing that. That's a that's a Please be doing that. That's a that's a Please be doing that. That's a that's a very difficult problem to solve. Uh, very difficult problem to solve. Uh, very difficult problem to solve. Uh, that's not the problem I'm solving here. that's not the problem I'm solving here. that's not the problem I'm solving here. Um, I know firsthand how difficult that Um, I know firsthand how difficult that Um, I know firsthand how difficult that is. is. is. Um it also provides a lens into your Um it also provides a lens into your Um it also provides a lens into your vulnerability risk posture. Right? If if vulnerability risk posture. Right? If if vulnerability risk posture. Right? If if we say risk is impact a function of we say risk is impact a function of we say risk is impact a function of impact and likelihood, we have impact and likelihood, we have impact and likelihood, we have likelihood based off of EPSS at the likelihood based off of EPSS at the likelihood based off of EPSS at the asset level um or at another grouping asset level um or at another grouping asset level um or at another grouping level, right? And then if we have a good level, right? And then if we have a good level, right? And then if we have a good asset asset asset inventory, haha, um we uh we can marry inventory, haha, um we uh we can marry inventory, haha, um we uh we can marry that with other data sets uh such as you that with other data sets uh such as you that with other data sets uh such as you know how important this asset is to the know how important this asset is to the know how important this asset is to the organization, what is it doing, who owns organization, what is it doing, who owns organization, what is it doing, who owns it, blah blah blah blah blah. Like it it, blah blah blah blah blah. Like it it, blah blah blah blah blah. Like it gives us a nice way to sort of frame our gives us a nice way to sort of frame our gives us a nice way to sort of frame our problem, our risk problem, our risk problem, our risk posture. The other thing is it helps to posture. The other thing is it helps to posture. The other thing is it helps to prioritize by riskiest asset or other prioritize by riskiest asset or other prioritize by riskiest asset or other grouping. Right? I I I struggle with grouping. Right? I I I struggle with grouping. Right? I I I struggle with this a lot, right? I I look at um this a lot, right? I I look at um this a lot, right? I I look at um vulnerability data on a daily basis and vulnerability data on a daily basis and vulnerability data on a daily basis and I I see, you know, what are the top I I see, you know, what are the top I I see, you know, what are the top things I need to fix, but nothing really things I need to fix, but nothing really things I need to fix, but nothing really uh tells us which ones are which assets uh tells us which ones are which assets uh tells us which ones are which assets are the riskiest, right? Like sure, like are the riskiest, right? Like sure, like are the riskiest, right? Like sure, like your products in in your in your your products in in your in your your products in in your in your environment are going to have you like a environment are going to have you like a environment are going to have you like a risk score or something like that. I risk score or something like that. I risk score or something like that. I really never know what those mean. Um I really never know what those mean. Um I really never know what those mean. Um I want to know what's in my environment. want to know what's in my environment. want to know what's in my environment. um and cod like h with um and cod like h with um and cod like h with codified business context and looking at codified business context and looking at codified business context and looking at the exploitation in the wild and the exploitation in the wild and the exploitation in the wild and marrying those two marrying those two marrying those two together and again uh like I said before together and again uh like I said before together and again uh like I said before um you might not have the the desired um you might not have the the desired um you might not have the the desired effect based off your actions but that effect based off your actions but that effect based off your actions but that doesn't mean you're failing um it uh it doesn't mean you're failing um it uh it doesn't mean you're failing um it uh it means that you're making smarter means that you're making smarter means that you're making smarter decisions right um So the last takeaway decisions right um So the last takeaway decisions right um So the last takeaway I'd give uh is it's a decision support I'd give uh is it's a decision support I'd give uh is it's a decision support mechanism and it indicates which assets mechanism and it indicates which assets mechanism and it indicates which assets or groups require additional effort that or groups require additional effort that or groups require additional effort that you may not have known about beforehand. you may not have known about beforehand. you may not have known about beforehand. Uh and so with that that's it. that that's it. that that's it. Thank you. We do have time for maybe one quick We do have time for maybe one quick We do have time for maybe one quick question. Yeah. question. Yeah. question. Yeah. Hey Stephen, great great talk. Thanks Hey Stephen, great great talk. Thanks Hey Stephen, great great talk. Thanks for showing all that data. But I I think for showing all that data. But I I think for showing all that data. But I I think there's a really interesting opportunity there's a really interesting opportunity there's a really interesting opportunity and you kind of hinted at it of being and you kind of hinted at it of being and you kind of hinted at it of being able to see in an environment how risk able to see in an environment how risk able to see in an environment how risk can change. Yep. You can see and see can change. Yep. You can see and see can change. Yep. You can see and see where your efforts are targeted. I mean, where your efforts are targeted. I mean, where your efforts are targeted. I mean, are you are you looking at building some are you are you looking at building some are you are you looking at building some of that in and showing how remediation of that in and showing how remediation of that in and showing how remediation efforts in an environment can move the efforts in an environment can move the efforts in an environment can move the needle and you can see where your needle and you can see where your needle and you can see where your efforts are most effective at changing efforts are most effective at changing efforts are most effective at changing that? Um yeah I I didn't put this slide in and Um yeah I I didn't put this slide in and Um yeah I I didn't put this slide in and I have a bunch of notes just what this I have a bunch of notes just what this I have a bunch of notes just what this whatever um grouping EPSS at the action whatever um grouping EPSS at the action whatever um grouping EPSS at the action level right like we could do something level right like we could do something level right like we could do something like that right granted we have that like that right granted we have that like that right granted we have that that data available to us I mean a lot that data available to us I mean a lot that data available to us I mean a lot of the problem that I have right now is of the problem that I have right now is of the problem that I have right now is okay I have some set okay I have some set okay I have some set of remediations that I know about okay of remediations that I know about okay of remediations that I know about okay great I'll take that can I say which great I'll take that can I say which great I'll take that can I say which ones have the most impact. Yeah, ones have the most impact. Yeah, ones have the most impact. Yeah, exactly. Thanks,
