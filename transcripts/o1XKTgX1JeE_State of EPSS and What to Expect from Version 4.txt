Kind: captions Language: en All right. Thank you. I It's always fun All right. Thank you. I It's always fun All right. Thank you. I It's always fun to present data visualizations because to present data visualizations because to present data visualizations because these two mounds are these two mounds are these two mounds are green. So I think this will be an green. So I think this will be an green. So I think this will be an interesting uh voyage through my data interesting uh voyage through my data interesting uh voyage through my data visualizations. Um I actually want to visualizations. Um I actually want to visualizations. Um I actually want to start out with a quick story because I start out with a quick story because I start out with a quick story because I was trying to think of where to take was trying to think of where to take was trying to think of where to take this talk and where the things that I this talk and where the things that I this talk and where the things that I would want to highlight. And one of the would want to highlight. And one of the would want to highlight. And one of the things that I wanted to do first, I've things that I wanted to do first, I've things that I wanted to do first, I've I've been feeling a little bit nostalgic I've been feeling a little bit nostalgic I've been feeling a little bit nostalgic recently about EPSS and where we've been recently about EPSS and where we've been recently about EPSS and where we've been and how far we've come and the I was and how far we've come and the I was and how far we've come and the I was thinking of a story from I think it was thinking of a story from I think it was thinking of a story from I think it was like 2009 2010. I was working in a large like 2009 2010. I was working in a large like 2009 2010. I was working in a large enterprise and at the time there was a enterprise and at the time there was a enterprise and at the time there was a large debate on whether to disable USB large debate on whether to disable USB large debate on whether to disable USB thumb drives that there was a lot of thumb drives that there was a lot of thumb drives that there was a lot of malware going around. There's a lot of malware going around. There's a lot of malware going around. There's a lot of debate. There are a lot of um excited debate. There are a lot of um excited debate. There are a lot of um excited security people. Uh some people saying security people. Uh some people saying security people. Uh some people saying that those we need to do this because of that those we need to do this because of that those we need to do this because of the malware and other people saying, you the malware and other people saying, you the malware and other people saying, you know, we had like 4,000 IT people in know, we had like 4,000 IT people in know, we had like 4,000 IT people in this organization and the the thumb this organization and the the thumb this organization and the the thumb drive was a valid use of transferring drive was a valid use of transferring drive was a valid use of transferring data. And it ended up that we made this data. And it ended up that we made this data. And it ended up that we made this call and all all thumb drives were call and all all thumb drives were call and all all thumb drives were disabled. And about two months later, um disabled. And about two months later, um disabled. And about two months later, um I was talking to the CISO and I said, I was talking to the CISO and I said, I was talking to the CISO and I said, "How did that work "How did that work "How did that work out? Was that decision really good? How out? Was that decision really good? How out? Was that decision really good? How like how many complaints did you get and like how many complaints did you get and like how many complaints did you get and how much did the malware go down? And he how much did the malware go down? And he how much did the malware go down? And he said, "Oh, I don't know. We didn't look said, "Oh, I don't know. We didn't look said, "Oh, I don't know. We didn't look we didn't we didn't look at any of we didn't we didn't look at any of we didn't we didn't look at any of that." And that was the end of the that." And that was the end of the that." And that was the end of the conversation. We never talked about conversation. We never talked about conversation. We never talked about thumb drives again and it remained thumb drives again and it remained thumb drives again and it remained disabled. And that always stuck with me. disabled. And that always stuck with me. disabled. And that always stuck with me. That always bugged me that that feedback That always bugged me that that feedback That always bugged me that that feedback loop. And that that during that time and loop. And that that during that time and loop. And that that during that time and just before that, I was really excited just before that, I was really excited just before that, I was really excited about trying to understand how do we about trying to understand how do we about trying to understand how do we learn things? How do we know things? And learn things? How do we know things? And learn things? How do we know things? And a lot of the research came back to a lot of the research came back to a lot of the research came back to feedback. When we do something, we get feedback. When we do something, we get feedback. When we do something, we get feedback on that. And that feedback, if feedback on that. And that feedback, if feedback on that. And that feedback, if it's timely, accurate, we can understand it's timely, accurate, we can understand it's timely, accurate, we can understand it, we learn, right? And so thinking it, we learn, right? And so thinking it, we learn, right? And so thinking about EPSS, this this is one of the about EPSS, this this is one of the about EPSS, this this is one of the fundamental things in EPSS that it's fundamental things in EPSS that it's fundamental things in EPSS that it's built on feedback. built on feedback. built on feedback. It's not built on what we feel would be It's not built on what we feel would be It's not built on what we feel would be a bad thing or what we consider to be a bad thing or what we consider to be a bad thing or what we consider to be risk or risky or whatever. It is built risk or risky or whatever. It is built risk or risky or whatever. It is built on objective information. So EPSS is on objective information. So EPSS is on objective information. So EPSS is built on observed exploitation activity built on observed exploitation activity built on observed exploitation activity being recorded with a being recorded with a being recorded with a timestamp and it it's dynamic. Uh as timestamp and it it's dynamic. Uh as timestamp and it it's dynamic. Uh as I'll talk about how this whole thing I'll talk about how this whole thing I'll talk about how this whole thing works, we'll see it's dynamic. It's works, we'll see it's dynamic. It's works, we'll see it's dynamic. It's going to update with new information. We going to update with new information. We going to update with new information. We produce scores daily. um the predictions produce scores daily. um the predictions produce scores daily. um the predictions are measurable and this is a really are measurable and this is a really are measurable and this is a really really really key point that as we make really really key point that as we make really really key point that as we make predictions we want to go back and predictions we want to go back and predictions we want to go back and measure and that's exactly what we're measure and that's exactly what we're measure and that's exactly what we're going to do and I'm going to talk about going to do and I'm going to talk about going to do and I'm going to talk about that today we're going to show how that today we're going to show how that today we're going to show how measurable how good things are measurable how good things are measurable how good things are performing and spoiler it's not perfect performing and spoiler it's not perfect performing and spoiler it's not perfect we'll just get that out of the way up we'll just get that out of the way up we'll just get that out of the way up front it is not perfect front it is not perfect front it is not perfect uh and nothing here is invented we don't uh and nothing here is invented we don't uh and nothing here is invented we don't have any framework we don't have any have any framework we don't have any have any framework we don't have any taxonomy there's no definition page age taxonomy there's no definition page age taxonomy there's no definition page age where we try to define threat just the where we try to define threat just the where we try to define threat just the right way or anything like that. Um, and right way or anything like that. Um, and right way or anything like that. Um, and so there's there's nothing invented. so there's there's nothing invented. so there's there's nothing invented. We're just taking the data that we We're just taking the data that we We're just taking the data that we observe, the exploitation data that we observe, the exploitation data that we observe, the exploitation data that we observe and trying to produce a observe and trying to produce a observe and trying to produce a predictive predictive predictive score. And again, we are continually score. And again, we are continually score. And again, we are continually improving. We just released improving. We just released improving. We just released EPSSV4 last March 17th, which EPSSV4 last March 17th, which EPSSV4 last March 17th, which is two weeks is two weeks is two weeks ago. On the right side of this slide, ago. On the right side of this slide, ago. On the right side of this slide, you'll see this is the output, the the you'll see this is the output, the the you'll see this is the output, the the three columns. This is everything that three columns. This is everything that three columns. This is everything that I've been working on for the last five I've been working on for the last five I've been working on for the last five six years summed up in three columns and six years summed up in three columns and six years summed up in three columns and it goes 270ome thousand long. Obviously it goes 270ome thousand long. Obviously it goes 270ome thousand long. Obviously it's a snippet. Uh but basically this is it's a snippet. Uh but basically this is it's a snippet. Uh but basically this is what it outputs. We got a CVE the EPSS what it outputs. We got a CVE the EPSS what it outputs. We got a CVE the EPSS score in the middle and the percentile. score in the middle and the percentile. score in the middle and the percentile. And I'll talk about what those And I'll talk about what those And I'll talk about what those represent. I've got a whole section in represent. I've got a whole section in represent. I've got a whole section in here to talk about it. But and these are here to talk about it. But and these are here to talk about it. But and these are elements about EPSS. Again, what APSS is elements about EPSS. Again, what APSS is elements about EPSS. Again, what APSS is predicting, it's a predictive model, and predicting, it's a predictive model, and predicting, it's a predictive model, and it's estimating the probability, which it's estimating the probability, which it's estimating the probability, which is a key thing, is a key thing, is a key thing, probability of exploitation activity probability of exploitation activity probability of exploitation activity being observed in the next 30 days. And being observed in the next 30 days. And being observed in the next 30 days. And one of the key things to talk about is one of the key things to talk about is one of the key things to talk about is exploitation activity, not necessarily exploitation activity, not necessarily exploitation activity, not necessarily successful exploitation. These are successful exploitation. These are successful exploitation. These are typically things caught by security typically things caught by security typically things caught by security devices, IPS, IDS, honeypotss, malware devices, IPS, IDS, honeypotss, malware devices, IPS, IDS, honeypotss, malware detections, malware analysis. And so detections, malware analysis. And so detections, malware analysis. And so these are not necessarily successful, these are not necessarily successful, these are not necessarily successful, but they are evidence of activity of but they are evidence of activity of but they are evidence of activity of attackers wanting to do something. Um, attackers wanting to do something. Um, attackers wanting to do something. Um, most of the time attackers, there's also most of the time attackers, there's also most of the time attackers, there's also the gray noise problem of people trying the gray noise problem of people trying the gray noise problem of people trying to do the right thing or scanning the to do the right thing or scanning the to do the right thing or scanning the internet for vulnerabilities to research internet for vulnerabilities to research internet for vulnerabilities to research or do whatever. or do whatever. or do whatever. Um, and we're going to talk about the Um, and we're going to talk about the Um, and we're going to talk about the the rest of the things in here, but that the rest of the things in here, but that the rest of the things in here, but that first point about 30 days being a quote first point about 30 days being a quote first point about 30 days being a quote unquote magic number, it's largely unquote magic number, it's largely unquote magic number, it's largely arbitrary, the fact that we chose 30 arbitrary, the fact that we chose 30 arbitrary, the fact that we chose 30 days. But if we made it 7 days or we had days. But if we made it 7 days or we had days. But if we made it 7 days or we had someone who wanted to make it 12 months someone who wanted to make it 12 months someone who wanted to make it 12 months that he wanted to do annual planning for that he wanted to do annual planning for that he wanted to do annual planning for vulnerabilities and when we looked at it vulnerabilities and when we looked at it vulnerabilities and when we looked at it and we ran ran the model and tried to and we ran ran the model and tried to and we ran ran the model and tried to figure it out, everything was largely figure it out, everything was largely figure it out, everything was largely the same order. just the the ratio the the same order. just the the ratio the the same order. just the the ratio the the amount of probability um just scaled the amount of probability um just scaled the amount of probability um just scaled according to the according to the according to the time. All right, let's talk about uh how time. All right, let's talk about uh how time. All right, let's talk about uh how we measure accuracy of a model here. And we measure accuracy of a model here. And we measure accuracy of a model here. And these are concepts again not invented. these are concepts again not invented. these are concepts again not invented. These are concepts called precision and These are concepts called precision and These are concepts called precision and recall. Um but we call them efficiency recall. Um but we call them efficiency recall. Um but we call them efficiency and coverage because it's more in tune and coverage because it's more in tune and coverage because it's more in tune with vulnerability management and with vulnerability management and with vulnerability management and precision and recall are pretty precision and recall are pretty precision and recall are pretty confusing terms. Um, but essentially confusing terms. Um, but essentially confusing terms. Um, but essentially what we have in this plot, if we can see what we have in this plot, if we can see what we have in this plot, if we can see it, there's a large circle. If you can it, there's a large circle. If you can it, there's a large circle. If you can see the large circle, see the large circle, see the large circle, uh, it represents all CVEes. You really uh, it represents all CVEes. You really uh, it represents all CVEes. You really can't see that at all, can you? The can't see that at all, can you? The can't see that at all, can you? The large circle. All right, cool. Well, large circle. All right, cool. Well, large circle. All right, cool. Well, there's a large circle that represents there's a large circle that represents there's a large circle that represents all CVEes. And inside of that are two all CVEes. And inside of that are two all CVEes. And inside of that are two smaller circles. And the the blue one smaller circles. And the the blue one smaller circles. And the the blue one here represents uh CVSS criticals nine here represents uh CVSS criticals nine here represents uh CVSS criticals nine and above. And then the the what is and above. And then the the what is and above. And then the the what is clearly a red circle right here is the clearly a red circle right here is the clearly a red circle right here is the exploited activity. I think this was exploited activity. I think this was exploited activity. I think this was February 1st for the next 30 days. Oh February 1st for the next 30 days. Oh February 1st for the next 30 days. Oh no, this is before this is last summer. no, this is before this is last summer. no, this is before this is last summer. But I looked at the CVSS scores on one But I looked at the CVSS scores on one But I looked at the CVSS scores on one day and I watched the exploitation day and I watched the exploitation day and I watched the exploitation activity for the next 30 days and this activity for the next 30 days and this activity for the next 30 days and this is what we saw. So if you prioritized is what we saw. So if you prioritized is what we saw. So if you prioritized all the CVSS 9 and above on that day out all the CVSS 9 and above on that day out all the CVSS 9 and above on that day out of all the vulnerabilities you would get of all the vulnerabilities you would get of all the vulnerabilities you would get this blue circle and then the red is this blue circle and then the red is this blue circle and then the red is what I saw exploited. So there's three what I saw exploited. So there's three what I saw exploited. So there's three things we can talk about and I largely things we can talk about and I largely things we can talk about and I largely focus on the last two. We can talk about focus on the last two. We can talk about focus on the last two. We can talk about the level of effort. How many are CVS 9 the level of effort. How many are CVS 9 the level of effort. How many are CVS 9 and above? And it's 21% at that time of and above? And it's 21% at that time of and above? And it's 21% at that time of all published vulnerabilities. One in all published vulnerabilities. One in all published vulnerabilities. One in five were more five were more five were more critical and that's what effort is. So critical and that's what effort is. So critical and that's what effort is. So 21%. Efficiency is basically how 21%. Efficiency is basically how 21%. Efficiency is basically how efficient is your dollar spent. Right? efficient is your dollar spent. Right? efficient is your dollar spent. Right? We're doing the blue. How much of that We're doing the blue. How much of that We're doing the blue. How much of that blue is covered into the red. So if the blue is covered into the red. So if the blue is covered into the red. So if the circles were overlapping, if the blue circles were overlapping, if the blue circles were overlapping, if the blue were completely inside the red, you'd were completely inside the red, you'd were completely inside the red, you'd have 100% efficiency. Every dollar that have 100% efficiency. Every dollar that have 100% efficiency. Every dollar that you're spending to to remediate is going you're spending to to remediate is going you're spending to to remediate is going to be things that are to be things that are to be things that are exploited. The other side of that is exploited. The other side of that is exploited. The other side of that is coverage. how much of the exploited coverage. how much of the exploited coverage. how much of the exploited vulnerabilities are being covered by vulnerabilities are being covered by vulnerabilities are being covered by your remediation effort. Um, and you can your remediation effort. Um, and you can your remediation effort. Um, and you can see in this one there's a lot of blue see in this one there's a lot of blue see in this one there's a lot of blue not in the red and this is I'm sure it's not in the red and this is I'm sure it's not in the red and this is I'm sure it's on there on there on there somewhere. Nope. But I mean roughly it's somewhere. Nope. But I mean roughly it's somewhere. Nope. But I mean roughly it's about what is that 20% 15%. I don't about what is that 20% 15%. I don't about what is that 20% 15%. I don't know. So the efficiency is relatively know. So the efficiency is relatively know. So the efficiency is relatively low in this one because there's a lot of low in this one because there's a lot of low in this one because there's a lot of blue not covered by the red and the blue not covered by the red and the blue not covered by the red and the coverage is pretty good probably 40% coverage is pretty good probably 40% coverage is pretty good probably 40% here you know out of everything being here you know out of everything being here you know out of everything being exploited CVSS9 and above would get you exploited CVSS9 and above would get you exploited CVSS9 and above would get you 30 40% or 30 40% or 30 40% or so. So this is where we start. Now, if so. So this is where we start. Now, if so. So this is where we start. Now, if we look at real data, these are we look at real data, these are we look at real data, these are attributes of vulnerabilities. And if we attributes of vulnerabilities. And if we attributes of vulnerabilities. And if we look at those attributes and say, I'm look at those attributes and say, I'm look at those attributes and say, I'm going to prioritize on that. None of going to prioritize on that. None of going to prioritize on that. None of which is a good strategy. But let's just which is a good strategy. But let's just which is a good strategy. But let's just say that let's say when we look at say that let's say when we look at say that let's say when we look at something tagged with remote, what if we something tagged with remote, what if we something tagged with remote, what if we just remediated everything remote? And just remediated everything remote? And just remediated everything remote? And you first you see it pretty big. So you first you see it pretty big. So you first you see it pretty big. So that's a level of effort. You also see that's a level of effort. You also see that's a level of effort. You also see the coverage here going this way just the coverage here going this way just the coverage here going this way just over 60%. So if you just patched over 60%. So if you just patched over 60%. So if you just patched everything marked remote, you would be everything marked remote, you would be everything marked remote, you would be getting 60% getting 60% getting 60% coverage. You'd be rather inefficient coverage. You'd be rather inefficient coverage. You'd be rather inefficient about about about 10%. So all of the effort about one in 10%. So all of the effort about one in 10%. So all of the effort about one in 10 are actually going to be exploited. 10 are actually going to be exploited. 10 are actually going to be exploited. Nine and 10 aren't exploited in the next Nine and 10 aren't exploited in the next Nine and 10 aren't exploited in the next 30 days. So it's not very efficient. But 30 days. So it's not very efficient. But 30 days. So it's not very efficient. But then you see as you come over here, you then you see as you come over here, you then you see as you come over here, you get like exploit DB is right here. ZDI, get like exploit DB is right here. ZDI, get like exploit DB is right here. ZDI, GitHub exploits, nuclei, and as you go GitHub exploits, nuclei, and as you go GitHub exploits, nuclei, and as you go up that left, you start getting thread up that left, you start getting thread up that left, you start getting thread intel. intel. intel. You see this is where siz kev if it's on You see this is where siz kev if it's on You see this is where siz kev if it's on the kev we get pretty good efficiency. A the kev we get pretty good efficiency. A the kev we get pretty good efficiency. A lot of the things that we see in kev we lot of the things that we see in kev we lot of the things that we see in kev we also see exploitation activity in the also see exploitation activity in the also see exploitation activity in the next 30 days. So if it was added to the next 30 days. So if it was added to the next 30 days. So if it was added to the kev a month ago and we're looking at it kev a month ago and we're looking at it kev a month ago and we're looking at it in this particular sample about 65% were in this particular sample about 65% were in this particular sample about 65% were exploited in the next 30 days in this exploited in the next 30 days in this exploited in the next 30 days in this sample. Metas-ploit even higher more sample. Metas-ploit even higher more sample. Metas-ploit even higher more efficient a little bit more to the efficient a little bit more to the efficient a little bit more to the right. So, we're getting more efficient right. So, we're getting more efficient right. So, we're getting more efficient and a little bit more coverage than Kev and a little bit more coverage than Kev and a little bit more coverage than Kev in this data set. And this is really in this data set. And this is really in this data set. And this is really what we're starting with. What we want what we're starting with. What we want what we're starting with. What we want to do is move this to the upper right. to do is move this to the upper right. to do is move this to the upper right. We want to get something to the upper We want to get something to the upper We want to get something to the upper right. So, let's start here. And let's right. So, let's start here. And let's right. So, let's start here. And let's say, you know, we could start to do say, you know, we could start to do say, you know, we could start to do simple things like what if we did Kev simple things like what if we did Kev simple things like what if we did Kev and Metas-ploit and Intrigue and Sniper and Metas-ploit and Intrigue and Sniper and Metas-ploit and Intrigue and Sniper and Jails, right? What if we did all of and Jails, right? What if we did all of and Jails, right? What if we did all of those? How would we do? We can do things those? How would we do? We can do things those? How would we do? We can do things like that. But let's just go to sort of like that. But let's just go to sort of like that. But let's just go to sort of simple things. This is simple things. This is simple things. This is CVSS. If we take all the vulnerabilities CVSS. If we take all the vulnerabilities CVSS. If we take all the vulnerabilities and we said we're going to do 10 and and we said we're going to do 10 and and we said we're going to do 10 and above, we're getting about 10% coverage above, we're getting about 10% coverage above, we're getting about 10% coverage and I don't know 18% and I don't know 18% and I don't know 18% efficiency and so on and so forth. And efficiency and so on and so forth. And efficiency and so on and so forth. And we're sort of hugging down here. By this we're sort of hugging down here. By this we're sort of hugging down here. By this point, we're just sort of random chance point, we're just sort of random chance point, we're just sort of random chance right even there. Um, and this is what right even there. Um, and this is what right even there. Um, and this is what CVS looks like. So one of the first CVS looks like. So one of the first CVS looks like. So one of the first things we did with EPSS, we said this is things we did with EPSS, we said this is things we did with EPSS, we said this is our target. We want to do better than our target. We want to do better than our target. We want to do better than this. Right now CVSS was not made to this. Right now CVSS was not made to this. Right now CVSS was not made to predict exploitation activity. Um and predict exploitation activity. Um and predict exploitation activity. Um and it's a little unfair to do this, but I it's a little unfair to do this, but I it's a little unfair to do this, but I think a lot of people think it's going think a lot of people think it's going think a lot of people think it's going to be to be to be correlated, right? You can't really have correlated, right? You can't really have correlated, right? You can't really have risk or severity or whatever else if risk or severity or whatever else if risk or severity or whatever else if there's not exploitation activity. So there's not exploitation activity. So there's not exploitation activity. So naturally, you would expect some naturally, you would expect some naturally, you would expect some correlation. So this is what we have to correlation. So this is what we have to correlation. So this is what we have to do. we have to beat this. The first do. we have to beat this. The first do. we have to beat this. The first version of version of version of EPSS looks like EPSS looks like EPSS looks like this. Uh and each dot here is basically this. Uh and each dot here is basically this. Uh and each dot here is basically a threshold. Like if we said let's you a threshold. Like if we said let's you a threshold. Like if we said let's you know fix EPSS 50% and above uh on a know fix EPSS 50% and above uh on a know fix EPSS 50% and above uh on a specific day this ran for you know just specific day this ran for you know just specific day this ran for you know just under a year. Um so we get all these under a year. Um so we get all these under a year. Um so we get all these different thresholds all these different different thresholds all these different different thresholds all these different days and all these points coming through days and all these points coming through days and all these points coming through here. And so that's what EPSS1 looked here. And so that's what EPSS1 looked here. And so that's what EPSS1 looked like. Uh for this particular data like. Uh for this particular data like. Uh for this particular data looking back in time, metas-ploit was looking back in time, metas-ploit was looking back in time, metas-ploit was and Kev would outperform EPSS and Kev would outperform EPSS and Kev would outperform EPSS uh in the higher end from a uh uh in the higher end from a uh uh in the higher end from a uh efficiency and coverage on the higher efficiency and coverage on the higher efficiency and coverage on the higher end. And that's pretty interesting. Then end. And that's pretty interesting. Then end. And that's pretty interesting. Then in this one, we had 16 variables. By the in this one, we had 16 variables. By the in this one, we had 16 variables. By the way, the first model 16 variables, it way, the first model 16 variables, it way, the first model 16 variables, it was meant to be done in a spreadsheet was meant to be done in a spreadsheet was meant to be done in a spreadsheet and so everybody had to collect their and so everybody had to collect their and so everybody had to collect their own data. But then we figured out we own data. But then we figured out we own data. But then we figured out we could centralize it. we could run an could centralize it. we could run an could centralize it. we could run an API. We could get into the 2000s and run API. We could get into the 2000s and run API. We could get into the 2000s and run an API and not do it in a spreadsheet, an API and not do it in a spreadsheet, an API and not do it in a spreadsheet, not ask everybody to collect data. So, not ask everybody to collect data. So, not ask everybody to collect data. So, we increased it in 2022 and this is we increased it in 2022 and this is we increased it in 2022 and this is version two where we went to a version two where we went to a version two where we went to a centralized model. We had I think over a centralized model. We had I think over a centralized model. We had I think over a thousand around a thousand features, thousand around a thousand features, thousand around a thousand features, thousands different variables in there thousands different variables in there thousands different variables in there looking at that and now we're now we're looking at that and now we're now we're looking at that and now we're now we're beating beating beating everything. We're clearly doing better everything. We're clearly doing better everything. We're clearly doing better than CVSS. um we're beating any than CVSS. um we're beating any than CVSS. um we're beating any individual metric. We got a lot of lift individual metric. We got a lot of lift individual metric. We got a lot of lift in the center here, which is what we in the center here, which is what we in the center here, which is what we want to do. And even down on the lower want to do. And even down on the lower want to do. And even down on the lower end, we're outperforming end, we're outperforming end, we're outperforming it. Version three comes around in 2023, it. Version three comes around in 2023, it. Version three comes around in 2023, and we get this. Now, we're getting and we get this. Now, we're getting and we get this. Now, we're getting somewhere, right? We're getting a whole somewhere, right? We're getting a whole somewhere, right? We're getting a whole bunch of lift. Um this ran for 2 years, bunch of lift. Um this ran for 2 years, bunch of lift. Um this ran for 2 years, which is pretty much my my mistake. Um which is pretty much my my mistake. Um which is pretty much my my mistake. Um because we're seeing that you see that because we're seeing that you see that because we're seeing that you see that spread in the dots. That's because when spread in the dots. That's because when spread in the dots. That's because when we first trained it, it was up to the we first trained it, it was up to the we first trained it, it was up to the right and over the two years it sort of right and over the two years it sort of right and over the two years it sort of dropped down decaying over time, which I dropped down decaying over time, which I dropped down decaying over time, which I think is pretty interesting, right? We think is pretty interesting, right? We think is pretty interesting, right? We shouldn't wait two years to retune this. shouldn't wait two years to retune this. shouldn't wait two years to retune this. We need to keep it a little bit more We need to keep it a little bit more We need to keep it a little bit more current. Um, but we did greatly improve current. Um, but we did greatly improve current. Um, but we did greatly improve the features doing this. Now, V4, it's a the features doing this. Now, V4, it's a the features doing this. Now, V4, it's a little hard to talk about performance of little hard to talk about performance of little hard to talk about performance of V4 because it was just released uh March V4 because it was just released uh March V4 because it was just released uh March 17th and we haven't even had 30 days 17th and we haven't even had 30 days 17th and we haven't even had 30 days yet. But in the training of it, I got a yet. But in the training of it, I got a yet. But in the training of it, I got a essentially an estimated performance of essentially an estimated performance of essentially an estimated performance of the model and how we think V4 is going the model and how we think V4 is going the model and how we think V4 is going to perform in reality. And this is where to perform in reality. And this is where to perform in reality. And this is where the line the line the line is right is right is right here, which is super interesting. It's here, which is super interesting. It's here, which is super interesting. It's not outperforming where V3 started, but not outperforming where V3 started, but not outperforming where V3 started, but look at the two ends. If you look way up look at the two ends. If you look way up look at the two ends. If you look way up on top, it's almost hugging the top. And on top, it's almost hugging the top. And on top, it's almost hugging the top. And this is saying at the higher end, it's this is saying at the higher end, it's this is saying at the higher end, it's really, really accurate. It's really really, really accurate. It's really really, really accurate. It's really good at the higher end. And then look good at the higher end. And then look good at the higher end. And then look down here at this end. You can see it's down here at this end. You can see it's down here at this end. You can see it's up towards the the upper end down here. up towards the the upper end down here. up towards the the upper end down here. On the lower end, it's doing better than On the lower end, it's doing better than On the lower end, it's doing better than V3. But in between, we're coming down a V3. But in between, we're coming down a V3. But in between, we're coming down a little bit. And I have some theories as little bit. And I have some theories as little bit. And I have some theories as to why, but this is where we are. This to why, but this is where we are. This to why, but this is where we are. This is the reality. This was many, many is the reality. This was many, many is the reality. This was many, many weeks of retraining and trying not to weeks of retraining and trying not to weeks of retraining and trying not to overfit and trying to do this and that. overfit and trying to do this and that. overfit and trying to do this and that. This is where we ended This is where we ended This is where we ended up. And if there are any questions, jump up. And if there are any questions, jump up. And if there are any questions, jump in. Usually there's a ton. Yes, sir. And you want me to go back to this sir. And you want me to go back to this sir. And you want me to go back to this one? And then one more for this. That's one? And then one more for this. That's one? And then one more for this. That's team. And he just wanted me to jump team. And he just wanted me to jump team. And he just wanted me to jump slides for people remotely. There's a slides for people remotely. There's a slides for people remotely. There's a question up here. Did that Hey, I have two separate questions. One Hey, I have two separate questions. One Hey, I have two separate questions. One is h how would you explain that only 60% is h how would you explain that only 60% is h how would you explain that only 60% of the caves have exploration activity? of the caves have exploration activity? of the caves have exploration activity? That seems very low to very low to me. That seems very low to very low to me. That seems very low to very low to me. Yeah. And the other question is uh EPS Yeah. And the other question is uh EPS Yeah. And the other question is uh EPS v3 degrading. Isn't that sounds like v3 degrading. Isn't that sounds like v3 degrading. Isn't that sounds like overfeitting? Like maybe it was very overfeitting? Like maybe it was very overfeitting? Like maybe it was very trended to that day and just not trended to that day and just not trended to that day and just not performing well on new data. That is one performing well on new data. That is one performing well on new data. That is one of my theories. Yes, that I was of my theories. Yes, that I was of my theories. Yes, that I was overfitting a little bit, especially in overfitting a little bit, especially in overfitting a little bit, especially in that middle part. Um, and that was one that middle part. Um, and that was one that middle part. Um, and that was one of the things as I was doing V4, I was of the things as I was doing V4, I was of the things as I was doing V4, I was putting a lot of effort into the putting a lot of effort into the putting a lot of effort into the overfitting, trying to make sure I overfitting, trying to make sure I overfitting, trying to make sure I wasn't doing that. Um, which is why I'm wasn't doing that. Um, which is why I'm wasn't doing that. Um, which is why I'm sort of okay with it not surpassing. The sort of okay with it not surpassing. The sort of okay with it not surpassing. The other thing that I'll talk about is in other thing that I'll talk about is in other thing that I'll talk about is in V4 we added a lot more data and V3 and V4 we added a lot more data and V3 and V4 we added a lot more data and V3 and before was basically network activity. before was basically network activity. before was basically network activity. It was IDs, IPS, honeypotss. And then in It was IDs, IPS, honeypotss. And then in It was IDs, IPS, honeypotss. And then in V4, I started to get malware data. So I V4, I started to get malware data. So I V4, I started to get malware data. So I got ransomware malware um observations got ransomware malware um observations got ransomware malware um observations of that and analysis of that that would of that and analysis of that that would of that and analysis of that that would leverage CVEes in in their exploitation leverage CVEes in in their exploitation leverage CVEes in in their exploitation activity in the malware and so by activity in the malware and so by activity in the malware and so by changing that under underlying ground changing that under underlying ground changing that under underlying ground truth um I think that also might shift truth um I think that also might shift truth um I think that also might shift the performance of the model between the the performance of the model between the the performance of the model between the two. So and I'll talk about your other two. So and I'll talk about your other two. So and I'll talk about your other question as we get further into it. I've question as we get further into it. I've question as we get further into it. I've got some slides on got some slides on got some slides on that. Okay. Um this is one way to look that. Okay. Um this is one way to look that. Okay. Um this is one way to look at the differences. Um again V4 is a at the differences. Um again V4 is a at the differences. Um again V4 is a estimation. Um but we start to see the estimation. Um but we start to see the estimation. Um but we start to see the differences. Uh if we could actually see differences. Uh if we could actually see differences. Uh if we could actually see the lovely green colors. Uh this is V3. the lovely green colors. Uh this is V3. the lovely green colors. Uh this is V3. You can see like a lot of the things You can see like a lot of the things You can see like a lot of the things with exploitation activity are down with exploitation activity are down with exploitation activity are down here. But it really spans far down over here. But it really spans far down over here. But it really spans far down over here all the way to the end when we look here all the way to the end when we look here all the way to the end when we look at and if you look at the no evidence at and if you look at the no evidence at and if you look at the no evidence observed it goes all the way up to one. observed it goes all the way up to one. observed it goes all the way up to one. So there are some things scored really So there are some things scored really So there are some things scored really high in V3 where we don't see high in V3 where we don't see high in V3 where we don't see exploitation activity for it. And there exploitation activity for it. And there exploitation activity for it. And there are things scored really low that we do are things scored really low that we do are things scored really low that we do see exploitation for. When we get into see exploitation for. When we get into see exploitation for. When we get into V4, like I said, we're starting to see V4, like I said, we're starting to see V4, like I said, we're starting to see some separation. So in here, you can't some separation. So in here, you can't some separation. So in here, you can't see it, but there are some things that see it, but there are some things that see it, but there are some things that go to 100%. And down here, we do drop go to 100%. And down here, we do drop go to 100%. And down here, we do drop off a little bit. So there are things off a little bit. So there are things off a little bit. So there are things scored down here with very, very little scored down here with very, very little scored down here with very, very little exploitation activity. All right. So let's talk about activity. All right. So let's talk about activity. All right. So let's talk about what is actually new in what is actually new in what is actually new in V4. So just a technical thing on the V4. So just a technical thing on the V4. So just a technical thing on the back end. We completely redid the data back end. We completely redid the data back end. We completely redid the data collection. So we moved it from Scientia collection. So we moved it from Scientia collection. So we moved it from Scientia to my new company called Empirical to my new company called Empirical to my new company called Empirical Security and we rebuilt all of the data Security and we rebuilt all of the data Security and we rebuilt all of the data collection for it way more robust and we collection for it way more robust and we collection for it way more robust and we got funding and staffing and we're able got funding and staffing and we're able got funding and staffing and we're able to actually buy some commercial data now to actually buy some commercial data now to actually buy some commercial data now to throw in here. before all the to throw in here. before all the to throw in here. before all the commercial data was reliant on data commercial data was reliant on data commercial data was reliant on data partners donating data for this effort. partners donating data for this effort. partners donating data for this effort. And there were clearly some partners And there were clearly some partners And there were clearly some partners that did not want to donate their data. that did not want to donate their data. that did not want to donate their data. So now we're buying some data to throw So now we're buying some data to throw So now we're buying some data to throw in there. Um, and I'm going to talk in there. Um, and I'm going to talk in there. Um, and I'm going to talk about new new data sources on the next about new new data sources on the next about new new data sources on the next slide. Like I said, we added malware. slide. Like I said, we added malware. slide. Like I said, we added malware. Um, and there are a few dead sources in Um, and there are a few dead sources in Um, and there are a few dead sources in there and now we're about two 2,500 there and now we're about two 2,500 there and now we're about two 2,500 features. And I can tell you not all of features. And I can tell you not all of features. And I can tell you not all of those matter. Um, and there's definitely those matter. Um, and there's definitely those matter. Um, and there's definitely some pruning that could happen, but some pruning that could happen, but some pruning that could happen, but we're going to talk about variable we're going to talk about variable we're going to talk about variable importance in a bit here. All right, the importance in a bit here. All right, the importance in a bit here. All right, the new data, um, there's some interesting new data, um, there's some interesting new data, um, there's some interesting data. So, I added in things and the the data. So, I added in things and the the data. So, I added in things and the the categories here I put on it. This the categories here I put on it. This the categories here I put on it. This the model has no idea what category these model has no idea what category these model has no idea what category these features are in, but I mean, we we start features are in, but I mean, we we start features are in, but I mean, we we start with an age that's always been in there. with an age that's always been in there. with an age that's always been in there. You know, do do newer things get You know, do do newer things get You know, do do newer things get exploited faster more so than older ones exploited faster more so than older ones exploited faster more so than older ones or vice versa? And I've got a slide on or vice versa? And I've got a slide on or vice versa? And I've got a slide on that. Um some new sites that I added. I that. Um some new sites that I added. I that. Um some new sites that I added. I added Showdan. So if Shdan identifies um added Showdan. So if Shdan identifies um added Showdan. So if Shdan identifies um vulnerabilities you can go search for a vulnerabilities you can go search for a vulnerabilities you can go search for a CVE and there I think there's about a CVE and there I think there's about a CVE and there I think there's about a thousand that Showdan actually scans the thousand that Showdan actually scans the thousand that Showdan actually scans the internet for and you'll see and we we internet for and you'll see and we we internet for and you'll see and we we put that variable in there if Showdan is put that variable in there if Showdan is put that variable in there if Showdan is scanning for it and how many it's scanning for it and how many it's scanning for it and how many it's finding. Um activity from hacker one finding. Um activity from hacker one finding. Um activity from hacker one where bug bounty folks are identifying where bug bounty folks are identifying where bug bounty folks are identifying CVS in the wild. I threw that in. I CVS in the wild. I threw that in. I CVS in the wild. I threw that in. I don't think it's a huge variable. We'll don't think it's a huge variable. We'll don't think it's a huge variable. We'll see if it comes up later. Um but it's a see if it comes up later. Um but it's a see if it comes up later. Um but it's a it certainly contributes. Um I added it certainly contributes. Um I added it certainly contributes. Um I added about 13 features where so the at the about 13 features where so the at the about 13 features where so the at the bottom I've got domain where I talk bottom I've got domain where I talk bottom I've got domain where I talk about if are CVE mentioned on different about if are CVE mentioned on different about if are CVE mentioned on different domains have a huge data source of domains have a huge data source of domains have a huge data source of scanning uh websites articles blogs scanning uh websites articles blogs scanning uh websites articles blogs media posts etc mentioning CVEes and media posts etc mentioning CVEes and media posts etc mentioning CVEes and then from that I developed 13 features then from that I developed 13 features then from that I developed 13 features um they're engineered features basically um they're engineered features basically um they're engineered features basically around timing like how many were were around timing like how many were were around timing like how many were were referenced in the last 30 days were they referenced in the last 30 days were they referenced in the last 30 days were they referenced here things like that and referenced here things like that and referenced here things like that and I've got about 13 that um look had I've got about 13 that um look had I've got about 13 that um look had associations with malware, thread associations with malware, thread associations with malware, thread actors, things like that. Um, and then actors, things like that. Um, and then actors, things like that. Um, and then the other change was in the other change was in the other change was in C.WE. I used to just throw the CW in C.WE. I used to just throw the CW in C.WE. I used to just throw the CW in there, and anybody who's worked with CWE there, and anybody who's worked with CWE there, and anybody who's worked with CWE knows that there's different layers of knows that there's different layers of knows that there's different layers of abstraction, and so I think that was abstraction, and so I think that was abstraction, and so I think that was confusing the previous model. So I roll confusing the previous model. So I roll confusing the previous model. So I roll all of them up into 22 categories uh all of them up into 22 categories uh all of them up into 22 categories uh under category 1400, which is means under category 1400, which is means under category 1400, which is means every CWE can roll up to one of the 22 every CWE can roll up to one of the 22 every CWE can roll up to one of the 22 categories. um which was a new discovery categories. um which was a new discovery categories. um which was a new discovery that I made in the C.WE stuff. Um and that I made in the C.WE stuff. Um and that I made in the C.WE stuff. Um and then lastly, CVSS because before we were then lastly, CVSS because before we were then lastly, CVSS because before we were just doing 3.1 and uh Ben Edwards made a just doing 3.1 and uh Ben Edwards made a just doing 3.1 and uh Ben Edwards made a great model that took all the old ones great model that took all the old ones great model that took all the old ones and put them into 3.1 and it's just the and put them into 3.1 and it's just the and put them into 3.1 and it's just the vectors, but in this one I just because vectors, but in this one I just because vectors, but in this one I just because we had 4.0 coming out and there are some we had 4.0 coming out and there are some we had 4.0 coming out and there are some with 4.0, some not. And so I just took with 4.0, some not. And so I just took with 4.0, some not. And so I just took all of the vectors and sort of smooshed all of the vectors and sort of smooshed all of the vectors and sort of smooshed them into variables into features. So we them into variables into features. So we them into variables into features. So we got 65 different CVSs features depending got 65 different CVSs features depending got 65 different CVSs features depending on the the vector and the and the value on the the vector and the and the value on the the vector and the and the value in in in there. Okay, I want to talk about there. Okay, I want to talk about there. Okay, I want to talk about exploitation activity because this is exploitation activity because this is exploitation activity because this is one of the key things in the model. It's one of the key things in the model. It's one of the key things in the model. It's built on exploitation activity. So I built on exploitation activity. So I built on exploitation activity. So I want to try a game here and I want want to try a game here and I want want to try a game here and I want people to think of what they think about people to think of what they think about people to think of what they think about when I make these statements about our when I make these statements about our when I make these statements about our exploitation activity that we're exploitation activity that we're exploitation activity that we're covering. Out of all the published covering. Out of all the published covering. Out of all the published vulnerabilities, only about 6% have vulnerabilities, only about 6% have vulnerabilities, only about 6% have known exploitation activity. known exploitation activity. known exploitation activity. 94% of published uh CVEEs do not have 94% of published uh CVEEs do not have 94% of published uh CVEEs do not have any known exploitation any known exploitation any known exploitation activity. Think about that. Now, think activity. Think about that. Now, think activity. Think about that. Now, think about this about this about this one. one. one. 16,300 published vulnerabilities have 16,300 published vulnerabilities have 16,300 published vulnerabilities have known exploitation activity, which is 13 known exploitation activity, which is 13 known exploitation activity, which is 13 times what is currently on the times what is currently on the times what is currently on the sysv. Now, if you are human, you sysv. Now, if you are human, you sysv. Now, if you are human, you probably had these thoughts. I'm just probably had these thoughts. I'm just probably had these thoughts. I'm just going to try and guess. When I talked going to try and guess. When I talked going to try and guess. When I talked about this one, the thought was, "What about this one, the thought was, "What about this one, the thought was, "What are you missing? What you've got? 94% are you missing? What you've got? 94% are you missing? What you've got? 94% that you're missing. What are you that you're missing. What are you that you're missing. What are you missing?" Right? And did people have missing?" Right? And did people have missing?" Right? And did people have that thought? Yes, sir. Is it a CVE? You know, publish sir. Is it a CVE? You know, publish sir. Is it a CVE? You know, publish vulnerability. Is it CVE based vulnerability. Is it CVE based vulnerability. Is it CVE based vulnerability or something else? It is vulnerability or something else? It is vulnerability or something else? It is all CVEes. Okay. Yes. Um, and that is all CVEes. Okay. Yes. Um, and that is all CVEes. Okay. Yes. Um, and that is very much on purpose. Um, there's so very much on purpose. Um, there's so very much on purpose. Um, there's so many reasons to go into that, but yes, many reasons to go into that, but yes, many reasons to go into that, but yes, it's all published CVS. When I say it's all published CVS. When I say it's all published CVS. When I say published vulnerability, I mean published vulnerability, I mean published vulnerability, I mean published on the CVE list with a CV ID. published on the CVE list with a CV ID. published on the CVE list with a CV ID. Um, and so the question here is what are Um, and so the question here is what are Um, and so the question here is what are we missing? Right? Clearly only 6%, we missing? Right? Clearly only 6%, we missing? Right? Clearly only 6%, there are so many other things out there are so many other things out there are so many other things out there. What are we missing? And then there. What are we missing? And then there. What are we missing? And then when I frame it in terms of what we know when I frame it in terms of what we know when I frame it in terms of what we know now is exploited as 13 times that. The now is exploited as 13 times that. The now is exploited as 13 times that. The obvious question is, do you have false obvious question is, do you have false obvious question is, do you have false positive? Are you checking for that? Why positive? Are you checking for that? Why positive? Are you checking for that? Why do you have so many more than what we do you have so many more than what we do you have so many more than what we know about? And the the cool thing about know about? And the the cool thing about know about? And the the cool thing about both these questions is that they're both these questions is that they're both these questions is that they're both accurate and they're both problems both accurate and they're both problems both accurate and they're both problems simultaneously. We are absolutely simultaneously. We are absolutely simultaneously. We are absolutely missing things. I can tell you that for missing things. I can tell you that for missing things. I can tell you that for sure and I'll get into that. And then sure and I'll get into that. And then sure and I'll get into that. And then the the false positives. Yes, there are the the false positives. Yes, there are the the false positives. Yes, there are false positives in here. I am trusting false positives in here. I am trusting false positives in here. I am trusting our data sources. If if there's a vendor our data sources. If if there's a vendor our data sources. If if there's a vendor who says I saw exploitation activity for who says I saw exploitation activity for who says I saw exploitation activity for this, I do not go and fact check every this, I do not go and fact check every this, I do not go and fact check every single one. it's nearly impossible for single one. it's nearly impossible for single one. it's nearly impossible for the data I'm given. Um I can almost the data I'm given. Um I can almost the data I'm given. Um I can almost guarantee they're in there. I do do some guarantee they're in there. I do do some guarantee they're in there. I do do some things where um like one of the sources things where um like one of the sources things where um like one of the sources will because they're an IDS vendor, they will because they're an IDS vendor, they will because they're an IDS vendor, they focus on blocking and there's one like focus on blocking and there's one like focus on blocking and there's one like if there's one signature or collection if there's one signature or collection if there's one signature or collection of signatures and it blocks 18 different of signatures and it blocks 18 different of signatures and it blocks 18 different vulnerabilities because of the way it's vulnerabilities because of the way it's vulnerabilities because of the way it's structured. I get associated with 18 structured. I get associated with 18 structured. I get associated with 18 different CVEes. And so I try to factor different CVEes. And so I try to factor different CVEes. And so I try to factor that in and take those out. Um because that in and take those out. Um because that in and take those out. Um because you can't just say all 18 are exploited you can't just say all 18 are exploited you can't just say all 18 are exploited because that's not accurate. Um and so because that's not accurate. Um and so because that's not accurate. Um and so there's a challenge with that some of there's a challenge with that some of there's a challenge with that some of those false positive but we're trying to those false positive but we're trying to those false positive but we're trying to address that and trying to filter those address that and trying to filter those address that and trying to filter those out and not misassociate with that. out and not misassociate with that. out and not misassociate with that. So can I I have a question here? Yes. Um So can I I have a question here? Yes. Um So can I I have a question here? Yes. Um but here in this case we have to be but here in this case we have to be but here in this case we have to be aware of what you said which at the aware of what you said which at the aware of what you said which at the beginning which is this is attempted beginning which is this is attempted beginning which is this is attempted exploitation. It's not necessarily exploitation. It's not necessarily exploitation. It's not necessarily successful. Correct. So how does this successful. Correct. So how does this successful. Correct. So how does this difference then affect what we know of difference then affect what we know of difference then affect what we know of these results these results these results in what way? Say more. uh like for in what way? Say more. uh like for in what way? Say more. uh like for example do do we check for false example do do we check for false example do do we check for false positives but here in this case we don't positives but here in this case we don't positives but here in this case we don't even know if the exploitation like took even know if the exploitation like took even know if the exploitation like took place how does this affect what we place how does this affect what we place how does this affect what we consider a false positive here like if I consider a false positive here like if I consider a false positive here like if I send the payload so let me ask you a send the payload so let me ask you a send the payload so let me ask you a different question let's say you have no different question let's say you have no different question let's say you have no math around you you've got no models you math around you you've got no models you math around you you've got no models you see a blog from vendor X and they say see a blog from vendor X and they say see a blog from vendor X and they say this is this is this is exploited is that a false positive I'd exploited is that a false positive I'd exploited is that a false positive I'd have to check we have no idea right have to check we have no idea right have to check we have no idea right you'd have to go into every single one. you'd have to go into every single one. you'd have to go into every single one. This is not like false positives and This is not like false positives and This is not like false positives and false negatives are not unique to this false negatives are not unique to this false negatives are not unique to this model. Everybody in this industry model. Everybody in this industry model. Everybody in this industry struggles with this. This is not this is struggles with this. This is not this is struggles with this. This is not this is not an EPSS problem. This is our data not an EPSS problem. This is our data not an EPSS problem. This is our data collection problem, right? So yes, I collection problem, right? So yes, I collection problem, right? So yes, I mean absolutely it it is just mean absolutely it it is just mean absolutely it it is just exploitation activity and this very much exploitation activity and this very much exploitation activity and this very much could be me scanning the internet trying could be me scanning the internet trying could be me scanning the internet trying to see how much heart bleed is still out to see how much heart bleed is still out to see how much heart bleed is still out there, right? That definitely comes up. there, right? That definitely comes up. there, right? That definitely comes up. Uh one additional question if I may like Uh one additional question if I may like Uh one additional question if I may like for example if you were able magically for example if you were able magically for example if you were able magically let's say you had a box where you could let's say you had a box where you could let's say you had a box where you could ask hey is any of these ever been ask hey is any of these ever been ask hey is any of these ever been successful and you got back something successful and you got back something successful and you got back something that every single attempt to exploit the that every single attempt to exploit the that every single attempt to exploit the CVE has been unsuccessful right what CVE has been unsuccessful right what CVE has been unsuccessful right what does that tell us in that case so if does that tell us in that case so if does that tell us in that case so if you're a defender and you know that this you're a defender and you know that this you're a defender and you know that this vulnerability is in your network and vulnerability is in your network and vulnerability is in your network and someone says this has been exploited someone says this has been exploited someone says this has been exploited every day for the last 13 every day for the last 13 every day for the last 13 years do you still want to patch it it's years do you still want to patch it it's years do you still want to patch it it's never been successful that we know of do never been successful that we know of do never been successful that we know of do you still want to patch catch it. Yes, you still want to patch catch it. Yes, you still want to patch catch it. Yes, of course. And so, yeah, I mean, it's of course. And so, yeah, I mean, it's of course. And so, yeah, I mean, it's information that we didn't have before information that we didn't have before information that we didn't have before and that's what we're going after, and that's what we're going after, and that's what we're going after, right? Yeah. Past results are not right? Yeah. Past results are not right? Yeah. Past results are not guaranteed that in the future they're guaranteed that in the future they're guaranteed that in the future they're not going to figure out finally how to not going to figure out finally how to not going to figure out finally how to exploit it. Yeah. So, even like even if exploit it. Yeah. So, even like even if exploit it. Yeah. So, even like even if you don't know that they're successful, you don't know that they're successful, you don't know that they're successful, it's still information you know that it's still information you know that it's still information you know that exploitation activity is occurring and exploitation activity is occurring and exploitation activity is occurring and it might you might be the first it might you might be the first it might you might be the first successful case, right? So, yes, sir. successful case, right? So, yes, sir. successful case, right? So, yes, sir. Um, but you at least have the ceasev. Um, but you at least have the ceasev. Um, but you at least have the ceasev. you do have positive like a baseline to you do have positive like a baseline to you do have positive like a baseline to check against because they do validate check against because they do validate check against because they do validate because if it's on the sizv let's say it because if it's on the sizv let's say it because if it's on the sizv let's say it was added a year and a half ago I want was added a year and a half ago I want was added a year and a half ago I want to know if it's going to be exploited uh to know if it's going to be exploited uh to know if it's going to be exploited uh April 15th through the next 30 days in April 15th through the next 30 days in April 15th through the next 30 days in my patch cycle is it yeah so the the the my patch cycle is it yeah so the the the my patch cycle is it yeah so the the the question in my head is is do you use the question in my head is is do you use the question in my head is is do you use the kev is kind of like okay these I know kev is kind of like okay these I know kev is kind of like okay these I know and then compare against all the ones and then compare against all the ones and then compare against all the ones that don't end up on the I do that in my that don't end up on the I do that in my that don't end up on the I do that in my slide deck. Okay. Um but no, I do what I slide deck. Okay. Um but no, I do what I slide deck. Okay. Um but no, I do what I do for the Kev is I have it on the other do for the Kev is I have it on the other do for the Kev is I have it on the other side. To me, it's not exploitation side. To me, it's not exploitation side. To me, it's not exploitation activity, but if it's added to the KV activity, but if it's added to the KV activity, but if it's added to the KV and my model says, "All right, it was and my model says, "All right, it was and my model says, "All right, it was added to the KEV. Do I think it's going added to the KEV. Do I think it's going added to the KEV. Do I think it's going to be exploited in the next 30 days? to be exploited in the next 30 days? to be exploited in the next 30 days? Given all the other things we've seen on Given all the other things we've seen on Given all the other things we've seen on the KEV, do I think it's going to be the KEV, do I think it's going to be the KEV, do I think it's going to be exploited in the next 30 days?" And so exploited in the next 30 days?" And so exploited in the next 30 days?" And so that's how it's used um in here. So, that's how it's used um in here. So, that's how it's used um in here. So, thanks. Yep. thanks. Yep. thanks. Yep. All right. So, we do have a problem with All right. So, we do have a problem with All right. So, we do have a problem with both of these. Um, not unique to EPSS, both of these. Um, not unique to EPSS, both of these. Um, not unique to EPSS, purely a challenge with the data. But I purely a challenge with the data. But I purely a challenge with the data. But I want to go back to this. The way that want to go back to this. The way that want to go back to this. The way that this is plotted is it's called a density this is plotted is it's called a density this is plotted is it's called a density plot. And the area under each of these plot. And the area under each of these plot. And the area under each of these bubbles is the same. But we just said bubbles is the same. But we just said bubbles is the same. But we just said that only 6% is exploited. So, I want to that only 6% is exploited. So, I want to that only 6% is exploited. So, I want to show you the real problem that we're show you the real problem that we're show you the real problem that we're dealing with. Any scoring system, not dealing with. Any scoring system, not dealing with. Any scoring system, not EPSS, any scoring system. This is the EPSS, any scoring system. This is the EPSS, any scoring system. This is the problem. problem. problem. We've got all of these We've got all of these We've got all of these vulnerabilities and we need to pick out vulnerabilities and we need to pick out vulnerabilities and we need to pick out these. This is the challenge. I created these. This is the challenge. I created these. This is the challenge. I created this platin. I was like, "Wow, this is this platin. I was like, "Wow, this is this platin. I was like, "Wow, this is crazy, right?" Um, and so this is this crazy, right?" Um, and so this is this crazy, right?" Um, and so this is this is the actual problem we're trying to is the actual problem we're trying to is the actual problem we're trying to do. And so what what people can do, you do. And so what what people can do, you do. And so what what people can do, you can grab this and say, "Hey, I found can grab this and say, "Hey, I found can grab this and say, "Hey, I found this CVE, this one right here, right? this CVE, this one right here, right? this CVE, this one right here, right? It's rated really low, and I found a It's rated really low, and I found a It's rated really low, and I found a blog that says it's it's exploited. They blog that says it's it's exploited. They blog that says it's it's exploited. They are clearly wrong. This is a terrible are clearly wrong. This is a terrible are clearly wrong. This is a terrible approach. Why are people using APSS? approach. Why are people using APSS? approach. Why are people using APSS? Right? This is a terrible way to talk Right? This is a terrible way to talk Right? This is a terrible way to talk about a scoring model. Why don't you about a scoring model. Why don't you about a scoring model. Why don't you come up with a system, publish your come up with a system, publish your come up with a system, publish your numbers, and we can compare it to this. numbers, and we can compare it to this. numbers, and we can compare it to this. Then we can talk about how you can only Then we can talk about how you can only Then we can talk about how you can only talk about how well something is doing talk about how well something is doing talk about how well something is doing compared to another method. If you say compared to another method. If you say compared to another method. If you say don't use this, what do people do? What don't use this, what do people do? What don't use this, what do people do? What if you say don't use ZPSS? It's if you say don't use ZPSS? It's if you say don't use ZPSS? It's terrible. What do people do then? They terrible. What do people do then? They terrible. What do people do then? They maybe have analysts in a room. They maybe have analysts in a room. They maybe have analysts in a room. They leverage CVS TVs. We saw that on the leverage CVS TVs. We saw that on the leverage CVS TVs. We saw that on the other slide. You know, it's hard to say other slide. You know, it's hard to say other slide. You know, it's hard to say don't use this and then people fall back don't use this and then people fall back don't use this and then people fall back to crystal balls or whatever it is, to crystal balls or whatever it is, to crystal balls or whatever it is, right? So, that's a right? So, that's a right? So, that's a challenge. All right, let's talk about challenge. All right, let's talk about challenge. All right, let's talk about Sizv because this is actually this was Sizv because this is actually this was Sizv because this is actually this was illuminating to me and I I talked about illuminating to me and I I talked about illuminating to me and I I talked about Suzikv here last year and uh Sandy Suzikv here last year and uh Sandy Suzikv here last year and uh Sandy Redeski, absolutely amazing person. Uh Redeski, absolutely amazing person. Uh Redeski, absolutely amazing person. Uh hi Sandy if you're watching. Um she came hi Sandy if you're watching. Um she came hi Sandy if you're watching. Um she came up to me afterwards and had some very up to me afterwards and had some very up to me afterwards and had some very stern words for me about how I treated stern words for me about how I treated stern words for me about how I treated this as a Kev. Um which I was very this as a Kev. Um which I was very this as a Kev. Um which I was very appreciative of and it made me really appreciative of and it made me really appreciative of and it made me really think like what if this is this is think like what if this is this is think like what if this is this is everything I have exploitation activity everything I have exploitation activity everything I have exploitation activity for this is sysv and I'm missing 408 in for this is sysv and I'm missing 408 in for this is sysv and I'm missing 408 in my data and clearly sysv with their my data and clearly sysv with their my data and clearly sysv with their collection is not seeing everything I'm collection is not seeing everything I'm collection is not seeing everything I'm seeing and or is not meeting their seeing and or is not meeting their seeing and or is not meeting their criteria whatever it is. What if both of criteria whatever it is. What if both of criteria whatever it is. What if both of these are these are these are accurate? Remember, and I think this is accurate? Remember, and I think this is accurate? Remember, and I think this is absolutely true. I think both of these absolutely true. I think both of these absolutely true. I think both of these are are are accurate in my data. I'm missing this accurate in my data. I'm missing this accurate in my data. I'm missing this 408. I can tell you there's a lot more 408. I can tell you there's a lot more 408. I can tell you there's a lot more than 408 that we're missing. I am 100% than 408 that we're missing. I am 100% than 408 that we're missing. I am 100% sure of sure of sure of that. And so I think both of these are that. And so I think both of these are that. And so I think both of these are accurate. But again, we can't just say accurate. But again, we can't just say accurate. But again, we can't just say this is wrong, don't use it. We want to this is wrong, don't use it. We want to this is wrong, don't use it. We want to compare. So what I did is I created that compare. So what I did is I created that compare. So what I did is I created that same coverage and efficiency plot and I same coverage and efficiency plot and I same coverage and efficiency plot and I said what if sysv was our ground truth? said what if sysv was our ground truth? said what if sysv was our ground truth? How do things actually How do things actually How do things actually perform? And so I first plotted CVS. It perform? And so I first plotted CVS. It perform? And so I first plotted CVS. It might be hard to see. It's this line might be hard to see. It's this line might be hard to see. It's this line right here. Um and I think so like sisv right here. Um and I think so like sisv right here. Um and I think so like sisv has about half a percent of has about half a percent of has about half a percent of vulnerabilities. I think this might be vulnerabilities. I think this might be vulnerabilities. I think this might be like on the high end this might be worse like on the high end this might be worse like on the high end this might be worse than random chance. like you shouldn't than random chance. like you shouldn't than random chance. like you shouldn't take CVSS 10. If you're just going to do take CVSS 10. If you're just going to do take CVSS 10. If you're just going to do 10, you might be better off rolling the 10, you might be better off rolling the 10, you might be better off rolling the dice. You might get better efficiency. dice. You might get better efficiency. dice. You might get better efficiency. Um, but as you get here, there might be Um, but as you get here, there might be Um, but as you get here, there might be a little benefit, but I mean largely a little benefit, but I mean largely a little benefit, but I mean largely this is this is what we have to beat, this is this is what we have to beat, this is this is what we have to beat, right? And you can see when I looked at right? And you can see when I looked at right? And you can see when I looked at EPSS up at the top, it drops down quick. EPSS up at the top, it drops down quick. EPSS up at the top, it drops down quick. And so there's a lot of things that EPSS And so there's a lot of things that EPSS And so there's a lot of things that EPSS is rating high that are not on this as a is rating high that are not on this as a is rating high that are not on this as a Kev. And because we come down like this Kev. And because we come down like this Kev. And because we come down like this and flatten out, there's things on the and flatten out, there's things on the and flatten out, there's things on the sizes that are rated low, which I think sizes that are rated low, which I think sizes that are rated low, which I think is interesting. Like why is this? What is interesting. Like why is this? What is interesting. Like why is this? What can we do in V5 to try and remedy this? can we do in V5 to try and remedy this? can we do in V5 to try and remedy this? How do we factor that stuff in? And this How do we factor that stuff in? And this How do we factor that stuff in? And this is part of the challenge, I think, and is part of the challenge, I think, and is part of the challenge, I think, and part of the the joy that we get to do part of the the joy that we get to do part of the the joy that we get to do this with this kind of this with this kind of this with this kind of challenge. All right, I want to talk challenge. All right, I want to talk challenge. All right, I want to talk real quickly about how the model is real quickly about how the model is real quickly about how the model is created. created. created. Um I've tried various ways to try and Um I've tried various ways to try and Um I've tried various ways to try and represent how this model works and this represent how this model works and this represent how this model works and this I think might be the one of the better I think might be the one of the better I think might be the one of the better ways. Um so basically um first this is a ways. Um so basically um first this is a ways. Um so basically um first this is a look at the data. So we've got one look at the data. So we've got one look at the data. So we've got one column over here about exploitation column over here about exploitation column over here about exploitation activity and each row is one CVE on one activity and each row is one CVE on one activity and each row is one CVE on one day and the state of information. All day and the state of information. All day and the state of information. All these things are the variables that I'm these things are the variables that I'm these things are the variables that I'm looking at and it goes over for 2500 looking at and it goes over for 2500 looking at and it goes over for 2500 rows. Um and it becomes very sparse. rows. Um and it becomes very sparse. rows. Um and it becomes very sparse. Most of these things are not set for Most of these things are not set for Most of these things are not set for most most most vulnerabilities. Um and so then it goes vulnerabilities. Um and so then it goes vulnerabilities. Um and so then it goes down for every CVE for every day in the down for every CVE for every day in the down for every CVE for every day in the training data set. And there are 82 training data set. And there are 82 training data set. And there are 82 billion CVE plus days in the training billion CVE plus days in the training billion CVE plus days in the training data set goes down 82 billion rows. And data set goes down 82 billion rows. And data set goes down 82 billion rows. And you can see over here in this little you can see over here in this little you can see over here in this little sample I grabbed there were two days sample I grabbed there were two days sample I grabbed there were two days with exploitation activity. and they're with exploitation activity. and they're with exploitation activity. and they're they're slightly grayed because I do they're slightly grayed because I do they're slightly grayed because I do some grouping and and waiting and things some grouping and and waiting and things some grouping and and waiting and things like that. And so like that top one like that. And so like that top one like that. And so like that top one because it's a little more gray out of because it's a little more gray out of because it's a little more gray out of probably a 20-day window, maybe 11 days probably a 20-day window, maybe 11 days probably a 20-day window, maybe 11 days out of the 20 actually had exploitation out of the 20 actually had exploitation out of the 20 actually had exploitation activity. And so this is what the activity. And so this is what the activity. And so this is what the training looks like. We get all of these training looks like. We get all of these training looks like. We get all of these columns and rows and uh we get the uh columns and rows and uh we get the uh columns and rows and uh we get the uh activity of exploitation and we're activity of exploitation and we're activity of exploitation and we're trying to gather as much information on trying to gather as much information on trying to gather as much information on the right to help inform us about that the right to help inform us about that the right to help inform us about that exploitation exploitation exploitation activity. Any questions on this be activity. Any questions on this be activity. Any questions on this be really surprised. All right, cool. really surprised. All right, cool. really surprised. All right, cool. All right, I want to talk about All right, I want to talk about All right, I want to talk about probability because this this may I probability because this this may I probability because this this may I don't want to say it was a bad decision don't want to say it was a bad decision don't want to say it was a bad decision to release probability. Uh I do think to release probability. Uh I do think to release probability. Uh I do think that there's a lot of benefit benefits that there's a lot of benefit benefits that there's a lot of benefit benefits to it but there's there's some to it but there's there's some to it but there's there's some challenges to it as well. challenges to it as well. challenges to it as well. Um so this is again the output and I Um so this is again the output and I Um so this is again the output and I tried to highlight this in a yellow and tried to highlight this in a yellow and tried to highlight this in a yellow and probability is yellow but probability is probability is yellow but probability is probability is yellow but probability is a ratio number you know have like a ratio number you know have like a ratio number you know have like ordinal nominal things like that um as a ordinal nominal things like that um as a ordinal nominal things like that um as a ratio number you can use it and formulas ratio number you can use it and formulas ratio number you can use it and formulas and math do combinations um Steven and math do combinations um Steven and math do combinations um Steven talked about uh EPSS grouping and how he talked about uh EPSS grouping and how he talked about uh EPSS grouping and how he looks on an asset and combine the looks on an asset and combine the looks on an asset and combine the probability for all the vulnerabilities probability for all the vulnerabilities probability for all the vulnerabilities on an asset and you can do that because on an asset and you can do that because on an asset and you can do that because it's probability it's probability it's probability And I'll talk about how it's calibrated And I'll talk about how it's calibrated And I'll talk about how it's calibrated I think in a later slide. But I think in a later slide. But I think in a later slide. But probability is really unintuitive. probability is really unintuitive. probability is really unintuitive. There's a great quote from a professor There's a great quote from a professor There's a great quote from a professor of risk studies at I think at Cambridge of risk studies at I think at Cambridge of risk studies at I think at Cambridge where he said you know I I was really where he said you know I I was really where he said you know I I was really surprised. I really wanted to understand surprised. I really wanted to understand surprised. I really wanted to understand why probability was so unintuitive and why probability was so unintuitive and why probability was so unintuitive and difficult for people. and he said, difficult for people. and he said, difficult for people. and he said, "After years of studying, I figured out "After years of studying, I figured out "After years of studying, I figured out it's because probability is unintuitive it's because probability is unintuitive it's because probability is unintuitive and and and difficult." And so people get really difficult." And so people get really difficult." And so people get really wrapped around probability and trying to wrapped around probability and trying to wrapped around probability and trying to trying to understand and put it into trying to understand and put it into trying to understand and put it into practice. And this is a plot of all the practice. And this is a plot of all the practice. And this is a plot of all the EPSS scores on a linear EPSS scores on a linear EPSS scores on a linear scale. And I try to tell people not to scale. And I try to tell people not to scale. And I try to tell people not to do this, but this is what it looks like. do this, but this is what it looks like. do this, but this is what it looks like. If you just put it on a straight linear If you just put it on a straight linear If you just put it on a straight linear scale, you get this big thing on the scale, you get this big thing on the scale, you get this big thing on the left, and that's all you see. There's left, and that's all you see. There's left, and that's all you see. There's data out here, but you can't see it. And if we split out the ones with no it. And if we split out the ones with no it. And if we split out the ones with no activity from the exploitation activity, activity from the exploitation activity, activity from the exploitation activity, now you can see the exploitation now you can see the exploitation now you can see the exploitation activity has some shape to it. But it activity has some shape to it. But it activity has some shape to it. But it still seems like, man, this low stuff is still seems like, man, this low stuff is still seems like, man, this low stuff is really right in line with this low really right in line with this low really right in line with this low stuff. Like, that doesn't look good. And stuff. Like, that doesn't look good. And stuff. Like, that doesn't look good. And again this is on a linear scale but if again this is on a linear scale but if again this is on a linear scale but if we just change it to a log view because we just change it to a log view because we just change it to a log view because this probability is growing this probability is growing this probability is growing exponentially this is the actual exponentially this is the actual exponentially this is the actual separation we get on a log scale. Now separation we get on a log scale. Now separation we get on a log scale. Now you can see the information in that data you can see the information in that data you can see the information in that data is actually pretty well se is actually pretty well se is actually pretty well se separated. You can see that the mound separated. You can see that the mound separated. You can see that the mound over here is pushed to the right and the over here is pushed to the right and the over here is pushed to the right and the mound over here is pushed to the left. mound over here is pushed to the left. mound over here is pushed to the left. So when you look at this data accurately So when you look at this data accurately So when you look at this data accurately when you represent it accurately uh you when you represent it accurately uh you when you represent it accurately uh you can see the separation. If you want to can see the separation. If you want to can see the separation. If you want to point out how bad EPSS is, then do point out how bad EPSS is, then do point out how bad EPSS is, then do something like this. Like you could talk something like this. Like you could talk something like this. Like you could talk about it like this. So, um, if you about it like this. So, um, if you about it like this. So, um, if you wanna, what's that book? How to how to wanna, what's that book? How to how to wanna, what's that book? How to how to lie with statistics. A lot of it was on lie with statistics. A lot of it was on lie with statistics. A lot of it was on visualization. All right. So, let's talk visualization. All right. So, let's talk visualization. All right. So, let's talk about calibration. Um, because we're about calibration. Um, because we're about calibration. Um, because we're talking about a probability. When we say talking about a probability. When we say talking about a probability. When we say a 1% chance, we mean that 1% of those a 1% chance, we mean that 1% of those a 1% chance, we mean that 1% of those are probably going to be exploited. And are probably going to be exploited. And are probably going to be exploited. And so, this is a calibration plot. when you so, this is a calibration plot. when you so, this is a calibration plot. when you look at all of the things in a range look at all of the things in a range look at all of the things in a range across that score and you say like at across that score and you say like at across that score and you say like at 10% we expect about 10% of everything 10% we expect about 10% of everything 10% we expect about 10% of everything rated around there to be exploited and rated around there to be exploited and rated around there to be exploited and so I picked out this one little sliver so I picked out this one little sliver so I picked out this one little sliver right here and there were 2100 CVEes in right here and there were 2100 CVEes in right here and there were 2100 CVEes in that sliver and out of that that sliver and out of that that sliver and out of that 2100 28 of them had exploitation 2100 28 of them had exploitation 2100 28 of them had exploitation activity just a little bit over 1% activity just a little bit over 1% activity just a little bit over 1% chance and so this is a way that we can chance and so this is a way that we can chance and so this is a way that we can talk about calibration. So if somebody talk about calibration. So if somebody talk about calibration. So if somebody says, "Hey, this is rated at 0.1% and it says, "Hey, this is rated at 0.1% and it says, "Hey, this is rated at 0.1% and it was exploited, you idiot." You know, was exploited, you idiot." You know, was exploited, you idiot." You know, um.1% of those should be exploited if um.1% of those should be exploited if um.1% of those should be exploited if our probability is our probability is our probability is accurate. And this is how you evaluate accurate. And this is how you evaluate accurate. And this is how you evaluate probability output. You don't take that probability output. You don't take that probability output. You don't take that 0.1% and say 0.1% and say 0.1% and say wrong. So let's talk about percentile wrong. So let's talk about percentile wrong. So let's talk about percentile because this also gets interesting. because this also gets interesting. because this also gets interesting. Um, so the percentile here is basically Um, so the percentile here is basically Um, so the percentile here is basically a ranking. It's an ordinal number. It is a ranking. It's an ordinal number. It is a ranking. It's an ordinal number. It is putting all of those vulnerabilities in putting all of those vulnerabilities in putting all of those vulnerabilities in order and it is saying basically what order and it is saying basically what order and it is saying basically what percent of all published CVEes are at or percent of all published CVEes are at or percent of all published CVEes are at or below this score. So if you look at that below this score. So if you look at that below this score. So if you look at that first one, uh, the CV 2022 41047, no first one, uh, the CV 2022 41047, no first one, uh, the CV 2022 41047, no idea what it is. It's rated at idea what it is. It's rated at idea what it is. It's rated at 2.1%. 82% of all the other CVEs are 2.1%. 82% of all the other CVEs are 2.1%. 82% of all the other CVEs are rated at or below 2.1%. You cannot combine these. Uh this is You cannot combine these. Uh this is You cannot combine these. Uh this is purely an ordinal number. Um and it just purely an ordinal number. Um and it just purely an ordinal number. Um and it just sort of gives you a sense of where it is sort of gives you a sense of where it is sort of gives you a sense of where it is in the grand scheme. Um and I actually in the grand scheme. Um and I actually in the grand scheme. Um and I actually think if I were if I were doing this in think if I were if I were doing this in think if I were if I were doing this in practice, I would probably focus more on practice, I would probably focus more on practice, I would probably focus more on percentile because I would always want percentile because I would always want percentile because I would always want to do the top ones for whatever my to do the top ones for whatever my to do the top ones for whatever my capacity is. I wouldn't have a capacity is. I wouldn't have a capacity is. I wouldn't have a threshold. I would go off of that threshold. I would go off of that threshold. I would go off of that percentile and my capacity to remediate percentile and my capacity to remediate percentile and my capacity to remediate which is a whole other presentation. But which is a whole other presentation. But which is a whole other presentation. But this is what the percentile looks like this is what the percentile looks like this is what the percentile looks like when you plot it as a histogram. You get when you plot it as a histogram. You get when you plot it as a histogram. You get these bars and basically you get ties. these bars and basically you get ties. these bars and basically you get ties. So you get some fluctuations, but this So you get some fluctuations, but this So you get some fluctuations, but this basically every bar is 20 basically every bar is 20 basically every bar is 20 2,700 CVEes in a bar. Now if you think 2,700 CVEes in a bar. Now if you think 2,700 CVEes in a bar. Now if you think about this, what would you expect about this, what would you expect about this, what would you expect exploitation activity to look like? Like exploitation activity to look like? Like exploitation activity to look like? Like out of the 99th percentile, how many of out of the 99th percentile, how many of out of the 99th percentile, how many of those would you expect to be those would you expect to be those would you expect to be exploited? So we got exploited? So we got exploited? So we got 96% out of the 2700 96% out of the 2700 96% out of the 2700 uh in that top 1 percentile with uh in that top 1 percentile with uh in that top 1 percentile with exploitation activity and it drops down exploitation activity and it drops down exploitation activity and it drops down from there. So this is what it looks like when we So this is what it looks like when we So this is what it looks like when we look at the percentile. We're getting look at the percentile. We're getting look at the percentile. We're getting pretty good, you know, the the higher pretty good, you know, the the higher pretty good, you know, the the higher percentiles do have more exploitation percentiles do have more exploitation percentiles do have more exploitation activity and the probability captures activity and the probability captures activity and the probability captures just how much exploitation activity we just how much exploitation activity we just how much exploitation activity we should should should expect. All right, let's jump into expect. All right, let's jump into expect. All right, let's jump into variable importance because variable importance because variable importance because this this is an amazing chart. Um this this this is an amazing chart. Um this this this is an amazing chart. Um this took a long time to get here. Um, but took a long time to get here. Um, but took a long time to get here. Um, but we're looking at essentially all of we're looking at essentially all of we're looking at essentially all of the I guess meaningful variables to the the I guess meaningful variables to the the I guess meaningful variables to the model, but it's super hard. It's not model, but it's super hard. It's not model, but it's super hard. It's not like a linear regression where like a like a linear regression where like a like a linear regression where like a variable has a weight. That's not what variable has a weight. That's not what variable has a weight. That's not what happens in the in the newer complex happens in the in the newer complex happens in the in the newer complex machine learning models because a machine learning models because a machine learning models because a variable is going to have interaction variable is going to have interaction variable is going to have interaction effects. It's going to say, hey, this effects. It's going to say, hey, this effects. It's going to say, hey, this has a weight, but then wait a minute, has a weight, but then wait a minute, has a weight, but then wait a minute, it's a Microsoft VO and it's Microsoft V it's a Microsoft VO and it's Microsoft V it's a Microsoft VO and it's Microsoft V that's in metas-ploit. Now, this other that's in metas-ploit. Now, this other that's in metas-ploit. Now, this other variable has different meaning, right? variable has different meaning, right? variable has different meaning, right? And if you think about it, people do And if you think about it, people do And if you think about it, people do this too. Like, hey, it's a Microsoft this too. Like, hey, it's a Microsoft this too. Like, hey, it's a Microsoft phone. Whoa, that's bad. Or, you know, phone. Whoa, that's bad. Or, you know, phone. Whoa, that's bad. Or, you know, it's an Apache V that might be internet it's an Apache V that might be internet it's an Apache V that might be internet facing, right? You get these things and facing, right? You get these things and facing, right? You get these things and then more variables will change how you then more variables will change how you then more variables will change how you think about the first one. And that's think about the first one. And that's think about the first one. And that's exactly what the model is doing. So, exactly what the model is doing. So, exactly what the model is doing. So, what this is trying to do is to capture what this is trying to do is to capture what this is trying to do is to capture how many CVEes are influenced by a how many CVEes are influenced by a how many CVEes are influenced by a variable, either positive or negative, variable, either positive or negative, variable, either positive or negative, and then how much might they be and then how much might they be and then how much might they be influenced up or down. Um, and as you go influenced up or down. Um, and as you go influenced up or down. Um, and as you go down in the number of influenced, you're down in the number of influenced, you're down in the number of influenced, you're going to have more variation. So that's going to have more variation. So that's going to have more variation. So that's why you see that scale go wider. But up why you see that scale go wider. But up why you see that scale go wider. But up here, you see things like age. Every here, you see things like age. Every here, you see things like age. Every vulnerability has an age. Not every vulnerability has an age. Not every vulnerability has an age. Not every vulnerability is affected by the value vulnerability is affected by the value vulnerability is affected by the value of the age. So this this is not 270,000. of the age. So this this is not 270,000. of the age. So this this is not 270,000. This is, and I can't see the grid lines, This is, and I can't see the grid lines, This is, and I can't see the grid lines, but it is, I don't know, 200,000. I can but it is, I don't know, 200,000. I can but it is, I don't know, 200,000. I can see it on here. About 250,000. So not everything is affected 250,000. So not everything is affected 250,000. So not everything is affected by age. The count of references also by age. The count of references also by age. The count of references also fairly important. Everything has at fairly important. Everything has at fairly important. Everything has at least one reference and it's a little least one reference and it's a little least one reference and it's a little bit more impactful than age, but still bit more impactful than age, but still bit more impactful than age, but still not crazy important. But you can see the not crazy important. But you can see the not crazy important. But you can see the outliers. You can see the things that outliers. You can see the things that outliers. You can see the things that are really making a difference. Uh if are really making a difference. Uh if are really making a difference. Uh if there's an exploit on GitHub, if it's in there's an exploit on GitHub, if it's in there's an exploit on GitHub, if it's in exploit DB, Microsoft sticks out. Uh exploit DB, Microsoft sticks out. Uh exploit DB, Microsoft sticks out. Uh Nuclei, Metas-ploit, Kev, these things Nuclei, Metas-ploit, Kev, these things Nuclei, Metas-ploit, Kev, these things are all sticking out. And then you get are all sticking out. And then you get are all sticking out. And then you get top level things, you know, coming down top level things, you know, coming down top level things, you know, coming down here. here. here. And we could literally talk this could And we could literally talk this could And we could literally talk this could be like a whole talk just talking about be like a whole talk just talking about be like a whole talk just talking about these variable importance. But we can these variable importance. But we can these variable importance. But we can isolate things too. If we talk about the isolate things too. If we talk about the isolate things too. If we talk about the vectors from vectors from vectors from CVSS, you see this is probably a lot of CVSS, you see this is probably a lot of CVSS, you see this is probably a lot of V3 stuff. We get some V4 vectors down V3 stuff. We get some V4 vectors down V3 stuff. We get some V4 vectors down here. They're not affecting a lot, but here. They're not affecting a lot, but here. They're not affecting a lot, but there's some there's some there's some influence. We could also identify the influence. We could also identify the influence. We could also identify the top 22 categories from uh category 1400 top 22 categories from uh category 1400 top 22 categories from uh category 1400 and CWES and and how they fare. So like and CWES and and how they fare. So like and CWES and and how they fare. So like injection, there's a ton of injection injection, there's a ton of injection injection, there's a ton of injection vulnerabilities, access control, memory vulnerabilities, access control, memory vulnerabilities, access control, memory safety, input validation, safety, input validation, safety, input validation, um, and then some less things and um, and then some less things and um, and then some less things and because it's a smaller sample, you're because it's a smaller sample, you're because it's a smaller sample, you're going to get some more going to get some more going to get some more variation. And I was asked online the variation. And I was asked online the variation. And I was asked online the other day about the influence of sysv. other day about the influence of sysv. other day about the influence of sysv. And so I created this plot. I thought, And so I created this plot. I thought, And so I created this plot. I thought, man, I got to throw that in the slides. man, I got to throw that in the slides. man, I got to throw that in the slides. So this is sysv isolated for its value. So this is sysv isolated for its value. So this is sysv isolated for its value. So when something is on sizes kev So when something is on sizes kev So when something is on sizes kev generally it's a positive influence generally it's a positive influence generally it's a positive influence there are times when it's not when it's there are times when it's not when it's there are times when it's not when it's yes this is on sizes kev and the fact yes this is on sizes kev and the fact yes this is on sizes kev and the fact that it's on the kev actually lowers it that it's on the kev actually lowers it that it's on the kev actually lowers it for I don't know a dozen maybe a dozen for I don't know a dozen maybe a dozen for I don't know a dozen maybe a dozen and a half uh cvees are actually lowered and a half uh cvees are actually lowered and a half uh cvees are actually lowered when they're on sakev and again this is when they're on sakev and again this is when they're on sakev and again this is in the presence of everything else right in the presence of everything else right in the presence of everything else right so it's pretty interesting I think to so it's pretty interesting I think to so it's pretty interesting I think to think about that and conversely no when think about that and conversely no when think about that and conversely no when it's not on there generally it's no it's not on there generally it's no it's not on there generally it's no impact act it's at zero. Um but a lot of impact act it's at zero. Um but a lot of impact act it's at zero. Um but a lot of them do drop down to negative influence them do drop down to negative influence them do drop down to negative influence but there's a few that increase uh but there's a few that increase uh but there's a few that increase uh probability of exploitation when it's probability of exploitation when it's probability of exploitation when it's not on not on not on sysv which is bizarre but again it's sysv which is bizarre but again it's sysv which is bizarre but again it's like the the way the model works is that like the the way the model works is that like the the way the model works is that with all the other variables this is the with all the other variables this is the with all the other variables this is the actual weight of them. Yes sir. Yes I have a question. Have you Yes sir. Yes I have a question. Have you Yes sir. Yes I have a question. Have you ever considered publishing next to each ever considered publishing next to each ever considered publishing next to each score the variables? So people will have score the variables? So people will have score the variables? So people will have an easier time understanding why a an easier time understanding why a an easier time understanding why a certain CV got a certain EPSS score to certain CV got a certain EPSS score to certain CV got a certain EPSS score to publish why like the change in the publish why like the change in the publish why like the change in the variable just like if I type in uh like variable just like if I type in uh like variable just like if I type in uh like in the API or whatever when I type in a in the API or whatever when I type in a in the API or whatever when I type in a specific CV not just get the score but specific CV not just get the score but specific CV not just get the score but also get all its variables like right so also get all its variables like right so also get all its variables like right so we've got a there's a couple of we've got a there's a couple of we've got a there's a couple of challenges in doing that one is time challenges in doing that one is time challenges in doing that one is time that this is volunteer driven up to this that this is volunteer driven up to this that this is volunteer driven up to this point um and so to develop something point um and so to develop something point um and so to develop something like that is going to take more time the like that is going to take more time the like that is going to take more time the other thing is that there's some data in other thing is that there's some data in other thing is that there's some data in here that is purchased commercial data. here that is purchased commercial data. here that is purchased commercial data. So we can't release specific things So we can't release specific things So we can't release specific things contractually. Um so there could be a contractually. Um so there could be a contractually. Um so there could be a balance there that we could look at. Um balance there that we could look at. Um balance there that we could look at. Um but right now we have no plans to do but right now we have no plans to do but right now we have no plans to do that simply because it's a lot of work. that simply because it's a lot of work. that simply because it's a lot of work. Yeah. Because now when we see a score we Yeah. Because now when we see a score we Yeah. Because now when we see a score we just have to trust the model. We can't just have to trust the model. We can't just have to trust the model. We can't really understand why would this really understand why would this really understand why would this specific city get such a high score. specific city get such a high score. specific city get such a high score. Yeah. Yeah. And we do this all the time. Yeah. Yeah. And we do this all the time. Yeah. Yeah. And we do this all the time. Someone had a great example in our Slack Someone had a great example in our Slack Someone had a great example in our Slack where someone challenged that and they where someone challenged that and they where someone challenged that and they said when the weatherman says you've got said when the weatherman says you've got said when the weatherman says you've got a 50% chance of rain do you go call him a 50% chance of rain do you go call him a 50% chance of rain do you go call him and be like why you know why why do you and be like why you know why why do you and be like why you know why why do you think I need umbrella I don't really think I need umbrella I don't really think I need umbrella I don't really trust you why um but so yeah I mean we trust you why um but so yeah I mean we trust you why um but so yeah I mean we don't have that data um what we hope to don't have that data um what we hope to don't have that data um what we hope to do is through things like this where we do is through things like this where we do is through things like this where we talk about it we did a report last talk about it we did a report last talk about it we did a report last summer where we talked about performance summer where we talked about performance summer where we talked about performance and a bunch of other things through and a bunch of other things through and a bunch of other things through things like that we hope to build more things like that we hope to build more things like that we hope to build more confidence and hopefully there's going confidence and hopefully there's going confidence and hopefully there's going to be independent research that talks to be independent research that talks to be independent research that talks talks about and evaluates this and I can talks about and evaluates this and I can talks about and evaluates this and I can tell you it's not going to be perfect tell you it's not going to be perfect tell you it's not going to be perfect but we might find it's better than other but we might find it's better than other but we might find it's better than other things and maybe trust can be built up things and maybe trust can be built up things and maybe trust can be built up that way is what we're hoping for. Thank that way is what we're hoping for. Thank that way is what we're hoping for. Thank you. you. you. Yep. Um age I think is a really Yep. Um age I think is a really Yep. Um age I think is a really interesting thing. Um I did have to interesting thing. Um I did have to interesting thing. Um I did have to expand this out a little bit to talk expand this out a little bit to talk expand this out a little bit to talk about it but you see some density when about it but you see some density when about it but you see some density when it's young generally it reduces the it's young generally it reduces the it's young generally it reduces the probability of probability of probability of exploitation. Um that does not mean that exploitation. Um that does not mean that exploitation. Um that does not mean that zero day doesn't exist. that doesn't zero day doesn't exist. that doesn't zero day doesn't exist. that doesn't mean that things are exploited not mean that things are exploited not mean that things are exploited not exploited quickly because there are exploited quickly because there are exploited quickly because there are things where it's young and it's things where it's young and it's things where it's young and it's considerably higher in some of them. Um considerably higher in some of them. Um considerably higher in some of them. Um but we do see this trend and and last but we do see this trend and and last but we do see this trend and and last year at Vongcon I actually had plots year at Vongcon I actually had plots year at Vongcon I actually had plots talking about the age of things at talking about the age of things at talking about the age of things at exploitation and most of the exploitation and most of the exploitation and most of the exploitation actually is older stuff the exploitation actually is older stuff the exploitation actually is older stuff the newer stuff I think it was like 6% of newer stuff I think it was like 6% of newer stuff I think it was like 6% of all exploitation activity targeted all exploitation activity targeted all exploitation activity targeted things in the first year after things in the first year after things in the first year after publication 6%. So we do see see a lot publication 6%. So we do see see a lot publication 6%. So we do see see a lot of things older but there are things of things older but there are things of things older but there are things there are zero days there are things there are zero days there are things there are zero days there are things exploited within an hour of of exploited within an hour of of exploited within an hour of of publication even before that right after publication even before that right after publication even before that right after it but generally speaking uh I think it but generally speaking uh I think it but generally speaking uh I think we're seeing that a lot of the we're seeing that a lot of the we're seeing that a lot of the exploitation activity generally goes exploitation activity generally goes exploitation activity generally goes after more established more open things after more established more open things after more established more open things like like like that and this is just correlation too that and this is just correlation too that and this is just correlation too just to throw that usual qualification just to throw that usual qualification just to throw that usual qualification out there the number of references is out there the number of references is out there the number of references is also a pretty interesting vulnerability also a pretty interesting vulnerability also a pretty interesting vulnerability I mean a pretty interesting feature. Um, I mean a pretty interesting feature. Um, I mean a pretty interesting feature. Um, and generally what we see is when and generally what we see is when and generally what we see is when there's more references in a published there's more references in a published there's more references in a published CVE, uh, on CVE.org, uh, this is what CVE, uh, on CVE.org, uh, this is what CVE, uh, on CVE.org, uh, this is what we're seeing. When we get more we're seeing. When we get more we're seeing. When we get more references, generally it's going to references, generally it's going to references, generally it's going to increase the probability of increase the probability of increase the probability of exploitation. Um, and that sort of exploitation. Um, and that sort of exploitation. Um, and that sort of follows logic like if something is follows logic like if something is follows logic like if something is really important, more people are going really important, more people are going really important, more people are going to blog about it. There's going to be to blog about it. There's going to be to blog about it. There's going to be more resources, there's going to be more more resources, there's going to be more more resources, there's going to be more references. references. references. So, okay. So, okay. So, okay. Um looking forward I want to talk just Um looking forward I want to talk just Um looking forward I want to talk just generally about where we see EPSS going. generally about where we see EPSS going. generally about where we see EPSS going. Um I was also asked last week how how is Um I was also asked last week how how is Um I was also asked last week how how is EPSS doing? This is a count of um unique EPSS doing? This is a count of um unique EPSS doing? This is a count of um unique sources pulling down the EPSS data on a sources pulling down the EPSS data on a sources pulling down the EPSS data on a daily basis. So, starting in in 2000, I daily basis. So, starting in in 2000, I daily basis. So, starting in in 2000, I don't know, June of 2022, don't know, June of 2022, don't know, June of 2022, um I think that's when we released V2, um I think that's when we released V2, um I think that's when we released V2, um we start seeing the the daily um we start seeing the the daily um we start seeing the the daily downloads increase and we're up to I downloads increase and we're up to I downloads increase and we're up to I don't know maybe 6,000 daily bulk don't know maybe 6,000 daily bulk don't know maybe 6,000 daily bulk downloads and this isn't counting the downloads and this isn't counting the downloads and this isn't counting the API hits. Um and so we're seeing we're API hits. Um and so we're seeing we're API hits. Um and so we're seeing we're seeing adoption increase. seeing adoption increase. seeing adoption increase. Um so had to share that one. Uh so the Um so had to share that one. Uh so the Um so had to share that one. Uh so the road map uh we're going to be doing more road map uh we're going to be doing more road map uh we're going to be doing more frequent retraining. Two years is frequent retraining. Two years is frequent retraining. Two years is definitely too long to wait. We definitely too long to wait. We definitely too long to wait. We definitely saw some decay there. Uh we definitely saw some decay there. Uh we definitely saw some decay there. Uh we are continually searching for are continually searching for are continually searching for exploitation activity. So, if anybody exploitation activity. So, if anybody exploitation activity. So, if anybody either has at their company or they're either has at their company or they're either has at their company or they're buying it from somewhere or they have buying it from somewhere or they have buying it from somewhere or they have some secret sauce that they know about, some secret sauce that they know about, some secret sauce that they know about, we would love to talk to you and we would love to talk to you and we would love to talk to you and identify how we can incorporate that identify how we can incorporate that identify how we can incorporate that data into EPSS because of that problem data into EPSS because of that problem data into EPSS because of that problem where we've got false negatives, we've where we've got false negatives, we've where we've got false negatives, we've got false positives, we aren't seeing got false positives, we aren't seeing got false positives, we aren't seeing everything, and we're probably seeing everything, and we're probably seeing everything, and we're probably seeing too much at the same time. Uh, we want too much at the same time. Uh, we want too much at the same time. Uh, we want to enhance the malware detections that to enhance the malware detections that to enhance the malware detections that we have. We're going to be actually we have. We're going to be actually we have. We're going to be actually doing some interesting combinations of doing some interesting combinations of doing some interesting combinations of data sources to get more information out data sources to get more information out data sources to get more information out of what we already have. Um, we're going of what we already have. Um, we're going of what we already have. Um, we're going to enhance our web scraping and to enhance our web scraping and to enhance our web scraping and vulnerability tagging. Uh, and finally, vulnerability tagging. Uh, and finally, vulnerability tagging. Uh, and finally, because we've got some commercial because we've got some commercial because we've got some commercial backing, we're going to we're going to backing, we're going to we're going to backing, we're going to we're going to have more data opportunities open to us have more data opportunities open to us have more data opportunities open to us to include that moving to include that moving to include that moving forward. And with that, I can open up forward. And with that, I can open up forward. And with that, I can open up for questions. Uh, and I can talk about for questions. Uh, and I can talk about for questions. Uh, and I can talk about anything in here and or around this question up front here. Thank you, Jay. So, when I'm looking at Thank you, Jay. So, when I'm looking at Thank you, Jay. So, when I'm looking at that uh the the SHAP values on on the that uh the the SHAP values on on the that uh the the SHAP values on on the references, one of the things that references, one of the things that references, one of the things that occurs to me is that for certain occurs to me is that for certain occurs to me is that for certain variables, you're going to have really variables, you're going to have really variables, you're going to have really really really high crossorrelation, really really high crossorrelation, really really high crossorrelation, right? So, like if you have a bunch of right? So, like if you have a bunch of right? So, like if you have a bunch of references, one of them might be references, one of them might be references, one of them might be pointing to exploit DB and to, you know, pointing to exploit DB and to, you know, pointing to exploit DB and to, you know, metas-ploit and wherever else, right? So metas-ploit and wherever else, right? So metas-ploit and wherever else, right? So do you think that that has any any do you think that that has any any do you think that that has any any influence on the the longevity of it? Do influence on the the longevity of it? Do influence on the the longevity of it? Do you think that has any influence on the you think that has any influence on the you think that has any influence on the overfitting that you experienced and and overfitting that you experienced and and overfitting that you experienced and and did you do anything to kind of deal with did you do anything to kind of deal with did you do anything to kind of deal with that high crossorrelation? that high crossorrelation? that high crossorrelation? That's an excellent question and well That's an excellent question and well That's an excellent question and well wellinformed question too. Um yes there wellinformed question too. Um yes there wellinformed question too. Um yes there is there is things like that. Um and I is there is things like that. Um and I is there is things like that. Um and I haven't exper so there's things also haven't exper so there's things also haven't exper so there's things also where like an exploit is published in where like an exploit is published in where like an exploit is published in exploit DB and metas-ploit and they put exploit DB and metas-ploit and they put exploit DB and metas-ploit and they put it on GitHub. So like one exploit now it on GitHub. So like one exploit now it on GitHub. So like one exploit now counts in three places. Um and I think counts in three places. Um and I think counts in three places. Um and I think that does occur. Um it would be that does occur. Um it would be that does occur. Um it would be interesting to try and research that. I interesting to try and research that. I interesting to try and research that. I mean the problem I have is you know mean the problem I have is you know mean the problem I have is you know we've got how many data points? I mean we've got how many data points? I mean we've got how many data points? I mean just trying to define that. So that just trying to define that. So that just trying to define that. So that could be affecting it. Um and it could could be affecting it. Um and it could could be affecting it. Um and it could be I don't know how big it would be. I be I don't know how big it would be. I be I don't know how big it would be. I mean they're definitely they're in mean they're definitely they're in mean they're definitely they're in there. Um yeah I don't have a great there. Um yeah I don't have a great there. Um yeah I don't have a great answer. So yeah it's a hard problem. answer. So yeah it's a hard problem. answer. So yeah it's a hard problem. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yes. Earlier you mentioned EPSS Yes. Earlier you mentioned EPSS Yes. Earlier you mentioned EPSS accumulative like with a a roll up or a accumulative like with a a roll up or a accumulative like with a a roll up or a quarterly update. Um is there anything quarterly update. Um is there anything quarterly update. Um is there anything on your horizon where you will speak to on your horizon where you will speak to on your horizon where you will speak to that or address that? A lot of times that or address that? A lot of times that or address that? A lot of times that helps us to prioritize our business that helps us to prioritize our business that helps us to prioritize our business will say we want to wait 30 days to get will say we want to wait 30 days to get will say we want to wait 30 days to get past this product roll out or past this product roll out or past this product roll out or announcement. Should we do that or not? announcement. Should we do that or not? announcement. Should we do that or not? So we're leveraging EPSS, but it might So we're leveraging EPSS, but it might So we're leveraging EPSS, but it might have to do with a quarterly update have to do with a quarterly update have to do with a quarterly update release and it would be a lot more work release and it would be a lot more work release and it would be a lot more work for organization to for organization to for organization to addressilities as they come. So yeah. So addressilities as they come. So yeah. So addressilities as they come. So yeah. So one of the things so you're saying like one of the things so you're saying like one of the things so you're saying like uh if we're doing quarterly updates on uh if we're doing quarterly updates on uh if we're doing quarterly updates on the model the scores may jump. the model the scores may jump. the model the scores may jump. Well that yes now you're concerned about Well that yes now you're concerned about Well that yes now you're concerned about that. Yeah. Then should we be using the that. Yeah. Then should we be using the that. Yeah. Then should we be using the cumulative cumulative cumulative uh as a decision point? In other words, uh as a decision point? In other words, uh as a decision point? In other words, there's these six and each has an there's these six and each has an there's these six and each has an EPSS. And from a a math science EPSS. And from a a math science EPSS. And from a a math science perspective, is it a valid way of perspective, is it a valid way of perspective, is it a valid way of evaluating this rollup? Is it a evaluating this rollup? Is it a evaluating this rollup? Is it a cumulative use of the EPSS of all the cumulative use of the EPSS of all the cumulative use of the EPSS of all the individual vans? Is individual vans? Is individual vans? Is that bad math or bad decision-making that bad math or bad decision-making that bad math or bad decision-making criteria? I don't know if I quite criteria? I don't know if I quite criteria? I don't know if I quite understand your question. So, let's just understand your question. So, let's just understand your question. So, let's just use uh Oracle C quarterly update six use uh Oracle C quarterly update six use uh Oracle C quarterly update six vans eps is xyz you know right can we vans eps is xyz you know right can we vans eps is xyz you know right can we add those numbers up and say oh if we add those numbers up and say oh if we add those numbers up and say oh if we don't do this quarterly update then we don't do this quarterly update then we don't do this quarterly update then we have this right okay so combining the have this right okay so combining the have this right okay so combining the scores things like that yeah so because scores things like that yeah so because scores things like that yeah so because it's a probability you can like if you it's a probability you can like if you it's a probability you can like if you go to Google and you type in how do I go to Google and you type in how do I go to Google and you type in how do I combine probabilities you know and so combine probabilities you know and so combine probabilities you know and so the the the challenge is how you frame the the the challenge is how you frame the the the challenge is how you frame it so like what Stephen Schaefer talked it so like what Stephen Schaefer talked it so like what Stephen Schaefer talked about in his talk yesterday morning was about in his talk yesterday morning was about in his talk yesterday morning was he phrase it so like I have this asset he phrase it so like I have this asset he phrase it so like I have this asset that has 10 vulnerabilities on it. I that has 10 vulnerabilities on it. I that has 10 vulnerabilities on it. I want to know the probability that one or want to know the probability that one or want to know the probability that one or more are going to be exploited in the more are going to be exploited in the more are going to be exploited in the next 30 days. And so it would take the next 30 days. And so it would take the next 30 days. And so it would take the maximum and it would actually be maximum and it would actually be maximum and it would actually be increased above that whatever that is increased above that whatever that is increased above that whatever that is because you're combining all 10 because you're combining all 10 because you're combining all 10 vulnerabilities on there. So yeah, you vulnerabilities on there. So yeah, you vulnerabilities on there. So yeah, you could take a report and say here's six could take a report and say here's six could take a report and say here's six of them that were released. the EPSS is of them that were released. the EPSS is of them that were released. the EPSS is this and you know we can we can say what this and you know we can we can say what this and you know we can we can say what is the probability one or more are going is the probability one or more are going is the probability one or more are going to be exploited or two or more or what to be exploited or two or more or what to be exploited or two or more or what if all of them are going to be exploited if all of them are going to be exploited if all of them are going to be exploited you know thing we can do all of that you know thing we can do all of that you know thing we can do all of that math and it's just commonics on math and it's just commonics on math and it's just commonics on probability probability probability yep we've got a couple of questions on yep we've got a couple of questions on yep we've got a couple of questions on discord one from Adam what best practice discord one from Adam what best practice discord one from Adam what best practice do you recommend for an organization do you recommend for an organization do you recommend for an organization looking to integrate their scan data looking to integrate their scan data looking to integrate their scan data with eps data so the good news is that with eps data so the good news is that with eps data so the good news is that there's a lot of vendors that are there's a lot of vendors that are there's a lot of vendors that are incorporating EPSS into their products. incorporating EPSS into their products. incorporating EPSS into their products. Um, and I think most of the scanners are Um, and I think most of the scanners are Um, and I think most of the scanners are um, but if they aren't, I mean, like the um, but if they aren't, I mean, like the um, but if they aren't, I mean, like the the I showed that data and there's a the I showed that data and there's a the I showed that data and there's a link that you can just download a CSV link that you can just download a CSV link that you can just download a CSV that has all of it. So, you can just hit that has all of it. So, you can just hit that has all of it. So, you can just hit this link and there's one link that says this link and there's one link that says this link and there's one link that says like the EPSS current scores and you like the EPSS current scores and you like the EPSS current scores and you grab that and it it gives you the grab that and it it gives you the grab that and it it gives you the current score. So you can like hardcode current score. So you can like hardcode current score. So you can like hardcode that URL and it will always return that URL and it will always return that URL and it will always return today's dump of data and you can just today's dump of data and you can just today's dump of data and you can just grab that CSV and hopefully it's grab that CSV and hopefully it's grab that CSV and hopefully it's relatively straightforward to integrate relatively straightforward to integrate relatively straightforward to integrate that with an output from your that with an output from your that with an output from your vulnerability scanner and or to import vulnerability scanner and or to import vulnerability scanner and or to import it into Service Now or Splunk or it into Service Now or Splunk or it into Service Now or Splunk or whatever whatever you have. whatever whatever you have. whatever whatever you have. Got another question. Um we think we saw Got another question. Um we think we saw Got another question. Um we think we saw some scores bouncing up and down in the some scores bouncing up and down in the some scores bouncing up and down in the last two to three weeks. It looks like last two to three weeks. It looks like last two to three weeks. It looks like V4 is not yet stable or or is still V4 is not yet stable or or is still V4 is not yet stable or or is still being updated. Is that something that being updated. Is that something that being updated. Is that something that you recognize it? I I recognize that you recognize it? I I recognize that you recognize it? I I recognize that there's uh scores, I guess we could say, there's uh scores, I guess we could say, there's uh scores, I guess we could say, jumping around. Um, one of the jumping around. Um, one of the jumping around. Um, one of the interesting bits is that there's so many interesting bits is that there's so many interesting bits is that there's so many more more more variables. How much would we expect variables. How much would we expect variables. How much would we expect things to jump around and how much is things to jump around and how much is things to jump around and how much is right versus wrong? I mean like um I did right versus wrong? I mean like um I did right versus wrong? I mean like um I did identify in the first week um our GitHub identify in the first week um our GitHub identify in the first week um our GitHub classifier was a little bit overzealous classifier was a little bit overzealous classifier was a little bit overzealous and so was putting a little bit more in and so was putting a little bit more in and so was putting a little bit more in there than it should have and so we're there than it should have and so we're there than it should have and so we're in the process of still fixing that but in the process of still fixing that but in the process of still fixing that but that is not any cause of the variability that is not any cause of the variability that is not any cause of the variability at this moment. Um but there is more and at this moment. Um but there is more and at this moment. Um but there is more and so my thought was after this conference so my thought was after this conference so my thought was after this conference I would go back and try to figure out I would go back and try to figure out I would go back and try to figure out why we're seeing this variability you why we're seeing this variability you why we're seeing this variability you know and try to talk about it and think know and try to talk about it and think know and try to talk about it and think about it and discuss it. Um part of the about it and discuss it. Um part of the about it and discuss it. Um part of the joy of this is that this is not none of joy of this is that this is not none of joy of this is that this is not none of this model is a conscious effort. Um so this model is a conscious effort. Um so this model is a conscious effort. Um so it's a lot of mathematics and sort of it's a lot of mathematics and sort of it's a lot of mathematics and sort of training to the activity. So there might training to the activity. So there might training to the activity. So there might be some artifacts that are interesting be some artifacts that are interesting be some artifacts that are interesting like maybe there is this variability you like maybe there is this variability you like maybe there is this variability you know and actually we see this in the know and actually we see this in the know and actually we see this in the exploitation activity. We see very exploitation activity. We see very exploitation activity. We see very bursty and we see nothing and we see bursty and we see nothing and we see bursty and we see nothing and we see bursty and nothing and we see some that bursty and nothing and we see some that bursty and nothing and we see some that are hitting like couple of days a month. are hitting like couple of days a month. are hitting like couple of days a month. Um, and so we're seeing that sort of Um, and so we're seeing that sort of Um, and so we're seeing that sort of really sporadic activity and I don't really sporadic activity and I don't really sporadic activity and I don't know if the feature data is going to know if the feature data is going to know if the feature data is going to reflect that or not, but this is, you reflect that or not, but this is, you reflect that or not, but this is, you know, avenue for for more research. So know, avenue for for more research. So know, avenue for for more research. So yes, there's more variability. I don't yes, there's more variability. I don't yes, there's more variability. I don't know if it's wrong. Yes, I have a know if it's wrong. Yes, I have a know if it's wrong. Yes, I have a question that just occurred to me. Have question that just occurred to me. Have question that just occurred to me. Have you ever observed a phenomenon where you ever observed a phenomenon where you ever observed a phenomenon where basically the results that you publish basically the results that you publish basically the results that you publish then lead to more people trying out the then lead to more people trying out the then lead to more people trying out the exploitation? So basically attackers exploitation? So basically attackers exploitation? So basically attackers using the the EPSS as oh this seems using the the EPSS as oh this seems using the the EPSS as oh this seems interesting. I'm going to try this out. interesting. I'm going to try this out. interesting. I'm going to try this out. Yeah, I haven't I no one has Yeah, I haven't I no one has Yeah, I haven't I no one has communicated that to me. Um I guess it communicated that to me. Um I guess it communicated that to me. Um I guess it wouldn't surprise me. What what I would wouldn't surprise me. What what I would wouldn't surprise me. What what I would expect more likely is that would they expect more likely is that would they expect more likely is that would they would look for a lower score that people would look for a lower score that people would look for a lower score that people may be slower to patch and think, all may be slower to patch and think, all may be slower to patch and think, all right, I'm going to go try that one. Um right, I'm going to go try that one. Um right, I'm going to go try that one. Um and that that might be a good thing. I and that that might be a good thing. I and that that might be a good thing. I don't I think any anything we can do to don't I think any anything we can do to don't I think any anything we can do to make them think and change different, make them think and change different, make them think and change different, you know, as opposed to taking something you know, as opposed to taking something you know, as opposed to taking something that might be really easy to exploit. Um that might be really easy to exploit. Um that might be really easy to exploit. Um yeah. Okay. The the one thing that I did yeah. Okay. The the one thing that I did yeah. Okay. The the one thing that I did find interesting is that there is a find interesting is that there is a find interesting is that there is a really really strong correlation between really really strong correlation between really really strong correlation between exploit code being published and exploit code being published and exploit code being published and available and activity. Mhm. That um it available and activity. Mhm. That um it available and activity. Mhm. That um it might be something where we might be might be something where we might be might be something where we might be shooting ourselves in the feet a little shooting ourselves in the feet a little shooting ourselves in the feet a little bit to put code out there to break into bit to put code out there to break into bit to put code out there to break into our companies. Um but I know there's a our companies. Um but I know there's a our companies. Um but I know there's a lot of benefits to it too. So it's hard lot of benefits to it too. So it's hard lot of benefits to it too. So it's hard to say, you know, this is the USB drive to say, you know, this is the USB drive to say, you know, this is the USB drive problem again. Do we just disable it all problem again. Do we just disable it all problem again. Do we just disable it all or you know? But yeah. So it's got got a or you know? But yeah. So it's got got a or you know? But yeah. So it's got got a question back here. Yeah. Uh, with the question back here. Yeah. Uh, with the question back here. Yeah. Uh, with the commercial backing you mentioned, is commercial backing you mentioned, is commercial backing you mentioned, is there going to be any changes to the there going to be any changes to the there going to be any changes to the accessibility of the EPSS data? accessibility of the EPSS data? accessibility of the EPSS data? No. Great question. No. And I want to No. Great question. No. And I want to No. Great question. No. And I want to make that really clear because we're make that really clear because we're make that really clear because we're going to keep EPSS exactly as it is, going to keep EPSS exactly as it is, going to keep EPSS exactly as it is, even better because we got commercial even better because we got commercial even better because we got commercial data. So, the scores are going to data. So, the scores are going to data. So, the scores are going to continue to be published daily. Um, continue to be published daily. Um, continue to be published daily. Um, hopefully with this, we're going to have hopefully with this, we're going to have hopefully with this, we're going to have much better monitoring. Uh, really much better monitoring. Uh, really much better monitoring. Uh, really excited for that. Uh but yeah, it's it's excited for that. Uh but yeah, it's it's excited for that. Uh but yeah, it's it's hopefully it's going to be better hopefully it's going to be better hopefully it's going to be better because we've got commercial data and because we've got commercial data and because we've got commercial data and we're just going to luckily EPSS is does we're just going to luckily EPSS is does we're just going to luckily EPSS is does not have a lot of bells and whistles. not have a lot of bells and whistles. not have a lot of bells and whistles. Like I said, it's a CVE score and Like I said, it's a CVE score and Like I said, it's a CVE score and percentile that's going to continue for percentile that's going to continue for percentile that's going to continue for as long as I have any say in the whole as long as I have any say in the whole as long as I have any say in the whole future which is going to be for many future which is going to be for many future which is going to be for many many years. Yes. So we wonder if the CVE many years. Yes. So we wonder if the CVE many years. Yes. So we wonder if the CVE is put into KV. So do you see any data is put into KV. So do you see any data is put into KV. So do you see any data showing EPSS shooting to the sky? showing EPSS shooting to the sky? showing EPSS shooting to the sky? Uh that would be very valid, you know, Uh that would be very valid, you know, Uh that would be very valid, you know, for hikers to hike into low CVS. So if a for hikers to hike into low CVS. So if a for hikers to hike into low CVS. So if a CVE is added to the KV Yes. and then CVE is added to the KV Yes. and then CVE is added to the KV Yes. and then EPSS shoots up. Yeah. Do you see that? EPSS shoots up. Yeah. Do you see that? EPSS shoots up. Yeah. Do you see that? Uh yes. I haven't looked, but yes, I'm Uh yes. I haven't looked, but yes, I'm Uh yes. I haven't looked, but yes, I'm pretty sure there are some that would pretty sure there are some that would pretty sure there are some that would react to it positively. I mean, we see react to it positively. I mean, we see react to it positively. I mean, we see that in the in the Shappley stuff. Yeah. that in the in the Shappley stuff. Yeah. that in the in the Shappley stuff. Yeah. So that's very valid, right? Yeah. But So that's very valid, right? Yeah. But So that's very valid, right? Yeah. But there are some that get added to the there are some that get added to the there are some that get added to the cabin. It doesn't shift much also. cabin. It doesn't shift much also. cabin. It doesn't shift much also. What's the reason behind that? Do you What's the reason behind that? Do you What's the reason behind that? Do you know what's the reason behind that? The know what's the reason behind that? The know what's the reason behind that? The course. So there there's like 2500 course. So there there's like 2500 course. So there there's like 2500 variables and again the weight of any variables and again the weight of any variables and again the weight of any individual variable is actually individual variable is actually individual variable is actually dependent on the the value of other dependent on the the value of other dependent on the the value of other variables. You need to tune up, right? variables. You need to tune up, right? variables. You need to tune up, right? You need to tune up those variables to You need to tune up those variables to You need to tune up those variables to make the number go. The the model is make the number go. The the model is make the number go. The the model is tuned. The variables themselves are not tuned. The variables themselves are not tuned. The variables themselves are not tuned. If that made sense. Yeah, I tuned. If that made sense. Yeah, I tuned. If that made sense. Yeah, I understand that. But you need to either understand that. But you need to either understand that. But you need to either improve the model or do something to to improve the model or do something to to improve the model or do something to to either include them or not include them. either include them or not include them. either include them or not include them. Yeah. To see you know which variable can Yeah. To see you know which variable can Yeah. To see you know which variable can be ignored. Then you can see the score be ignored. Then you can see the score be ignored. Then you can see the score going up. Yeah. The the the algorithm is going up. Yeah. The the the algorithm is going up. Yeah. The the the algorithm is really complex honestly. I mean like really complex honestly. I mean like really complex honestly. I mean like there's so much stuff in there. Um yeah, there's so much stuff in there. Um yeah, there's so much stuff in there. Um yeah, there's going to be some weird things there's going to be some weird things there's going to be some weird things that like that where we're going to see that like that where we're going to see that like that where we're going to see it either jump up or not jump up much it either jump up or not jump up much it either jump up or not jump up much for the same variable. The the KEV is a what' you say it's a The the KEV is a what' you say it's a The the KEV is a what' you say it's a big big big thing. thing. thing. Okay. Yeah. It's known to hackers, I Okay. Yeah. It's known to hackers, I Okay. Yeah. It's known to hackers, I think. Yeah. Yeah. And I mean, as we think. Yeah. Yeah. And I mean, as we think. Yeah. Yeah. And I mean, as we talked about, there's things that are talked about, there's things that are talked about, there's things that are being exploited that nobody knows about, being exploited that nobody knows about, being exploited that nobody knows about, and there's things that aren't on the and there's things that aren't on the and there's things that aren't on the kev that are being exploited, and kev that are being exploited, and kev that are being exploited, and there's different rules to be on the KV, there's different rules to be on the KV, there's different rules to be on the KV, things like that. things like that. things like that. So, So, So, okay. I think we're at time actually okay. I think we're at time actually okay. I think we're at time actually because we got another talk that's going because we got another talk that's going because we got another talk that's going to come in here. But Jay, thanks so much to come in here. But Jay, thanks so much to come in here. But Jay, thanks so much for taking the time to share all this.
