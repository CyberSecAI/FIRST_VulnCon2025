Talk about uh thoughts and processes. Talk about uh thoughts and processes. Talk about with Tanya, you know, what we've done in with Tanya, you know, what we've done in with Tanya, you know, what we've done in the past as well. Um I oversee the past as well. Um I oversee the past as well. Um I oversee um security standards, metrics and um security standards, metrics and um security standards, metrics and measurements, NVD being one of them um measurements, NVD being one of them um measurements, NVD being one of them um for the US and for the US government um for the US and for the US government um for the US and for the US government um to include NVD but a couple other things to include NVD but a couple other things to include NVD but a couple other things as well. Um so happy to be here. Thank as well. Um so happy to be here. Thank as well. Um so happy to be here. Thank you. How how was that? Was that okay? you. How how was that? Was that okay? you. How how was that? Was that okay? Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. So really briefly for those who Okay. So really briefly for those who Okay. So really briefly for those who aren't as familiar, this is where our aren't as familiar, this is where our aren't as familiar, this is where our data comes from and uh it's the 10,000 data comes from and uh it's the 10,000 data comes from and uh it's the 10,000 meter view because this slide was used meter view because this slide was used meter view because this slide was used in uh APERT and I I kindly put it metric in uh APERT and I I kindly put it metric in uh APERT and I I kindly put it metric for everybody. Um so our main data comes for everybody. Um so our main data comes for everybody. Um so our main data comes from the CVE list but we also get from the CVE list but we also get from the CVE list but we also get translations into Spanish of translations into Spanish of translations into Spanish of descriptions from incay who gives us descriptions from incay who gives us descriptions from incay who gives us volunteers. volunteers. volunteers. We also take in the Kev data, the known We also take in the Kev data, the known We also take in the Kev data, the known exploited vulnerability catalog data exploited vulnerability catalog data exploited vulnerability catalog data every night and add that to NVD records every night and add that to NVD records every night and add that to NVD records and we prioritize based on Kev and we prioritize based on Kev and we prioritize based on Kev records and then it goes out the door. records and then it goes out the door. records and then it goes out the door. We do some enrichment and it goes out We do some enrichment and it goes out We do some enrichment and it goes out the door and the two main users for what the door and the two main users for what the door and the two main users for what we do are scanning tool we do are scanning tool we do are scanning tool manufacturers and you know people who manufacturers and you know people who manufacturers and you know people who just use our data on their own. just use our data on their own. just use our data on their own. particularly our our mission is to help particularly our our mission is to help particularly our our mission is to help serve US government agencies, but we serve US government agencies, but we serve US government agencies, but we really serve an international really serve an international really serve an international population. On any given month, we have population. On any given month, we have population. On any given month, we have hits um to our data from about 160 hits um to our data from about 160 hits um to our data from about 160 countries worldwide. Okay. So, what have we done worldwide. Okay. So, what have we done worldwide. Okay. So, what have we done since the last fall con? First couple of since the last fall con? First couple of since the last fall con? First couple of bullets are yours, Matt. Okay. So, uh Tanya was here last year Okay. So, uh Tanya was here last year Okay. So, uh Tanya was here last year with the team. We talked about uh with the team. We talked about uh with the team. We talked about uh looking at and developing uh some looking at and developing uh some looking at and developing uh some consortia or some more formalized ways consortia or some more formalized ways consortia or some more formalized ways to engage with the external communities. to engage with the external communities. to engage with the external communities. Some of which Tanya talked about Some of which Tanya talked about Some of which Tanya talked about industry, academia, um some of our industry, academia, um some of our industry, academia, um some of our international partners. Um the international partners. Um the international partners. Um the mechanisms to do that especially at NIST mechanisms to do that especially at NIST mechanisms to do that especially at NIST is called the cooperative research and is called the cooperative research and is called the cooperative research and development agreement. Um, another development agreement. Um, another development agreement. Um, another acronym to throw onto this heavily acronym to throw onto this heavily acronym to throw onto this heavily acronymized uh, workshop, the CRADA. Uh, acronymized uh, workshop, the CRADA. Uh, acronymized uh, workshop, the CRADA. Uh, and the CRADA is a legal agreement. Um, and the CRADA is a legal agreement. Um, and the CRADA is a legal agreement. Um, legal agreements then need to be legal agreements then need to be legal agreements then need to be serviced by both lawyers and principal serviced by both lawyers and principal serviced by both lawyers and principal investigators or PIs on the N side. As investigators or PIs on the N side. As investigators or PIs on the N side. As we looked at that, we thought we might we looked at that, we thought we might we looked at that, we thought we might be overengineering and making something be overengineering and making something be overengineering and making something a little heavier weight than needed to a little heavier weight than needed to a little heavier weight than needed to be in order to engage with that be in order to engage with that be in order to engage with that stakeholder community. So Tanya and the stakeholder community. So Tanya and the stakeholder community. So Tanya and the team came back and said, "Yeah, this is team came back and said, "Yeah, this is team came back and said, "Yeah, this is a great mechanism, but um when we look a great mechanism, but um when we look a great mechanism, but um when we look at staff priorities, resource at staff priorities, resource at staff priorities, resource priorities, um we have other issues in priorities, um we have other issues in priorities, um we have other issues in the immediiacy that we need to deal the immediiacy that we need to deal the immediiacy that we need to deal with. So let's deal with those and then with. So let's deal with those and then with. So let's deal with those and then as we set up into future strategic as we set up into future strategic as we set up into future strategic areas we can achieve a lot of the areas we can achieve a lot of the areas we can achieve a lot of the objectives that have been discussed and objectives that have been discussed and objectives that have been discussed and that Tanya will talk about for our next that Tanya will talk about for our next that Tanya will talk about for our next kind of two to five year outlook. kind of two to five year outlook. kind of two to five year outlook. Working on automation working on data Working on automation working on data Working on automation working on data quality um setting ourselves up for uh quality um setting ourselves up for uh quality um setting ourselves up for uh use of submitted data rather than uh use of submitted data rather than uh use of submitted data rather than uh generating data ourselves. trying to get generating data ourselves. trying to get generating data ourselves. trying to get out of the business of data quality and out of the business of data quality and out of the business of data quality and data QA uh these types of things um that data QA uh these types of things um that data QA uh these types of things um that we were looking at through these we were looking at through these we were looking at through these consortia. We don't need the creatives consortia. We don't need the creatives consortia. We don't need the creatives to do that because of the organic to do that because of the organic to do that because of the organic authorities that NIST has and our authorities that NIST has and our authorities that NIST has and our abilities just to work openly um abilities just to work openly um abilities just to work openly um especially as a non-regulatory body. Um especially as a non-regulatory body. Um especially as a non-regulatory body. Um the crater really was not necessary. Um the crater really was not necessary. Um the crater really was not necessary. Um so we're going to continue to work on so we're going to continue to work on so we're going to continue to work on those work streams that were identified. those work streams that were identified. those work streams that were identified. Um but we're going to do it in a lower Um but we're going to do it in a lower Um but we're going to do it in a lower level more informal manner than having level more informal manner than having level more informal manner than having official legally binding craters or official legally binding craters or official legally binding craters or consorcia cred um which like I said consorcia cred um which like I said consorcia cred um which like I said while uh having more legal structure while uh having more legal structure while uh having more legal structure around it uh provides for significant around it uh provides for significant around it uh provides for significant more overhead. Um, so this will allow us more overhead. Um, so this will allow us more overhead. Um, so this will allow us a little more flexibility. This will a little more flexibility. This will a little more flexibility. This will allow for potentially a little more allow for potentially a little more allow for potentially a little more different and larger participation. Um, different and larger participation. Um, different and larger participation. Um, and it allow us to hopefully enact this and it allow us to hopefully enact this and it allow us to hopefully enact this uh a little bit quicker as well. Um, uh a little bit quicker as well. Um, uh a little bit quicker as well. Um, with fewer resources and overhead at the with fewer resources and overhead at the with fewer resources and overhead at the same time. You may have heard that uh same time. You may have heard that uh same time. You may have heard that uh government is looking at efficiencies government is looking at efficiencies government is looking at efficiencies for the future. Um, you may not have, I for the future. Um, you may not have, I for the future. Um, you may not have, I don't know. Um so one of the things when don't know. Um so one of the things when don't know. Um so one of the things when we looked at is how can we do this in we looked at is how can we do this in we looked at is how can we do this in the most efficient and nimble manner and the most efficient and nimble manner and the most efficient and nimble manner and so we said the creator is not the way so we said the creator is not the way so we said the creator is not the way doing this in open deliberative and uh doing this in open deliberative and uh doing this in open deliberative and uh consensus based manners with those consensus based manners with those consensus based manners with those stakeholders similar that we do with a stakeholders similar that we do with a stakeholders similar that we do with a standard a specification or a standard a specification or a standard a specification or a publication a workshop or a conference publication a workshop or a conference publication a workshop or a conference um is the way we're going to look at um is the way we're going to look at um is the way we're going to look at going forward on that going forward on that going forward on that um I said things have been a little uh um I said things have been a little uh um I said things have been a little uh disruptive and we've been going through disruptive and we've been going through disruptive and we've been going through times of change across the board. Um, as times of change across the board. Um, as times of change across the board. Um, as those have been happening, uh, myself those have been happening, uh, myself those have been happening, uh, myself and leadership above me have and leadership above me have and leadership above me have continuously and continually reaffirmed continuously and continually reaffirmed continuously and continually reaffirmed that, uh, the that, uh, the that, uh, the NVD and the underlying specifications NVD and the underlying specifications NVD and the underlying specifications and data that, uh, NIST is responsible and data that, uh, NIST is responsible and data that, uh, NIST is responsible for in NVD is and will continue to be a for in NVD is and will continue to be a for in NVD is and will continue to be a mission priority area for NIST. Um, both mission priority area for NIST. Um, both mission priority area for NIST. Um, both in resourcing and continuation of in resourcing and continuation of in resourcing and continuation of staffing and capabilities. uh both at staffing and capabilities. uh both at staffing and capabilities. uh both at current and at growth levels for our current and at growth levels for our current and at growth levels for our future. So I have assured the teams and future. So I have assured the teams and future. So I have assured the teams and leadership above me at NIST has assured leadership above me at NIST has assured leadership above me at NIST has assured me and everyone uh that NVD is a mission me and everyone uh that NVD is a mission me and everyone uh that NVD is a mission priority and will continue to be a priority and will continue to be a priority and will continue to be a mission priority for NIST as the mission priority for NIST as the mission priority for NIST as the national uh metrology institute the USNI national uh metrology institute the USNI national uh metrology institute the USNI as providing a measurement reference as providing a measurement reference as providing a measurement reference data for software and software security data for software and software security data for software and software security um going forward. um going forward. um going forward. So, I think those are my two bullets, So, I think those are my two bullets, So, I think those are my two bullets, Tanya. Right. All right. Those are my Tanya. Right. All right. Those are my Tanya. Right. All right. Those are my two bullets. Hello. Hello. Okay, now we're bullets. Hello. Hello. Okay, now we're bullets. Hello. Hello. Okay, now we're back on. Um, so what else have we done? back on. Um, so what else have we done? back on. Um, so what else have we done? We put after our little bit of a pause We put after our little bit of a pause We put after our little bit of a pause last spring, we put an entirely new last spring, we put an entirely new last spring, we put an entirely new enrichment team and an entirely new enrichment team and an entirely new enrichment team and an entirely new development team into place. Got them, development team into place. Got them, development team into place. Got them, you know, equipped, credentialed, and up you know, equipped, credentialed, and up you know, equipped, credentialed, and up to speed. And getting brand new teams to speed. And getting brand new teams to speed. And getting brand new teams with this kind of work up to speed can with this kind of work up to speed can with this kind of work up to speed can take a little bit of a minute. I mean, take a little bit of a minute. I mean, take a little bit of a minute. I mean, just imagine for those of you with dev just imagine for those of you with dev just imagine for those of you with dev teams, if you lost everyone on your dev teams, if you lost everyone on your dev teams, if you lost everyone on your dev team and several months later you had to team and several months later you had to team and several months later you had to start with a completely new dev team start with a completely new dev team start with a completely new dev team learning your codebase. This is kind of learning your codebase. This is kind of learning your codebase. This is kind of where we found ourselves. So, it took a where we found ourselves. So, it took a where we found ourselves. So, it took a minute. Um, it was a lot of work, but we minute. Um, it was a lot of work, but we minute. Um, it was a lot of work, but we have great teams in place now and have great teams in place now and have great teams in place now and they're not going they're not going they're not going anywhere. We also are in there's a word anywhere. We also are in there's a word anywhere. We also are in there's a word missing from this next bullet. But we missing from this next bullet. But we missing from this next bullet. But we also created a new mission statement. also created a new mission statement. also created a new mission statement. Um, it was time. We needed a new mission Um, it was time. We needed a new mission Um, it was time. We needed a new mission statement and we'll get to that in just statement and we'll get to that in just statement and we'll get to that in just a minute. Okay. So, we updated and minute. Okay. So, we updated and minute. Okay. So, we updated and upgraded internal systems to be able to upgraded internal systems to be able to upgraded internal systems to be able to fully ingest and utilize ADP data. It fully ingest and utilize ADP data. It fully ingest and utilize ADP data. It actually took us two tries to do this actually took us two tries to do this actually took us two tries to do this because when we started we were because when we started we were because when we started we were concerned about getting venrichment data concerned about getting venrichment data concerned about getting venrichment data directly from SISA in the wake of our directly from SISA in the wake of our directly from SISA in the wake of our hiccup last year and all of a sudden the hiccup last year and all of a sudden the hiccup last year and all of a sudden the data was available through an ADP data was available through an ADP data was available through an ADP mechanism and we went you know we are mechanism and we went you know we are mechanism and we went you know we are going to need to be able to use ADP data going to need to be able to use ADP data going to need to be able to use ADP data for whatever ADPs show up in the future. for whatever ADPs show up in the future. for whatever ADPs show up in the future. So we stopped and we took a second run So we stopped and we took a second run So we stopped and we took a second run at it and now we are able to take in and at it and now we are able to take in and at it and now we are able to take in and actually use ADP data from all ADPs actually use ADP data from all ADPs actually use ADP data from all ADPs including the CBE including the CBE including the CBE ADP. Um we have a proof of concept tool ADP. Um we have a proof of concept tool ADP. Um we have a proof of concept tool that was made that should be able to in that was made that should be able to in that was made that should be able to in using the CPE applicability statements using the CPE applicability statements using the CPE applicability statements that are hopefully going to be going that are hopefully going to be going that are hopefully going to be going into the CVE list. We have a tool that into the CVE list. We have a tool that into the CVE list. We have a tool that we think is going to lead us to we think is going to lead us to we think is going to lead us to automating CPE creation using those automating CPE creation using those automating CPE creation using those applicability statements in the near applicability statements in the near applicability statements in the near future. Um, we overhauled our internal future. Um, we overhauled our internal future. Um, we overhauled our internal van console that our enrichment team van console that our enrichment team van console that our enrichment team uses. It was a significant overhaul. It uses. It was a significant overhaul. It uses. It was a significant overhaul. It got us a lot of efficiencies. It got us got us a lot of efficiencies. It got us got us a lot of efficiencies. It got us a lot of improvements. It increased our a lot of improvements. It increased our a lot of improvements. It increased our flow flow flow through. We through. We through. We uh this changed I got told last second uh this changed I got told last second uh this changed I got told last second the last bullet is something that's the last bullet is something that's the last bullet is something that's going to happen within the next 2 to 3 going to happen within the next 2 to 3 going to happen within the next 2 to 3 months. We are overhauling our search months. We are overhauling our search months. We are overhauling our search engine so that there will be an advanced engine so that there will be an advanced engine so that there will be an advanced button that will open a list of things button that will open a list of things button that will open a list of things on the left side. You will be able to on the left side. You will be able to on the left side. You will be able to search by CNA and you will be able to search by CNA and you will be able to search by CNA and you will be able to search by ADP. search by ADP. search by ADP. much better than what our search much better than what our search much better than what our search capability has been in the past. The APIs, especially the VN API, past. The APIs, especially the VN API, past. The APIs, especially the VN API, had a lot of problems not long ago. I'm had a lot of problems not long ago. I'm had a lot of problems not long ago. I'm sure people in the room noticed. Um, we sure people in the room noticed. Um, we sure people in the room noticed. Um, we were having a lot of 503 errors. We did were having a lot of 503 errors. We did were having a lot of 503 errors. We did an overhaul. We made a lot of changes. an overhaul. We made a lot of changes. an overhaul. We made a lot of changes. We now have the best performance and the We now have the best performance and the We now have the best performance and the best stability we've ever had with our best stability we've ever had with our best stability we've ever had with our APIs. We've had no more problems with APIs. We've had no more problems with APIs. We've had no more problems with our APIs since our latest deployment of our APIs since our latest deployment of our APIs since our latest deployment of the the the upgrades. The fonttology, it's further upgrades. The fonttology, it's further upgrades. The fonttology, it's further along the road. Later this year, we will along the road. Later this year, we will along the road. Later this year, we will be putting out an announcement. Please be putting out an announcement. Please be putting out an announcement. Please come try to use the fonttology. Please come try to use the fonttology. Please come try to use the fonttology. Please come bang on it. We need feedback. We come bang on it. We need feedback. We come bang on it. We need feedback. We need to know, did we get it right? We need to know, did we get it right? We need to know, did we get it right? We need to know what's missing. We need to need to know what's missing. We need to need to know what's missing. We need to know how can it still be improved. We're know how can it still be improved. We're know how can it still be improved. We're wanting this to actually be a thing that wanting this to actually be a thing that wanting this to actually be a thing that is usable and we are working on is usable and we are working on is usable and we are working on finishing up the UI right now. So, in finishing up the UI right now. So, in finishing up the UI right now. So, in hopefully the summer, we'll be putting hopefully the summer, we'll be putting hopefully the summer, we'll be putting this out to the this out to the this out to the public to let you come play with it and public to let you come play with it and public to let you come play with it and tell us, did we miss the mark or are we tell us, did we miss the mark or are we tell us, did we miss the mark or are we okay? Okay, everybody can read. I'm going to Okay, everybody can read. I'm going to Okay, everybody can read. I'm going to give you a second. This is the new give you a second. This is the new give you a second. This is the new mission mission mission statement. We thought it was important statement. We thought it was important statement. We thought it was important to have one that is updated for where we to have one that is updated for where we to have one that is updated for where we are now. And I I I'm not going to read it to now. And I I I'm not going to read it to now. And I I I'm not going to read it to you because I hate people who read you because I hate people who read you because I hate people who read directly off of slides and don't tell directly off of slides and don't tell directly off of slides and don't tell you anything further. Um, but we wanted you anything further. Um, but we wanted you anything further. Um, but we wanted to get something a little more updated. to get something a little more updated. to get something a little more updated. Is everybody good? Can I go on? Nods. Is everybody good? Can I go on? Nods. Is everybody good? Can I go on? Nods. Okay. So, how we meet this depends on Okay. So, how we meet this depends on Okay. So, how we meet this depends on who you are and what your use case is. who you are and what your use case is. who you are and what your use case is. We meet this mission in a lot of ways. We meet this mission in a lot of ways. We meet this mission in a lot of ways. If you're a tool manufacturer, how we If you're a tool manufacturer, how we If you're a tool manufacturer, how we meet this mission for you is different meet this mission for you is different meet this mission for you is different than if you are someone using OAS than if you are someone using OAS than if you are someone using OAS dependency dependency dependency checker. We fulfill a lot of needs for a checker. We fulfill a lot of needs for a checker. We fulfill a lot of needs for a lot of different use cases. Few people look up at me and nod and Few people look up at me and nod and Few people look up at me and nod and give me a thumbs up when I can go give me a thumbs up when I can go give me a thumbs up when I can go on. Are we good? on. Are we good? on. Are we good? Okay. Okay. So, unfortunately, there are Okay. Okay. So, unfortunately, there are Okay. Okay. So, unfortunately, there are some trends to be aware of, but there some trends to be aware of, but there some trends to be aware of, but there are some good things on this slide. If are some good things on this slide. If are some good things on this slide. If you look on the left is an access you look on the left is an access you look on the left is an access measurement that shows how many CVEes measurement that shows how many CVEes measurement that shows how many CVEes came in and how many CVEes we processed. came in and how many CVEes we processed. came in and how many CVEes we processed. This goes back to the beginning of This goes back to the beginning of This goes back to the beginning of 2023. This is a little over two years 2023. This is a little over two years 2023. This is a little over two years worth of data. Okay. The orange lines worth of data. Okay. The orange lines worth of data. Okay. The orange lines are what we are what we are what we processed. As you can see from the processed. As you can see from the processed. As you can see from the beginning of 220 beginning of 220 beginning of 220 2023 till recently, we are doing better 2023 till recently, we are doing better 2023 till recently, we are doing better than we have than we have than we have before. Even with an all new team, we before. Even with an all new team, we before. Even with an all new team, we are doing better in the last few months are doing better in the last few months are doing better in the last few months where we've really hit our stride. And where we've really hit our stride. And where we've really hit our stride. And this is even with, you know, we've had this is even with, you know, we've had this is even with, you know, we've had somebody out on paternity leave. you somebody out on paternity leave. you somebody out on paternity leave. you know, we've had people take leave for know, we've had people take leave for know, we've had people take leave for vacation. We're still doing better. vacation. We're still doing better. vacation. We're still doing better. Okay. However, if you look at, you know, Okay. However, if you look at, you know, Okay. However, if you look at, you know, we had a pause for a few months where we had a pause for a few months where we had a pause for a few months where there was very little done and it took a there was very little done and it took a there was very little done and it took a couple months. You can see the numbers couple months. You can see the numbers couple months. You can see the numbers climbing where the new team came climbing where the new team came climbing where the new team came on, but you can see the blue line is the on, but you can see the blue line is the on, but you can see the blue line is the backlog. And so between our pause for backlog. And so between our pause for backlog. And so between our pause for several months last year and a 32% several months last year and a 32% several months last year and a 32% increase in how many CVEes came into us increase in how many CVEes came into us increase in how many CVEes came into us in 2024 compared to 2023. Unfortunately, in 2024 compared to 2023. Unfortunately, in 2024 compared to 2023. Unfortunately, there is backlog. Okay. So what are we going to backlog. Okay. So what are we going to backlog. Okay. So what are we going to do between now and the next Bong Kong? do between now and the next Bong Kong? do between now and the next Bong Kong? What am I going to be getting up here What am I going to be getting up here What am I going to be getting up here and talking about next year? So, one of the biggest things year? So, one of the biggest things year? So, one of the biggest things we're going to be doing in the next we're going to be doing in the next we're going to be doing in the next couple months, we are going to begin an couple months, we are going to begin an couple months, we are going to begin an overhaul of the CPE overhaul of the CPE overhaul of the CPE specifications. We've heard it several specifications. We've heard it several specifications. We've heard it several times here. We've heard it several times times here. We've heard it several times times here. We've heard it several times last year. The CPE specifications are last year. The CPE specifications are last year. The CPE specifications are woefully out of date. They are not woefully out of date. They are not woefully out of date. They are not realistic for how they are being used, realistic for how they are being used, realistic for how they are being used, and they are not realistic for how they and they are not realistic for how they and they are not realistic for how they need to be used. We're going to do this need to be used. We're going to do this need to be used. We're going to do this with a lot of outreach to this with a lot of outreach to this with a lot of outreach to this community. There's going to be a community. There's going to be a community. There's going to be a workshop. It's going to have a virtual workshop. It's going to have a virtual workshop. It's going to have a virtual component so that anybody can component so that anybody can component so that anybody can participate from participate from participate from anywhere. Sorry about time zone anywhere. Sorry about time zone anywhere. Sorry about time zone problems. I can't do anything about problems. I can't do anything about problems. I can't do anything about those, but we can do something about if those, but we can do something about if those, but we can do something about if you are in Seattle and you can't make it you are in Seattle and you can't make it you are in Seattle and you can't make it to Gathersburg. We get it. So, we're to Gathersburg. We get it. So, we're to Gathersburg. We get it. So, we're going to have this as available as going to have this as available as going to have this as available as possible and we're going to do a lot of possible and we're going to do a lot of possible and we're going to do a lot of outreach and trying to get the best outreach and trying to get the best outreach and trying to get the best amount of consensus on what should be amount of consensus on what should be amount of consensus on what should be going into these new specifications as going into these new specifications as going into these new specifications as possible. We're not going to be able to possible. We're not going to be able to possible. We're not going to be able to please everybody. There are people who please everybody. There are people who please everybody. There are people who are going to hate the CPE specifications are going to hate the CPE specifications are going to hate the CPE specifications no matter what we put out. There are no matter what we put out. There are no matter what we put out. There are people who are going to say, "Oh my god, people who are going to say, "Oh my god, people who are going to say, "Oh my god, you made this change and that's the you made this change and that's the you made this change and that's the change I've been wanting for 10 years. change I've been wanting for 10 years. change I've been wanting for 10 years. you know, so it's going to be a little you know, so it's going to be a little you know, so it's going to be a little bit all over the map, bit all over the map, bit all over the map, but these are, you know, this is this is but these are, you know, this is this is but these are, you know, this is this is some of the most used specifications out some of the most used specifications out some of the most used specifications out there, and we need to make them better. there, and we need to make them better. there, and we need to make them better. We need to update them. We need to make We need to update them. We need to make We need to update them. We need to make them better. So, this is a major project them better. So, this is a major project them better. So, this is a major project for us starting this year. For the time being, as soon as year. For the time being, as soon as year. For the time being, as soon as technically feasible, we've got to make technically feasible, we've got to make technically feasible, we've got to make some back-end changes. we are going to some back-end changes. we are going to some back-end changes. we are going to move to gap filling temporarily to help move to gap filling temporarily to help move to gap filling temporarily to help speed through the backlog. What this speed through the backlog. What this speed through the backlog. What this means is if we have things in our means is if we have things in our means is if we have things in our backlog that the CNA has a CVSS score or backlog that the CNA has a CVSS score or backlog that the CNA has a CVSS score or the CNA has a CWE score value, we are the CNA has a CWE score value, we are the CNA has a CWE score value, we are going to not create our own and we are going to not create our own and we are going to not create our own and we are going to go ahead and gap fill whatever going to go ahead and gap fill whatever going to go ahead and gap fill whatever is missing and let them go through the is missing and let them go through the is missing and let them go through the system. system. system. Now, this is a temporary thing, but we Now, this is a temporary thing, but we Now, this is a temporary thing, but we hope this gets us through the backlog hope this gets us through the backlog hope this gets us through the backlog even faster. We're going to be overhauling faster. We're going to be overhauling faster. We're going to be overhauling our internal CPE console similar to we our internal CPE console similar to we our internal CPE console similar to we did our internal Vong console. This is did our internal Vong console. This is did our internal Vong console. This is going to get us even faster, even more going to get us even faster, even more going to get us even faster, even more efficiency for the enrichment team. And efficiency for the enrichment team. And efficiency for the enrichment team. And when we do this, it is going to give us when we do this, it is going to give us when we do this, it is going to give us something that is going to allow us something that is going to allow us something that is going to allow us hopefully later this year to put out an hopefully later this year to put out an hopefully later this year to put out an externally facing CPE console. The goal externally facing CPE console. The goal externally facing CPE console. The goal is to work with is to work with is to work with organizations so that using the external organizations so that using the external organizations so that using the external console, the goal is that they would be console, the goal is that they would be console, the goal is that they would be able to manage their own CPEs in the CPE able to manage their own CPEs in the CPE able to manage their own CPEs in the CPE dictionary in the future. dictionary in the future. dictionary in the future. Okay, can't tell you a timeline on that Okay, can't tell you a timeline on that Okay, can't tell you a timeline on that part of it, but that is the eventual goal. We are also going to update and goal. We are also going to update and goal. We are also going to update and refresh our uh web refresh our uh web refresh our uh web content. So, that will be coming later content. So, that will be coming later content. So, that will be coming later this year. Um, we are working on a proof of concept Um, we are working on a proof of concept Um, we are working on a proof of concept tool that will hopefully be the tool that will hopefully be the tool that will hopefully be the beginning of automating enrichment for beginning of automating enrichment for beginning of automating enrichment for Linux kernel CVEEs. We think we're going Linux kernel CVEEs. We think we're going Linux kernel CVEEs. We think we're going to have a lot of success with this. to have a lot of success with this. to have a lot of success with this. We also have a team within NIST that's We also have a team within NIST that's We also have a team within NIST that's going to lead the charge on looking at going to lead the charge on looking at going to lead the charge on looking at what AI and machine learning can do to what AI and machine learning can do to what AI and machine learning can do to improve our enrichment process and make improve our enrichment process and make improve our enrichment process and make it faster and um you know just easier to it faster and um you know just easier to it faster and um you know just easier to get through. All right, here's the fun part. Questions. All right, folks in the room, Questions. All right, folks in the room, Questions. All right, folks in the room, please get queued up. We have several please get queued up. We have several please get queued up. We have several questions on discord as well. So we'll questions on discord as well. So we'll questions on discord as well. So we'll try to alternate between IRL and discord try to alternate between IRL and discord try to alternate between IRL and discord to get everyone addressed in our time. to get everyone addressed in our time. to get everyone addressed in our time. Take it away sir. Uh yeah so I'll try to Take it away sir. Uh yeah so I'll try to Take it away sir. Uh yeah so I'll try to be very brief uh and tur but basically be very brief uh and tur but basically be very brief uh and tur but basically why is NVD not an why is NVD not an why is NVD not an ADP? Why do we have two sources for data ADP? Why do we have two sources for data ADP? Why do we have two sources for data that we have to go get all the that we have to go get all the that we have to go get all the vulnerability data and then we have to vulnerability data and then we have to vulnerability data and then we have to wait for NVD to pick up new ADPs and wait for NVD to pick up new ADPs and wait for NVD to pick up new ADPs and vice versa. And why are there two? vice versa. And why are there two? vice versa. And why are there two? Well, it's a good question. We've talked Well, it's a good question. We've talked Well, it's a good question. We've talked about this internally a lot. I mean, the about this internally a lot. I mean, the about this internally a lot. I mean, the real answer right now is just history. real answer right now is just history. real answer right now is just history. This is how the system was initially This is how the system was initially This is how the system was initially established going back. And we've talked established going back. And we've talked established going back. And we've talked both with DHS and CISA and and both with DHS and CISA and and both with DHS and CISA and and internally about how do internally about how do internally about how do we make one data source or data set we make one data source or data set we make one data source or data set going forward. Um there are some going forward. Um there are some going forward. Um there are some strategic and operational and governance strategic and operational and governance strategic and operational and governance and business issues that we need to and business issues that we need to and business issues that we need to harmonize on. So it's less about the harmonize on. So it's less about the harmonize on. So it's less about the data issue and more around operations data issue and more around operations data issue and more around operations and business and business and business and business and business and business um issues that each of these databases um issues that each of these databases um issues that each of these databases serve to ensure that we are covering serve to ensure that we are covering serve to ensure that we are covering both of those sets of stakeholders both of those sets of stakeholders both of those sets of stakeholders um going forward. um meeting the um going forward. um meeting the um going forward. um meeting the requirements that both of these data requirements that both of these data requirements that both of these data sets um are intended to cover. So we sets um are intended to cover. So we sets um are intended to cover. So we agree it is a pain to have two different agree it is a pain to have two different agree it is a pain to have two different data sets with an overlapping data sets with an overlapping data sets with an overlapping um you know schemas and overlapping um you know schemas and overlapping um you know schemas and overlapping data. Um and we've kind of looked at and data. Um and we've kind of looked at and data. Um and we've kind of looked at and outlined some of what are the initial outlined some of what are the initial outlined some of what are the initial issues that need to be discussed issues that need to be discussed issues that need to be discussed overcome I mean even things like overcome I mean even things like overcome I mean even things like governance um as going forward as well. governance um as going forward as well. governance um as going forward as well. So yeah, we know we're not really So yeah, we know we're not really So yeah, we know we're not really servicing the end user well through servicing the end user well through servicing the end user well through this. Um we would like to overcome some this. Um we would like to overcome some this. Um we would like to overcome some of these issues going forward. Um it's of these issues going forward. Um it's of these issues going forward. Um it's one of the things we're going to be one of the things we're going to be one of the things we're going to be looking at in the future. Um but there looking at in the future. Um but there looking at in the future. Um but there it it's not as easy as just flipping a it it's not as easy as just flipping a it it's not as easy as just flipping a switch in data integration. I think switch in data integration. I think switch in data integration. I think there there's business layer issues that there there's business layer issues that there there's business layer issues that that we need to address. So long answer that we need to address. So long answer that we need to address. So long answer for yeah uh we would love to do it and for yeah uh we would love to do it and for yeah uh we would love to do it and there's things we need to overcome in there's things we need to overcome in there's things we need to overcome in order to get there. Question. All right. order to get there. Question. All right. order to get there. Question. All right. And and just to add to that, like it And and just to add to that, like it And and just to add to that, like it seems a little weird that we have two seems a little weird that we have two seems a little weird that we have two government funded agencies creating web government funded agencies creating web government funded agencies creating web search features for the same data. So search features for the same data. So search features for the same data. So it's just a little strange. So it's just a little strange. So it's just a little strange. So again, if I may, Pete Aller from uh again, if I may, Pete Aller from uh again, if I may, Pete Aller from uh member of the CVE member of the CVE member of the CVE board the ADP and we've talked about board the ADP and we've talked about board the ADP and we've talked about them being coming ADP. As a board them being coming ADP. As a board them being coming ADP. As a board member, I strongly recommend against it. member, I strongly recommend against it. member, I strongly recommend against it. And the reason I do is because the data And the reason I do is because the data And the reason I do is because the data set is not set is not set is not current and it needs to be more open. So current and it needs to be more open. So current and it needs to be more open. So that's a discussion point that for us to that's a discussion point that for us to that's a discussion point that for us to accept it as an ADP, we need to look at accept it as an ADP, we need to look at accept it as an ADP, we need to look at and then when we look at the data, I and then when we look at the data, I and then when we look at the data, I would expect that we actually understand would expect that we actually understand would expect that we actually understand that the CNA is the authoritative that the CNA is the authoritative that the CNA is the authoritative source. And I get MVD enriching data, source. And I get MVD enriching data, source. And I get MVD enriching data, but we have to come to some degree about but we have to come to some degree about but we have to come to some degree about where that source of data is where that source of data is where that source of data is from and how that is portrayed and from and how that is portrayed and from and how that is portrayed and aggregated. So, I'm just stating what my aggregated. So, I'm just stating what my aggregated. So, I'm just stating what my position is and what I'm looking for is position is and what I'm looking for is position is and what I'm looking for is some real good assurance about that some real good assurance about that some real good assurance about that becoming more open and becoming more open and becoming more open and interactive and we stop confusing those interactive and we stop confusing those interactive and we stop confusing those who consume who consume who consume software. Concur those are the some of software. Concur those are the some of software. Concur those are the some of those governance issues that we need to those governance issues that we need to those governance issues that we need to discuss and figure out. Yeah, sure. Uh yeah, we do have a question sure. Uh yeah, we do have a question sure. Uh yeah, we do have a question from uh an attendee on Discord. Uh this from uh an attendee on Discord. Uh this from uh an attendee on Discord. Uh this is from Kent Lanfield. The question is, is from Kent Lanfield. The question is, is from Kent Lanfield. The question is, does NIST re-evaluate records that have does NIST re-evaluate records that have does NIST re-evaluate records that have CISA volrichment data included? Not currently. Not currently. Not currently. Hi K. And hi Kent. Hope you're doing Hi K. And hi Kent. Hope you're doing Hi K. And hi Kent. Hope you're doing well. well. well. Yeah, we are using CISA ADP data um and Yeah, we are using CISA ADP data um and Yeah, we are using CISA ADP data um and gap filling based on that. And you're gap filling based on that. And you're gap filling based on that. And you're going to see results of that starting going to see results of that starting going to see results of that starting towards the end of April going into May. towards the end of April going into May. towards the end of April going into May. We work on one month sprints for our We work on one month sprints for our We work on one month sprints for our enrichment efforts. And so, you know, enrichment efforts. And so, you know, enrichment efforts. And so, you know, we've started powering through the SISA we've started powering through the SISA we've started powering through the SISA ADP data. And you should start ADP data. And you should start ADP data. And you should start seeting a little faster because of that seeting a little faster because of that seeting a little faster because of that um towards the end of April going into um towards the end of April going into um towards the end of April going into May. Good day. Um, I'm Andrew. Up until last Good day. Um, I'm Andrew. Up until last Good day. Um, I'm Andrew. Up until last week, I was with Google's open source week, I was with Google's open source week, I was with Google's open source security team. Uh, we have had a security team. Uh, we have had a security team. Uh, we have had a a more recent relationship with the NBD. a more recent relationship with the NBD. a more recent relationship with the NBD. It's been lovely to be able to have It's been lovely to be able to have It's been lovely to be able to have that. I had gotten Google's internally that. I had gotten Google's internally that. I had gotten Google's internally hot to trot with the consortium because, hot to trot with the consortium because, hot to trot with the consortium because, you know, one of the expectations that you know, one of the expectations that you know, one of the expectations that was set at last year's Voncom was that was set at last year's Voncom was that was set at last year's Voncom was that that was going to be a thing, right? And that was going to be a thing, right? And that was going to be a thing, right? And then eventually we we learned that no, then eventually we we learned that no, then eventually we we learned that no, it's not going to be a thing, right? And it's not going to be a thing, right? And it's not going to be a thing, right? And my question is how can industry provide my question is how can industry provide my question is how can industry provide input to the benefit of the NBD into input to the benefit of the NBD into input to the benefit of the NBD into best practices around um operations and best practices around um operations and best practices around um operations and processes and whatnot. Uh like we were processes and whatnot. Uh like we were processes and whatnot. Uh like we were hoping to be able to do that via the hoping to be able to do that via the hoping to be able to do that via the consortium in ways that would be consortium in ways that would be consortium in ways that would be beneficial both in terms of uh beneficial both in terms of uh beneficial both in terms of uh efficiencies and outcomes. efficiencies and outcomes. efficiencies and outcomes. It sounds like the consortium is no It sounds like the consortium is no It sounds like the consortium is no longer going to be a thing. So yeah, longer going to be a thing. So yeah, longer going to be a thing. So yeah, will there be formal ways to be able to will there be formal ways to be able to will there be formal ways to be able to provide that? There'll be both provide that? There'll be both provide that? There'll be both formal and I'm not going to say formal and I'm not going to say formal and I'm not going to say informal, but formal and less formal. So informal, but formal and less formal. So informal, but formal and less formal. So Tanya had talked about uh the upcoming Tanya had talked about uh the upcoming Tanya had talked about uh the upcoming conference and workshop which will have conference and workshop which will have conference and workshop which will have a a a pre-all then the conference which will pre-all then the conference which will pre-all then the conference which will be open to have these types of be open to have these types of be open to have these types of discussions as a more formal um discussions as a more formal um discussions as a more formal um mechanism. Um you can also and many mechanism. Um you can also and many mechanism. Um you can also and many do individually reach out and we can set do individually reach out and we can set do individually reach out and we can set up discussions and meetings both as uh up discussions and meetings both as uh up discussions and meetings both as uh individuals as your own industry individuals as your own industry individuals as your own industry consorcia and then also through those uh consorcia and then also through those uh consorcia and then also through those uh workshops. Those discussions though that workshops. Those discussions though that workshops. Those discussions though that we will be having um just so um you know we will be having um just so um you know we will be having um just so um you know you're aware about those discussions um you're aware about those discussions um you're aware about those discussions um we we pretty much have them in a very we we pretty much have them in a very we we pretty much have them in a very but we try to be open and um you know we but we try to be open and um you know we but we try to be open and um you know we use the word transparent mechanism. So use the word transparent mechanism. So use the word transparent mechanism. So um if you come to us and talk to us um if you come to us and talk to us um if you come to us and talk to us one-on-one which we encourage and many one-on-one which we encourage and many one-on-one which we encourage and many people do um those discussions we will people do um those discussions we will people do um those discussions we will also um as needed reflect out this is also um as needed reflect out this is also um as needed reflect out this is what we've heard this is what we've what we've heard this is what we've what we've heard this is what we've heard from so that we can show changes heard from so that we can show changes heard from so that we can show changes that we've made and the source that we've made and the source that we've made and the source requirements that we have generated for requirements that we have generated for requirements that we have generated for those changes. So formally it will be those changes. So formally it will be those changes. So formally it will be through call for participation in the through call for participation in the through call for participation in the conferences and workshops at the conferences and workshops at the conferences and workshops at the conferences and workshops. Uh and then conferences and workshops. Uh and then conferences and workshops. Uh and then as we close those out through closing as we close those out through closing as we close those out through closing reports um less formally absolutely we reports um less formally absolutely we reports um less formally absolutely we can do one-on-one discussions and can do one-on-one discussions and can do one-on-one discussions and engagements um uh but with a caveat that engagements um uh but with a caveat that engagements um uh but with a caveat that those discussions will will also those discussions will will also those discussions will will also potentially uh be reflected out in in potentially uh be reflected out in in potentially uh be reflected out in in public as well. So we'll have the last public as well. So we'll have the last public as well. So we'll have the last question right here. Everybody that's question right here. Everybody that's question right here. Everybody that's been in Discord, we're going to get all been in Discord, we're going to get all been in Discord, we're going to get all that information piped over to Chris and that information piped over to Chris and that information piped over to Chris and the NVD team. So, they'll get addressed the NVD team. So, they'll get addressed the NVD team. So, they'll get addressed and we'll put it back into Discord in and we'll put it back into Discord in and we'll put it back into Discord in the near future. Go ahead. Last the near future. Go ahead. Last the near future. Go ahead. Last question, sir. So, um FA is Oracle. We question, sir. So, um FA is Oracle. We question, sir. So, um FA is Oracle. We plan to put the CP into CV record. So, plan to put the CP into CV record. So, plan to put the CP into CV record. So, our question here is we already CP or our question here is we already CP or our question here is we already CP or will they make any modification on our will they make any modification on our will they make any modification on our submissions? when we take Oracle CPE submissions? when we take Oracle CPE submissions? when we take Oracle CPE submissions. submissions. submissions. Um, so we are planning on using CPE Um, so we are planning on using CPE Um, so we are planning on using CPE uh inputs through the external CPE uh inputs through the external CPE uh inputs through the external CPE console that we're going to be putting console that we're going to be putting console that we're going to be putting together later this year. And it will be together later this year. And it will be together later this year. And it will be one-on-one with organizations to, you one-on-one with organizations to, you one-on-one with organizations to, you know, we have to set up two-factor know, we have to set up two-factor know, we have to set up two-factor authentication for those people feeding authentication for those people feeding authentication for those people feeding into the console and these kinds of into the console and these kinds of into the console and these kinds of things. Um but we will be opening it up things. Um but we will be opening it up things. Um but we will be opening it up to you know basically CNAs. Um so Oracle to you know basically CNAs. Um so Oracle to you know basically CNAs. Um so Oracle could be one of those. It's it's not could be one of those. It's it's not could be one of those. It's it's not limited to any particular company. limited to any particular company. limited to any particular company. Before the council writing we submit a Before the council writing we submit a Before the council writing we submit a record in April with in the CVE record in April with in the CVE record in April with in the CVE record. So we will MVD create another CP record. So we will MVD create another CP record. So we will MVD create another CP string and put into the MVD page instead string and put into the MVD page instead string and put into the MVD page instead of using our submission in the CV of using our submission in the CV of using our submission in the CV record. This is a little more technical record. This is a little more technical record. This is a little more technical than I'm prepared to answer right now than I'm prepared to answer right now than I'm prepared to answer right now because it's it's going to take a longer because it's it's going to take a longer because it's it's going to take a longer answer. Chris Turner over there raised answer. Chris Turner over there raised answer. Chris Turner over there raised his hand. He's going to be the person his hand. He's going to be the person his hand. He's going to be the person you want to talk to. Okay. So here's a you want to talk to. Okay. So here's a you want to talk to. Okay. So here's a high level question. So we using the CVE high level question. So we using the CVE high level question. So we using the CVE JSON schema for C record and MVD has own JSON schema for C record and MVD has own JSON schema for C record and MVD has own schema. Can these two skip be merged schema. Can these two skip be merged schema. Can these two skip be merged because we have to pass two different because we have to pass two different because we have to pass two different kind of kind of kind of record through two passers? We will be record through two passers? We will be record through two passers? We will be looking at that. Okay. So Tanya and Matt, thank you for Okay. So Tanya and Matt, thank you for Okay. So Tanya and Matt, thank you for coming and giving us an update. We will coming and giving us an update. We will coming and giving us an update. We will get the questions in Discord addressed. get the questions in Discord addressed. get the questions in Discord addressed. So, please, if you have more, type them So, please, if you have more, type them So, please, if you have more, type them into Discord. We'll get them over to into Discord. We'll get them over to into Discord. We'll get them over to Chris. So, let's give Tanya and Matt a Chris. So, let's give Tanya and Matt a Chris. So, let's give Tanya and Matt a round of applause. Thank you for coming.
