Kind: captions Language: en Thanks for coming Thanks for coming Thanks for coming everybody. So the key takeaways really everybody. So the key takeaways really everybody. So the key takeaways really that um I want to get across I think we that um I want to get across I think we that um I want to get across I think we collectively want to get across is that collectively want to get across is that collectively want to get across is that root cause mapping is important. It's root cause mapping is important. It's root cause mapping is important. It's important for uh internal use. It's important for uh internal use. It's important for uh internal use. It's important for disclosure. Uh it's important for disclosure. Uh it's important for disclosure. Uh it's important for vulnerability management. important for vulnerability management. important for vulnerability management. Um, one of the other things that we've Um, one of the other things that we've Um, one of the other things that we've seen in a lot of the analysis that we've seen in a lot of the analysis that we've seen in a lot of the analysis that we've done over the years manually as well as done over the years manually as well as done over the years manually as well as technically now with um, AI driven technically now with um, AI driven technically now with um, AI driven capabilities is that the data input capabilities is that the data input capabilities is that the data input really matters right and I think that's really matters right and I think that's really matters right and I think that's obvious in some sense but it becomes obvious in some sense but it becomes obvious in some sense but it becomes more real as you start to work with more real as you start to work with more real as you start to work with these things. these things. these things. The other thing that uh we recognize and The other thing that uh we recognize and The other thing that uh we recognize and I know I talked about at this last year I know I talked about at this last year I know I talked about at this last year actually not on this stage I think it actually not on this stage I think it actually not on this stage I think it was in another room uh is the challenge was in another room uh is the challenge was in another room uh is the challenge of root cause mapping right it's hard of root cause mapping right it's hard of root cause mapping right it's hard it's not an easy thing it's not an easy thing it's not an easy thing um but we've seen over the last year um but we've seen over the last year um but we've seen over the last year since Voncon 2024 since Voncon 2024 since Voncon 2024 um community collaboration uh has really um community collaboration uh has really um community collaboration uh has really done a lot of improvements in the sense done a lot of improvements in the sense done a lot of improvements in the sense that we have good and improved guidance that we have good and improved guidance that we have good and improved guidance to the community about how to do it to the community about how to do it to the community about how to do it better got some capabilities we've better got some capabilities we've better got some capabilities we've improvements in usability and improvements in usability and improvements in usability and understandability in some levels within understandability in some levels within understandability in some levels within aspects of the CWE program itself. Um, aspects of the CWE program itself. Um, aspects of the CWE program itself. Um, and we've also through community and we've also through community and we've also through community collaboration, which we're going to be collaboration, which we're going to be collaboration, which we're going to be talking about today, um, seen the talking about today, um, seen the talking about today, um, seen the development of some AIdriven mapping development of some AIdriven mapping development of some AIdriven mapping capabilities. And lastly, uh most capabilities. And lastly, uh most capabilities. And lastly, uh most importantly, um LLMs, importantly, um LLMs, importantly, um LLMs, uh especially those that are grounded uh especially those that are grounded uh especially those that are grounded and trained, which we'll talk about, are and trained, which we'll talk about, are and trained, which we'll talk about, are good enough and cheap enough, uh to be good enough and cheap enough, uh to be good enough and cheap enough, uh to be used for root cause mapping and CVE used for root cause mapping and CVE used for root cause mapping and CVE enrichment in an interactive um or enrichment in an interactive um or enrichment in an interactive um or bulk uh supervised manner with a bulk uh supervised manner with a bulk uh supervised manner with a uh sufficiently um experienced SME. So uh sufficiently um experienced SME. So uh sufficiently um experienced SME. So just as a background and this is a a just as a background and this is a a just as a background and this is a a little bit of stuff that maybe just a little bit of stuff that maybe just a little bit of stuff that maybe just a level set but a lot may already have level set but a lot may already have level set but a lot may already have heard before. Root cause mapping in our heard before. Root cause mapping in our heard before. Root cause mapping in our context of our talk is really the context of our talk is really the context of our talk is really the identifying identifying identifying uh of the underlying cause of a uh of the underlying cause of a uh of the underlying cause of a vulnerability. And the way that we're vulnerability. And the way that we're vulnerability. And the way that we're talking about that today is by talking about that today is by talking about that today is by correlating a CVE record or a correlating a CVE record or a correlating a CVE record or a vulnerability an inst a a individual vulnerability an inst a a individual vulnerability an inst a a individual vulnerability unique with its vulnerability unique with its vulnerability unique with its accompanying root causes in the form of accompanying root causes in the form of accompanying root causes in the form of a C.WE we identifier or CWE a C.WE we identifier or CWE a C.WE we identifier or CWE identifiers. Um, and really what we identifiers. Um, and really what we identifiers. Um, and really what we think is that the intersection of these think is that the intersection of these think is that the intersection of these programs can really result in meaningful programs can really result in meaningful programs can really result in meaningful improvements across product security uh improvements across product security uh improvements across product security uh both within the community and within both within the community and within both within the community and within individual individual individual organizations. So what is value about organizations. So what is value about organizations. So what is value about root cause massing excuse me root cause root cause massing excuse me root cause root cause massing excuse me root cause mapping? It enables trend analysis and mapping? It enables trend analysis and mapping? It enables trend analysis and greater visibility into the patterns uh greater visibility into the patterns uh greater visibility into the patterns uh of vulnerabilities over time. uh it can of vulnerabilities over time. uh it can of vulnerabilities over time. uh it can illuminate where investments, policy and illuminate where investments, policy and illuminate where investments, policy and practices can address weaknesses practices can address weaknesses practices can address weaknesses responsible for product vulnerabilities responsible for product vulnerabilities responsible for product vulnerabilities uh so that they can be eliminated or uh so that they can be eliminated or uh so that they can be eliminated or avoided so they aren't manifest in the avoided so they aren't manifest in the avoided so they aren't manifest in the first place. So it provides further first place. So it provides further first place. So it provides further insight to potential exploitability as insight to potential exploitability as insight to potential exploitability as well when we know certain kinds of well when we know certain kinds of well when we know certain kinds of weaknesses are targeted by certain weaknesses are targeted by certain weaknesses are targeted by certain adversaries and those with certain adversaries and those with certain adversaries and those with certain capabilities. And it provides capabilities. And it provides capabilities. And it provides significantly a valuable feedback loop significantly a valuable feedback loop significantly a valuable feedback loop into an SDLC or into an architecture into an SDLC or into an architecture into an SDLC or into an architecture design planning timeline. Um where we design planning timeline. Um where we design planning timeline. Um where we know that things get much more expensive know that things get much more expensive know that things get much more expensive when we remediate things later. We know when we remediate things later. We know when we remediate things later. We know mistakes mistakes mistakes occur when we react to a vulnerability occur when we react to a vulnerability occur when we react to a vulnerability and we understand what caused it in the and we understand what caused it in the and we understand what caused it in the first place. Let's sort of incorporate first place. Let's sort of incorporate first place. Let's sort of incorporate that into our process earlier on so we that into our process earlier on so we that into our process earlier on so we don't repeat those kinds of things. And don't repeat those kinds of things. And don't repeat those kinds of things. And that's really enabled by doing effective that's really enabled by doing effective that's really enabled by doing effective root cause mapping and disclosure. And root cause mapping and disclosure. And root cause mapping and disclosure. And the other thing about this is for the the other thing about this is for the the other thing about this is for the most part with the exception of the last most part with the exception of the last most part with the exception of the last one, the first three bullets are really one, the first three bullets are really one, the first three bullets are really true for an individual organization in true for an individual organization in true for an individual organization in their own purposes uh but also true for their own purposes uh but also true for their own purposes uh but also true for the broader community. So we can draw the broader community. So we can draw the broader community. So we can draw some trend analyses across the community some trend analyses across the community some trend analyses across the community and really move the needle here. But and really move the needle here. But and really move the needle here. But it's a challenge. Um root cause mapping it's a challenge. Um root cause mapping it's a challenge. Um root cause mapping has a is a multifaceted problem. It's a has a is a multifaceted problem. It's a has a is a multifaceted problem. It's a different way of thinking. A lot of different way of thinking. A lot of different way of thinking. A lot of thinking in the cyber security community thinking in the cyber security community thinking in the cyber security community is really uh leaning toward historically is really uh leaning toward historically is really uh leaning toward historically over the vulnerability language or the over the vulnerability language or the over the vulnerability language or the attack language or the exploitation or attack language or the exploitation or attack language or the exploitation or the impact of this vulnerability, not so the impact of this vulnerability, not so the impact of this vulnerability, not so much what the actual mistake was that much what the actual mistake was that much what the actual mistake was that caused it. Uh it's also technically caused it. Uh it's also technically caused it. Uh it's also technically difficult. It's timeconuming. Um and difficult. It's timeconuming. Um and difficult. It's timeconuming. Um and just to acknowledge historically from a just to acknowledge historically from a just to acknowledge historically from a consumer perspective um it was never consumer perspective um it was never consumer perspective um it was never really a primary demand outcome which is really a primary demand outcome which is really a primary demand outcome which is now changing. But it's important to now changing. But it's important to now changing. But it's important to acknowledge that when we talked about a acknowledge that when we talked about a acknowledge that when we talked about a record before, it was saying, okay, how record before, it was saying, okay, how record before, it was saying, okay, how severe is this? Is it relevant to me? severe is this? Is it relevant to me? severe is this? Is it relevant to me? What do I do about it? Not, well, what What do I do about it? Not, well, what What do I do about it? Not, well, what was the was the was the cause? The other thing is just to cause? The other thing is just to cause? The other thing is just to acknowledge and and by no means handwave acknowledge and and by no means handwave acknowledge and and by no means handwave is the idea that the C.WE repository is is the idea that the C.WE repository is is the idea that the C.WE repository is a vast body of knowledge that is a vast body of knowledge that is a vast body of knowledge that is technically detailed and densely technically detailed and densely technically detailed and densely presented and difficult to consume. Um presented and difficult to consume. Um presented and difficult to consume. Um we are making headway in terms of we are making headway in terms of we are making headway in terms of usability improvements at both the usability improvements at both the usability improvements at both the individual weakness level and sort of individual weakness level and sort of individual weakness level and sort of the larger scale macro I I kind of say the larger scale macro I I kind of say the larger scale macro I I kind of say scale. Um but it is difficult to scale. Um but it is difficult to scale. Um but it is difficult to understand by the lay person. Um and understand by the lay person. Um and understand by the lay person. Um and what has happened over time since 20067 what has happened over time since 20067 what has happened over time since 20067 or so when it when it first came to be or so when it when it first came to be or so when it when it first came to be and today uh is we have a set of super and today uh is we have a set of super and today uh is we have a set of super users that exist of which there's a users that exist of which there's a users that exist of which there's a handful and some in the room that I can handful and some in the room that I can handful and some in the room that I can see and then everybody else. see and then everybody else. see and then everybody else. Uh I talked a little bit about this Uh I talked a little bit about this Uh I talked a little bit about this already. We've started to make some already. We've started to make some already. We've started to make some headway and improvement in usability in headway and improvement in usability in headway and improvement in usability in CWE. Um we have demonstrable evidence CWE. Um we have demonstrable evidence CWE. Um we have demonstrable evidence for a decentralized approach in root for a decentralized approach in root for a decentralized approach in root cause mapping throughout the ecosystem, cause mapping throughout the ecosystem, cause mapping throughout the ecosystem, which I'm actually going to be talking which I'm actually going to be talking which I'm actually going to be talking about a little bit later on this stage about a little bit later on this stage about a little bit later on this stage today. Um in that we're seeing a lot of today. Um in that we're seeing a lot of today. Um in that we're seeing a lot of CNAs take on the challenge of root cause CNAs take on the challenge of root cause CNAs take on the challenge of root cause mapping and reporting CWs as part of mapping and reporting CWs as part of mapping and reporting CWs as part of their routine vulnerability disclosure their routine vulnerability disclosure their routine vulnerability disclosure practices. Um, and also we have a root practices. Um, and also we have a root practices. Um, and also we have a root cause mapping working group which is cause mapping working group which is cause mapping working group which is really how this uh whole talk is really how this uh whole talk is really how this uh whole talk is happening and and I can't wait to hand happening and and I can't wait to hand happening and and I can't wait to hand it over to Chris uh in a moment to talk it over to Chris uh in a moment to talk it over to Chris uh in a moment to talk about some of that work. So we're seeing about some of that work. So we're seeing about some of that work. So we're seeing broad adoption of root cause mapping as broad adoption of root cause mapping as broad adoption of root cause mapping as I said as part of the vulnerability I said as part of the vulnerability I said as part of the vulnerability disclosure across the majority of CNAs. disclosure across the majority of CNAs. disclosure across the majority of CNAs. Um again little pitch to my talk after Um again little pitch to my talk after Um again little pitch to my talk after lunch. Um we have root cause mapping lunch. Um we have root cause mapping lunch. Um we have root cause mapping guidance on the C.WE site. We have guidance on the C.WE site. We have guidance on the C.WE site. We have mapping labels and notes um that help on mapping labels and notes um that help on mapping labels and notes um that help on every single entry uh for better every single entry uh for better every single entry uh for better understanding and mapping. Um, but it's understanding and mapping. Um, but it's understanding and mapping. Um, but it's still challenging to navigate and that's still challenging to navigate and that's still challenging to navigate and that's important. Um, traditional search only important. Um, traditional search only important. Um, traditional search only goes so far and there's really an goes so far and there's really an goes so far and there's really an opportunity that exists for the C.WE opportunity that exists for the C.WE opportunity that exists for the C.WE program to work with its researchers and program to work with its researchers and program to work with its researchers and and the community um to enable a greater and the community um to enable a greater and the community um to enable a greater interactivity capability um to advance interactivity capability um to advance interactivity capability um to advance uh faster and more precise root cause uh faster and more precise root cause uh faster and more precise root cause mapping. And so what we've been thinking mapping. And so what we've been thinking mapping. And so what we've been thinking about uh in addition to things like about uh in addition to things like about uh in addition to things like guidance and education and engagement guidance and education and engagement guidance and education and engagement and and working group discussions is an and and working group discussions is an and and working group discussions is an idea of the advancements in AIdriven idea of the advancements in AIdriven idea of the advancements in AIdriven capabilities enabling the consumption capabilities enabling the consumption capabilities enabling the consumption and interactivity with the CWE corpus in and interactivity with the CWE corpus in and interactivity with the CWE corpus in a way that is far more valuable than a way that is far more valuable than a way that is far more valuable than traditional search. And there's traditional search. And there's traditional search. And there's different uses for this, right? different uses for this, right? different uses for this, right? Hopefully you can see these things Hopefully you can see these things Hopefully you can see these things pretty it's pretty large. Coloring is a pretty it's pretty large. Coloring is a pretty it's pretty large. Coloring is a little uh tough sometimes. But we've got little uh tough sometimes. But we've got little uh tough sometimes. But we've got PERTS, we've got developers, academic PERTS, we've got developers, academic PERTS, we've got developers, academic researchers, bug bounty hunters, product researchers, bug bounty hunters, product researchers, bug bounty hunters, product managers. Sometimes people are creating managers. Sometimes people are creating managers. Sometimes people are creating a CVE record. Sometimes people are just a CVE record. Sometimes people are just a CVE record. Sometimes people are just trying to better understand and do trying to better understand and do trying to better understand and do analysis. Um really the key point there analysis. Um really the key point there analysis. Um really the key point there is down there in the blue. Uh is down there in the blue. Uh is down there in the blue. Uh advancements in LLM technologies we've advancements in LLM technologies we've advancements in LLM technologies we've all seen and heard endlessly about um all seen and heard endlessly about um all seen and heard endlessly about um really do make it possible. we posit uh really do make it possible. we posit uh really do make it possible. we posit uh to interact with CWE information as to interact with CWE information as to interact with CWE information as opposed to simply browsing it or opposed to simply browsing it or opposed to simply browsing it or searching it in a more traditional searching it in a more traditional searching it in a more traditional manner. And that's what we're going to manner. And that's what we're going to manner. And that's what we're going to talk about. So I'm going to hand it over talk about. So I'm going to hand it over talk about. So I'm going to hand it over to my friend Chris Madden. Over to you, to my friend Chris Madden. Over to you, to my friend Chris Madden. Over to you, sir. Super. Thank you, sir. Super. Thank you, sir. Super. Thank you, Alec. So I'm here because I wanted to Alec. So I'm here because I wanted to Alec. So I'm here because I wanted to use use use CWEs. I wanted to use CWEs to identify CWEs. I wanted to use CWEs to identify CWEs. I wanted to use CWEs to identify classes vulnerabilities so that they classes vulnerabilities so that they classes vulnerabilities so that they could be eradicated. could be eradicated. could be eradicated. And so when I started doing that, I And so when I started doing that, I And so when I started doing that, I noticed there was some quality issues. I noticed there was some quality issues. I noticed there was some quality issues. I thought I should do something about thought I should do something about thought I should do something about that. And I was learning and playing that. And I was learning and playing that. And I was learning and playing with LLMs at the same with LLMs at the same with LLMs at the same time. And that started by creating some time. And that started by creating some time. And that started by creating some GitHub issues against the Caesar GitHub issues against the Caesar GitHub issues against the Caesar vulnerrichment, correcting some of the vulnerrichment, correcting some of the vulnerrichment, correcting some of the CWEs that they had assigned. And on the CWEs that they had assigned. And on the CWEs that they had assigned. And on the back of that, then they suggested I talk back of that, then they suggested I talk back of that, then they suggested I talk to the, as I call them, the CWE gods in to the, as I call them, the CWE gods in to the, as I call them, the CWE gods in the root cause mapping working group. I the root cause mapping working group. I the root cause mapping working group. I think that was them politely telling me think that was them politely telling me think that was them politely telling me to go away and bug somebody to go away and bug somebody to go away and bug somebody else. So I joined the root cause mapping else. So I joined the root cause mapping else. So I joined the root cause mapping working group and we've been working working group and we've been working working group and we've been working together on well what are the together on well what are the together on well what are the requirements for such an LLM tool and requirements for such an LLM tool and requirements for such an LLM tool and what should it do etc. And that's what what should it do etc. And that's what what should it do etc. And that's what we're going to talk through here today. we're going to talk through here today. we're going to talk through here today. So let's start by LLM versus grounded So let's start by LLM versus grounded So let's start by LLM versus grounded LLM. Um maybe if we use an analogy. So LLM. Um maybe if we use an analogy. So LLM. Um maybe if we use an analogy. So remember back in the day when you were remember back in the day when you were remember back in the day when you were doing exams and you got a question and doing exams and you got a question and doing exams and you got a question and you had absolutely no idea what the you had absolutely no idea what the you had absolutely no idea what the answer was. You probably didn't write answer was. You probably didn't write answer was. You probably didn't write down on the paper, I have absolutely no down on the paper, I have absolutely no down on the paper, I have absolutely no idea and I'm 100% confident that I have idea and I'm 100% confident that I have idea and I'm 100% confident that I have no idea about that. You probably did no idea about that. You probably did no idea about that. You probably did your best to give a coherent answer your best to give a coherent answer your best to give a coherent answer based on the question and whatever based on the question and whatever based on the question and whatever learning that you had. And that's the learning that you had. And that's the learning that you had. And that's the way LLMs work. They way LLMs work. They way LLMs work. They value coherence over accuracy. But using value coherence over accuracy. But using value coherence over accuracy. But using that analogy, um, think of the time when that analogy, um, think of the time when that analogy, um, think of the time when you were doing an open book exam and so you were doing an open book exam and so you were doing an open book exam and so you had all the books on your table and you had all the books on your table and you had all the books on your table and the challenge was to retrieve the the challenge was to retrieve the the challenge was to retrieve the relevant pages to get the information to relevant pages to get the information to relevant pages to get the information to answer the question so you could be both answer the question so you could be both answer the question so you could be both coherent and accurate. And that's really coherent and accurate. And that's really coherent and accurate. And that's really what grounding is about. If you provide what grounding is about. If you provide what grounding is about. If you provide the LLM with the information it needs to the LLM with the information it needs to the LLM with the information it needs to answer the question, it'll give back answer the question, it'll give back answer the question, it'll give back accurate answers. Okay, so let's look at the capabilities Okay, so let's look at the capabilities Okay, so let's look at the capabilities then in vulnerability root cause then in vulnerability root cause then in vulnerability root cause mapping. So it starts not with the CWE, mapping. So it starts not with the CWE, mapping. So it starts not with the CWE, it starts with the CVE info first. This it starts with the CVE info first. This it starts with the CVE info first. This is a key point. As Alex said, it's all is a key point. As Alex said, it's all is a key point. As Alex said, it's all about complete, accurate, and timely about complete, accurate, and timely about complete, accurate, and timely information. If you don't have that, information. If you don't have that, information. If you don't have that, then LLMs or people or anything else then LLMs or people or anything else then LLMs or people or anything else isn't going to solve your problem. It's isn't going to solve your problem. It's isn't going to solve your problem. It's a garbage in garbage out problem. So, we a garbage in garbage out problem. So, we a garbage in garbage out problem. So, we want to get good data as soon as want to get good data as soon as want to get good data as soon as possible, preferably at the point of possible, preferably at the point of possible, preferably at the point of entry. It's it really is that entry. It's it really is that entry. It's it really is that simple. So, we're going to step through simple. So, we're going to step through simple. So, we're going to step through some of the cases like creating some of the cases like creating some of the cases like creating descriptions, extracting key phrases, descriptions, extracting key phrases, descriptions, extracting key phrases, etc. right the way through. And this is etc. right the way through. And this is etc. right the way through. And this is about enriching the CVE info. So then we about enriching the CVE info. So then we about enriching the CVE info. So then we can do better C.WE assignment. Okay. I can do better C.WE assignment. Okay. I can do better C.WE assignment. Okay. I will talk a lot about LLMs, but as a will talk a lot about LLMs, but as a will talk a lot about LLMs, but as a hardcore techie, I always my frame of hardcore techie, I always my frame of hardcore techie, I always my frame of reference is that it's people over reference is that it's people over reference is that it's people over process over technology. Okay, I'm going process over technology. Okay, I'm going process over technology. Okay, I'm going to talk about the technology, but all to talk about the technology, but all to talk about the technology, but all that needs to exist in existing workflow that needs to exist in existing workflow that needs to exist in existing workflow as used by people. Okay, let's start a real people. Okay, let's start a real people. Okay, let's start a real example. um January 23 example. um January 23 example. um January 23 a CV was published and it's fair to say a CV was published and it's fair to say a CV was published and it's fair to say it was on the shorter side in terms of it was on the shorter side in terms of it was on the shorter side in terms of CV CV CV description mail spoofing. So I thought description mail spoofing. So I thought description mail spoofing. So I thought to myself, interesting proof of concept. to myself, interesting proof of concept. to myself, interesting proof of concept. Could I take that CVE and the advisory Could I take that CVE and the advisory Could I take that CVE and the advisory link in it, give it to an LLM and say, link in it, give it to an LLM and say, link in it, give it to an LLM and say, hey, given the link and the template hey, given the link and the template hey, given the link and the template from CVE, create a good CV description from CVE, create a good CV description from CVE, create a good CV description and removing the vendor name, this is and removing the vendor name, this is and removing the vendor name, this is what it what it what it produced. Several days later, um the CV produced. Several days later, um the CV produced. Several days later, um the CV was published. And you can see there's was published. And you can see there's was published. And you can see there's not a lot of difference um between the not a lot of difference um between the not a lot of difference um between the two. One was LLM generated, the other two. One was LLM generated, the other two. One was LLM generated, the other one's generated by a person presumably. one's generated by a person presumably. one's generated by a person presumably. Um, not a lot of difference. So, LLMs are pretty good at difference. So, LLMs are pretty good at difference. So, LLMs are pretty good at creating CV descriptions, giving the creating CV descriptions, giving the creating CV descriptions, giving the reference material, and as part of that, reference material, and as part of that, reference material, and as part of that, they can take the toil out of it. You they can take the toil out of it. You they can take the toil out of it. You know, if you have the description, it know, if you have the description, it know, if you have the description, it all comes down to having the all comes down to having the all comes down to having the information. If you have that, then LM information. If you have that, then LM information. If you have that, then LM can do a good job of creating can do a good job of creating can do a good job of creating descriptions. Another example, we can descriptions. Another example, we can descriptions. Another example, we can extract the key phrases from CV extract the key phrases from CV extract the key phrases from CV description. um maybe I want to know description. um maybe I want to know description. um maybe I want to know what the impact of a CVE is and I don't what the impact of a CVE is and I don't what the impact of a CVE is and I don't want to be reading through one or many want to be reading through one or many want to be reading through one or many CVEEs and I'd like to know what the CVEEs and I'd like to know what the CVEEs and I'd like to know what the impact is and moreover maybe I want to impact is and moreover maybe I want to impact is and moreover maybe I want to map that impact to one of the eight map that impact to one of the eight map that impact to one of the eight minor impacts so that I have a sort of minor impacts so that I have a sort of minor impacts so that I have a sort of taxonomy or classification of impact but taxonomy or classification of impact but taxonomy or classification of impact but also especially if I'm doing root cause also especially if I'm doing root cause also especially if I'm doing root cause mapping I really want to know what the mapping I really want to know what the mapping I really want to know what the root cause and the weakness is that's root cause and the weakness is that's root cause and the weakness is that's really helpful if I want to sign a CWE really helpful if I want to sign a CWE really helpful if I want to sign a CWE and a lot of solutions take the whole and a lot of solutions take the whole and a lot of solutions take the whole description and try to map to a CWE that description and try to map to a CWE that description and try to map to a CWE that way having the root cause and the way having the root cause and the way having the root cause and the weakness um make the mapping a whole lot weakness um make the mapping a whole lot weakness um make the mapping a whole lot easier and better. Taking that info, if we looked better. Taking that info, if we looked better. Taking that info, if we looked at all um CVS published to end of 2024 at all um CVS published to end of 2024 at all um CVS published to end of 2024 is about um is about um is about um 260K. We could look at how that breaks 260K. We could look at how that breaks 260K. We could look at how that breaks down in terms of if we use the count of down in terms of if we use the count of down in terms of if we use the count of those key phrases as a measure of those key phrases as a measure of those key phrases as a measure of quality. Um, we can see what that looks quality. Um, we can see what that looks quality. Um, we can see what that looks like. Um, we can also see that product like. Um, we can also see that product like. Um, we can also see that product is the top key phrase used and root is the top key phrase used and root is the top key phrase used and root cause and weakness is the least used. cause and weakness is the least used. cause and weakness is the least used. And looking at further data, what it And looking at further data, what it And looking at further data, what it shows is that shows is that shows is that typically if you have root cause, you typically if you have root cause, you typically if you have root cause, you don't have weakness. You get one or the don't have weakness. You get one or the don't have weakness. You get one or the other, but rarely or not often other, but rarely or not often other, but rarely or not often both. So again, useful if you wanted to both. So again, useful if you wanted to both. So again, useful if you wanted to improve the quality of the point of improve the quality of the point of improve the quality of the point of entry. um this could be a useful way to entry. um this could be a useful way to entry. um this could be a useful way to you know quantitatively measure that you know quantitatively measure that you know quantitatively measure that quality extracting out the key phrases reference content. So this is an phrases reference content. So this is an phrases reference content. So this is an example that came up in the root cause example that came up in the root cause example that came up in the root cause mapping working group. The description mapping working group. The description mapping working group. The description is wrong. It's not a command injection. is wrong. It's not a command injection. is wrong. It's not a command injection. Um the reference content simply has more Um the reference content simply has more Um the reference content simply has more information and it's usually more information and it's usually more information and it's usually more accurate. Um so in this case yeah we can accurate. Um so in this case yeah we can accurate. Um so in this case yeah we can extract that key phrases but what I also extract that key phrases but what I also extract that key phrases but what I also did was as part of root cause mapping is did was as part of root cause mapping is did was as part of root cause mapping is take the reference link content from the take the reference link content from the take the reference link content from the 260k published CVE to end 2024 and then 260k published CVE to end 2024 and then 260k published CVE to end 2024 and then summarize it to an LLM. So get the summarize it to an LLM. So get the summarize it to an LLM. So get the summary description type things like log summary description type things like log summary description type things like log for shell has about 100 links. I don't for shell has about 100 links. I don't for shell has about 100 links. I don't know if anyone's ever read all them but know if anyone's ever read all them but know if anyone's ever read all them but um it would be useful to have a summary um it would be useful to have a summary um it would be useful to have a summary of that in terms of uh both for people of that in terms of uh both for people of that in terms of uh both for people and for humans. So the task here is to assign humans. So the task here is to assign humans. So the task here is to assign CWEs to CVES and we're going to look at CWEs to CVES and we're going to look at CWEs to CVES and we're going to look at as Alex said the sort of chatbot version as Alex said the sort of chatbot version as Alex said the sort of chatbot version and we're going to go deep then into and we're going to go deep then into and we're going to go deep then into bulk assignment and we can learn a lot bulk assignment and we can learn a lot bulk assignment and we can learn a lot from the bulk assignment as a proof of concept. One of assignment as a proof of concept. One of assignment as a proof of concept. One of my first engagements with the root cause my first engagements with the root cause my first engagements with the root cause mapping group was to show a grounded um mapping group was to show a grounded um mapping group was to show a grounded um chatbot. And an example of that is if chatbot. And an example of that is if chatbot. And an example of that is if you ask the chatbot what is a dog, it you ask the chatbot what is a dog, it you ask the chatbot what is a dog, it says I don't know. The information is says I don't know. The information is says I don't know. The information is not there. So it only answers based on not there. So it only answers based on not there. So it only answers based on what it knows. And that what it knows is what it knows. And that what it knows is what it knows. And that what it knows is the CWE corpus. So you can build for the CWE corpus. So you can build for the CWE corpus. So you can build for yourself a CWE expert for free in less yourself a CWE expert for free in less yourself a CWE expert for free in less than one minute from your browser by than one minute from your browser by than one minute from your browser by following the instructions here. It following the instructions here. It following the instructions here. It works quite effective. There is a works quite effective. There is a works quite effective. There is a presentation later on the week on CW presentation later on the week on CW presentation later on the week on CW chatbots. So I won't steal their chatbots. So I won't steal their chatbots. So I won't steal their thunder, but if you do want to have your thunder, but if you do want to have your thunder, but if you do want to have your own uh own uh own uh expert, you can, as I said, build it expert, you can, as I said, build it expert, you can, as I said, build it quickly and for free. And you can do all sorts of things free. And you can do all sorts of things free. And you can do all sorts of things like that. You can ask it, hey, what's like that. You can ask it, hey, what's like that. You can ask it, hey, what's the best CWE for this vulnerability the best CWE for this vulnerability the best CWE for this vulnerability description? Tell me about the CWEs description? Tell me about the CWEs description? Tell me about the CWEs related to buffer overflow or whatever related to buffer overflow or whatever related to buffer overflow or whatever you want. The types of questions that you want. The types of questions that you want. The types of questions that you would ask an expert. you would ask an expert. you would ask an expert. Okay, so we've walked through Okay, so we've walked through Okay, so we've walked through the capabilities where LLMs can help and the capabilities where LLMs can help and the capabilities where LLMs can help and I want to emphasize again it's really I want to emphasize again it's really I want to emphasize again it's really about enriching the CVE info at the about enriching the CVE info at the about enriching the CVE info at the point of entry. If we don't have that point of entry. If we don't have that point of entry. If we don't have that then you know LLMs or anything else then you know LLMs or anything else then you know LLMs or anything else aren't going to be very useful for CWE aren't going to be very useful for CWE aren't going to be very useful for CWE mapping. Okay, so let's go deep then Okay, so let's go deep then Okay, so let's go deep then on CWE assignment. If you look through on CWE assignment. If you look through on CWE assignment. If you look through the research papers on CWE assignment, the research papers on CWE assignment, the research papers on CWE assignment, you'll see that a lot of folks you'll see that a lot of folks you'll see that a lot of folks concentrate on the middle bit, the concentrate on the middle bit, the concentrate on the middle bit, the mapping mapping mapping bit. They don't look at augmenting the bit. They don't look at augmenting the bit. They don't look at augmenting the vulnerability info. So traditionally vulnerability info. So traditionally vulnerability info. So traditionally classifiers, they take the existing classifiers, they take the existing classifiers, they take the existing mappings mappings mappings um and build a classification model on um and build a classification model on um and build a classification model on that and try to do clever things. That that and try to do clever things. That that and try to do clever things. That completely misses the point, I think. As a wise man once said, you can't use As a wise man once said, you can't use As a wise man once said, you can't use bad mappings to learn how to do good bad mappings to learn how to do good bad mappings to learn how to do good mappings. So instead, what we do is we mappings. So instead, what we do is we mappings. So instead, what we do is we look at the existing vulnerability info look at the existing vulnerability info look at the existing vulnerability info and CWE info and try and use as much of and CWE info and try and use as much of and CWE info and try and use as much of that as we can and then do clever things that as we can and then do clever things that as we can and then do clever things as well on the mapping. So what we do is as well on the mapping. So what we do is as well on the mapping. So what we do is um we do the enrichment of the CDE info um we do the enrichment of the CDE info um we do the enrichment of the CDE info um whether it's the key phrases the root um whether it's the key phrases the root um whether it's the key phrases the root cause and the weakness whether it's the cause and the weakness whether it's the cause and the weakness whether it's the summary of the reference summary of the reference summary of the reference content and also consensus uh CWE so content and also consensus uh CWE so content and also consensus uh CWE so about 15% of about 15% of about 15% of CVEes are similar in description as in CVEes are similar in description as in CVEes are similar in description as in their groups and the associated CWE their groups and the associated CWE their groups and the associated CWE there's generally consensus with that so there's generally consensus with that so there's generally consensus with that so that's some other useful info so we can that's some other useful info so we can that's some other useful info so we can take all that info And similarly on the take all that info And similarly on the take all that info And similarly on the output, we don't want a model that spits output, we don't want a model that spits output, we don't want a model that spits out an answer like 42. That's not very out an answer like 42. That's not very out an answer like 42. That's not very useful because you want to know, well, useful because you want to know, well, useful because you want to know, well, how did you arrive at 42? What's the how did you arrive at 42? What's the how did you arrive at 42? What's the rationale? And how confident are you in rationale? And how confident are you in rationale? And how confident are you in 42? That's especially important in the 42? That's especially important in the 42? That's especially important in the context of, you know, grounding and context of, you know, grounding and context of, you know, grounding and hallucinations. So you want a model that hallucinations. So you want a model that hallucinations. So you want a model that spits out a short list of candidates spits out a short list of candidates spits out a short list of candidates with confidence and with the rationale with confidence and with the rationale with confidence and with the rationale behind them. So as a human, uh, we can behind them. So as a human, uh, we can behind them. So as a human, uh, we can then review that list and then accept or then review that list and then accept or then review that list and then accept or refine the list. Okay, that's what we're refine the list. Okay, that's what we're refine the list. Okay, that's what we're looking for. That's what we agreed as looking for. That's what we agreed as looking for. That's what we agreed as the requirement. So in terms of data layers and it really So in terms of data layers and it really So in terms of data layers and it really comes down to this is all about data comes down to this is all about data comes down to this is all about data data enrichment. It all comes down to data enrichment. It all comes down to data enrichment. It all comes down to the data layers. So we have our CV info the data layers. So we have our CV info the data layers. So we have our CV info then we enrich it using LLMs to get the then we enrich it using LLMs to get the then we enrich it using LLMs to get the key phrases etc. And then the important key phrases etc. And then the important key phrases etc. And then the important bit is the retrieval. So going back to bit is the retrieval. So going back to bit is the retrieval. So going back to our open book exam um analogy the key our open book exam um analogy the key our open book exam um analogy the key part here is to retrieve the right pages part here is to retrieve the right pages part here is to retrieve the right pages from the books. All right. And if we from the books. All right. And if we from the books. All right. And if we have that, we can get a good answer from have that, we can get a good answer from have that, we can get a good answer from a human or an LLM. So LLMs, it's a human or an LLM. So LLMs, it's a human or an LLM. So LLMs, it's primarily about getting the right primarily about getting the right primarily about getting the right information into the LLM. Okay, it's the information into the LLM. Okay, it's the information into the LLM. Okay, it's the retrieval part. And then after that, you retrieval part. And then after that, you retrieval part. And then after that, you can use a powerful or a small LLM to can use a powerful or a small LLM to can use a powerful or a small LLM to assign CWEs. And then we have our CWE assign CWEs. And then we have our CWE assign CWEs. And then we have our CWE corpus as well, which in terms of order corpus as well, which in terms of order corpus as well, which in terms of order of magnitude, what we have is about a of magnitude, what we have is about a of magnitude, what we have is about a thousand CWEs. We want to go to a short thousand CWEs. We want to go to a short thousand CWEs. We want to go to a short list of around 10 candidates from our list of around 10 candidates from our list of around 10 candidates from our retriever and we want to go to retriever and we want to go to retriever and we want to go to approximately in order of magnitude one approximately in order of magnitude one approximately in order of magnitude one or two CWES okay assigned. Okay. So or two CWES okay assigned. Okay. So or two CWES okay assigned. Okay. So that's what we're trying to do and that's what we're trying to do and that's what we're trying to do and that's what the retrieval part does for that's what the retrieval part does for that's what the retrieval part does for us. As I said in terms of open book exam us. As I said in terms of open book exam us. As I said in terms of open book exam you're going from like a thousand pages you're going from like a thousand pages you're going from like a thousand pages to 10 pages that you can base your to 10 pages that you can base your to 10 pages that you can base your answer on. All right. So the retrieval answer on. All right. So the retrieval answer on. All right. So the retrieval bit is crucially important here. Also worth noting that CWE it's a here. Also worth noting that CWE it's a here. Also worth noting that CWE it's a graph. there are relationships child of graph. there are relationships child of graph. there are relationships child of parent of etc. Um if we find a relevant parent of etc. Um if we find a relevant parent of etc. Um if we find a relevant CWE we should look around at the CWE we should look around at the CWE we should look around at the children and the parents and figure out children and the parents and figure out children and the parents and figure out if they're related. Okay so we can use if they're related. Okay so we can use if they're related. Okay so we can use the graph as well. So we're going to use the graph as well. So we're going to use the graph as well. So we're going to use graph properties as well as part of our graph properties as well as part of our graph properties as well as part of our retrieval. So ultimately we end up with retrieval. So ultimately we end up with retrieval. So ultimately we end up with three types of retriever. We have sparse three types of retriever. We have sparse three types of retriever. We have sparse and you can think keyword search okay in and you can think keyword search okay in and you can think keyword search okay in simple terms things like simple terms things like simple terms things like BM25. BM25. BM25. Um but then there's also semantic Um but then there's also semantic Um but then there's also semantic search. So things like memory corruption search. So things like memory corruption search. So things like memory corruption and buffer overflow semantically very and buffer overflow semantically very and buffer overflow semantically very similar lexically quite different. So similar lexically quite different. So similar lexically quite different. So that's what semantic search or dense that's what semantic search or dense that's what semantic search or dense retriever does for us. And then this retriever does for us. And then this retriever does for us. And then this property graph said using the properties property graph said using the properties property graph said using the properties of the CWE graph for retrieval. And of the CWE graph for retrieval. And of the CWE graph for retrieval. And again emphasizing all we're trying to do again emphasizing all we're trying to do again emphasizing all we're trying to do here is go from a thousand CWE here is go from a thousand CWE here is go from a thousand CWE candidates down to a short list of 10 candidates down to a short list of 10 candidates down to a short list of 10 that we an LLM or a person can make that we an LLM or a person can make that we an LLM or a person can make assignments based on. So originally I had three LLMs, an So originally I had three LLMs, an So originally I had three LLMs, an analyzer, a critic and a resolver. And analyzer, a critic and a resolver. And analyzer, a critic and a resolver. And the analyzer was, you know, to do the the analyzer was, you know, to do the the analyzer was, you know, to do the original assignment and then the critic original assignment and then the critic original assignment and then the critic and the resolver were to review and and the resolver were to review and and the resolver were to review and assign. And what I found was that the assign. And what I found was that the assign. And what I found was that the analyzer output was good enough that I analyzer output was good enough that I analyzer output was good enough that I didn't need the critic and the resolver. didn't need the critic and the resolver. didn't need the critic and the resolver. They didn't make much difference. So it They didn't make much difference. So it They didn't make much difference. So it was good to test them but ultimately was good to test them but ultimately was good to test them but ultimately didn't make a difference but they did didn't make a difference but they did didn't make a difference but they did cost three times as much in terms of cost three times as much in terms of cost three times as much in terms of dollar and minutes. So part of LLM is the prompt. minutes. So part of LLM is the prompt. minutes. So part of LLM is the prompt. I've shown an extract from the prompt I've shown an extract from the prompt I've shown an extract from the prompt here the types of things that we're here the types of things that we're here the types of things that we're looking for and this is taking the looking for and this is taking the looking for and this is taking the information from the C.WE guidance from information from the C.WE guidance from information from the C.WE guidance from the root cause mapping working group the root cause mapping working group the root cause mapping working group meeting notes and giving that to an LLM. meeting notes and giving that to an LLM. meeting notes and giving that to an LLM. So LLM can use this information the same So LLM can use this information the same So LLM can use this information the same information that people use. So in information that people use. So in information that people use. So in addition to the corpus, we have the addition to the corpus, we have the addition to the corpus, we have the guidance as well that LLM can use. Okay. So that's good. We've looked use. Okay. So that's good. We've looked use. Okay. So that's good. We've looked under the hood, but let's take a look at under the hood, but let's take a look at under the hood, but let's take a look at what comes what comes what comes out. See what that looks out. See what that looks out. See what that looks like. So this is the output from the like. So this is the output from the like. So this is the output from the retriever, i.e. before we provided the retriever, i.e. before we provided the retriever, i.e. before we provided the information to an LLM. So this information to an LLM. So this information to an LLM. So this information is useful to an LLM or a information is useful to an LLM or a information is useful to an LLM or a person. And in this case, we have the person. And in this case, we have the person. And in this case, we have the key phrases, we have the summarized um key phrases, we have the summarized um key phrases, we have the summarized um reference content, and we get a short reference content, and we get a short reference content, and we get a short list ranked of relevant CWES based on list ranked of relevant CWES based on list ranked of relevant CWES based on retrievers from the different retrievers from the different retrievers from the different retrievers, whether it's sparse etc. In retrievers, whether it's sparse etc. In retrievers, whether it's sparse etc. In this case, you can see that it's using this case, you can see that it's using this case, you can see that it's using the alternate terms. A lot of CWEs, I the alternate terms. A lot of CWEs, I the alternate terms. A lot of CWEs, I think about 10% have alternate terms. think about 10% have alternate terms. think about 10% have alternate terms. Um, and so we can use those as well. And Um, and so we can use those as well. And Um, and so we can use those as well. And then we would list off which I didn't then we would list off which I didn't then we would list off which I didn't show the effectively the page from our show the effectively the page from our show the effectively the page from our openbook exam with all the details of openbook exam with all the details of openbook exam with all the details of that specific CWE. Okay, not shown here. that specific CWE. Okay, not shown here. that specific CWE. Okay, not shown here. That's just part of the CWE spec. So That's just part of the CWE spec. So That's just part of the CWE spec. So that info is useful and I prel that info is useful and I prel that info is useful and I prel um we get to a short list of 10 from um we get to a short list of 10 from um we get to a short list of 10 from about a thousand. Okay, so what comes out of the thousand. Okay, so what comes out of the thousand. Okay, so what comes out of the LLM? So we want to get down to that LLM? So we want to get down to that LLM? So we want to get down to that shorter list of approximately one or two shorter list of approximately one or two shorter list of approximately one or two or whatever the candidate list depending or whatever the candidate list depending or whatever the candidate list depending on what it is. Um so what we get here is on what it is. Um so what we get here is on what it is. Um so what we get here is the table the we get our summary the table the we get our summary the table the we get our summary uh we get the CWE we get the name of the uh we get the CWE we get the name of the uh we get the CWE we get the name of the CWE we get the confidence we want to CWE we get the confidence we want to CWE we get the confidence we want to know how confident the LLM was. We get know how confident the LLM was. We get know how confident the LLM was. We get the abstraction level and we want to be the abstraction level and we want to be the abstraction level and we want to be lower level as in base and we get the um lower level as in base and we get the um lower level as in base and we get the um the mapping label from the tool was it the mapping label from the tool was it the mapping label from the tool was it primary secondary and we also get primary secondary and we also get primary secondary and we also get whether it was allowed or disallowed or whether it was allowed or disallowed or whether it was allowed or disallowed or allowed with review. So that's useful allowed with review. So that's useful allowed with review. So that's useful info and then we get the overall info and then we get the overall info and then we get the overall confidence and the rating on the confidence and the rating on the confidence and the rating on the evidence and then we get it to generate evidence and then we get it to generate evidence and then we get it to generate a picture as well that's useful to a picture as well that's useful to a picture as well that's useful to visually see and we get that sort of visually see and we get that sort of visually see and we get that sort of child of and how the different CWs fit child of and how the different CWs fit child of and how the different CWs fit together. And in this example, we're not together. And in this example, we're not together. And in this example, we're not going to go through it all, but it gives going to go through it all, but it gives going to go through it all, but it gives the description, the LLM gives the the description, the LLM gives the the description, the LLM gives the description of the vulnerability chain, description of the vulnerability chain, description of the vulnerability chain, how the CWs hang together, the summary how the CWs hang together, the summary how the CWs hang together, the summary and the rationale behind its analysis. and the rationale behind its analysis. and the rationale behind its analysis. And then just comparing this one example And then just comparing this one example And then just comparing this one example to the CWE gods as part of the top 25 to the CWE gods as part of the top 25 to the CWE gods as part of the top 25 mapping, we see that there was a mapping, we see that there was a mapping, we see that there was a difference. So they assigned 790. The difference. So they assigned 790. The difference. So they assigned 790. The tool assigned 791 where it's a child of tool assigned 791 where it's a child of tool assigned 791 where it's a child of 790. So one of the things I found in 790. So one of the things I found in 790. So one of the things I found in doing this is LLMs have no problem in doing this is LLMs have no problem in doing this is LLMs have no problem in going to the most specific one. It makes going to the most specific one. It makes going to the most specific one. It makes no difference to them. People often no difference to them. People often no difference to them. People often struggle because they're starting you struggle because they're starting you struggle because they're starting you know hierarchically can hold less things know hierarchically can hold less things know hierarchically can hold less things in their head. But LLMs given the you in their head. But LLMs given the you in their head. But LLMs given the you know info um can give you the most know info um can give you the most know info um can give you the most specific specific specific one. There is subtleties here between one. There is subtleties here between one. There is subtleties here between insufficient and improper, you know, and insufficient and improper, you know, and insufficient and improper, you know, and it's a fine line and you know in the it's a fine line and you know in the it's a fine line and you know in the context of top 25 you're going from context of top 25 you're going from context of top 25 you're going from wrong to more right or right wrong to more right or right wrong to more right or right enough. Another example is in this case enough. Another example is in this case enough. Another example is in this case we didn't have root cause or weakness. we didn't have root cause or weakness. we didn't have root cause or weakness. We just had a vulnerability description. We just had a vulnerability description. We just had a vulnerability description. Um we have our reference link content. Um we have our reference link content. Um we have our reference link content. Again the retrievers gave us a short Again the retrievers gave us a short Again the retrievers gave us a short list of CWEs with scores. We get the list of CWEs with scores. We get the list of CWEs with scores. We get the C.WE we corpus or sections or pages uh C.WE we corpus or sections or pages uh C.WE we corpus or sections or pages uh for those and then we give that to an for those and then we give that to an for those and then we give that to an LLM and the LLM in this case assigned LLM and the LLM in this case assigned LLM and the LLM in this case assigned 942 um top 25 assigned 923 and which is 942 um top 25 assigned 923 and which is 942 um top 25 assigned 923 and which is right or wrong I don't know but or it's right or wrong I don't know but or it's right or wrong I don't know but or it's case of more right than you know is more case of more right than you know is more case of more right than you know is more right wrong or whatever there's a right wrong or whatever there's a right wrong or whatever there's a difference between the assignments difference between the assignments difference between the assignments between what the LLM did and the the top between what the LLM did and the the top between what the LLM did and the the top 25 but SISA in this case assigned the 25 but SISA in this case assigned the 25 but SISA in this case assigned the same as the model 942 and again these same as the model 942 and again these same as the model 942 and again these are you are you are you the spec is very detailed and so we'll the spec is very detailed and so we'll the spec is very detailed and so we'll talk later about how you compare and you talk later about how you compare and you talk later about how you compare and you don't really want to compare in the don't really want to compare in the don't really want to compare in the exact mapping you want to compare you exact mapping you want to compare you exact mapping you want to compare you know is it near the mapping in terms of know is it near the mapping in terms of know is it near the mapping in terms of the graph so this is an example of what the graph so this is an example of what the graph so this is an example of what comes out okay these are just a few comes out okay these are just a few comes out okay these are just a few examples from the thousands that the examples from the thousands that the examples from the thousands that the tool uh analyzed and reviewed taking the low information one reviewed taking the low information one reviewed taking the low information one so um we talked about grounding and that so um we talked about grounding and that so um we talked about grounding and that LLMs are more than happy to fool us with LLMs are more than happy to fool us with LLMs are more than happy to fool us with their fluency and make up stuff in the their fluency and make up stuff in the their fluency and make up stuff in the absence of uh concrete evidence. So in absence of uh concrete evidence. So in absence of uh concrete evidence. So in this case, this is an example where all this case, this is an example where all this case, this is an example where all we have is the or exec service is we have is the or exec service is we have is the or exec service is running. That in itself isn't even a running. That in itself isn't even a running. That in itself isn't even a vulnerability. It depends on the vulnerability. It depends on the vulnerability. It depends on the context. That's part of the operating context. That's part of the operating context. That's part of the operating system. Maybe it should be running, system. Maybe it should be running, system. Maybe it should be running, maybe it isn't. But anyway, that's all maybe it isn't. But anyway, that's all maybe it isn't. But anyway, that's all we have to go on. And in this case, the we have to go on. And in this case, the we have to go on. And in this case, the LLM says, look, not enough evidence. LLM says, look, not enough evidence. LLM says, look, not enough evidence. Okay? And that's what we wanted to say. Okay? And that's what we wanted to say. Okay? And that's what we wanted to say. We don't want it, you know, to um create We don't want it, you know, to um create We don't want it, you know, to um create some pros about the specific service and some pros about the specific service and some pros about the specific service and what's likely happen. want to say sorry what's likely happen. want to say sorry what's likely happen. want to say sorry I don't know not enough evidence and so I don't know not enough evidence and so I don't know not enough evidence and so it does it does it does that that that okay so I'll hand you back to Alex okay so I'll hand you back to Alex okay so I'll hand you back to Alex now I'm glad that last vulnerability was now I'm glad that last vulnerability was now I'm glad that last vulnerability was disclosed in 1999 and not 2025 disclosed in 1999 and not 2025 disclosed in 1999 and not 2025 um how we doing on time we're good on um how we doing on time we're good on um how we doing on time we're good on time yeah all right great thank you um time yeah all right great thank you um time yeah all right great thank you um so just to give a little bit of color so just to give a little bit of color so just to give a little bit of color when we talk actually you did mention um when we talk actually you did mention um when we talk actually you did mention um 2023 top 2023 top 2023 top 25 mappics. And so what I wanted to talk 25 mappics. And so what I wanted to talk 25 mappics. And so what I wanted to talk about here just to give an evidence to about here just to give an evidence to about here just to give an evidence to what we're going to talk about in terms what we're going to talk about in terms what we're going to talk about in terms of how people do and manual processes of how people do and manual processes of how people do and manual processes work versus AI and LLMs. Um between 2019 work versus AI and LLMs. Um between 2019 work versus AI and LLMs. Um between 2019 and 2023, note this is not the most and 2023, note this is not the most and 2023, note this is not the most recent top recent top recent top 25. Um the CWE team would spend 25. Um the CWE team would spend 25. Um the CWE team would spend considerable time um evaluating the data considerable time um evaluating the data considerable time um evaluating the data set that it would use for the top 25 uh set that it would use for the top 25 uh set that it would use for the top 25 uh list that it publishes annually. And list that it publishes annually. And list that it publishes annually. And they would do this um in an effort uh they would do this um in an effort uh they would do this um in an effort uh that was herculean really and incomplete that was herculean really and incomplete that was herculean really and incomplete to be fair. Um the full data set of the to be fair. Um the full data set of the to be fair. Um the full data set of the top 25 in 2023 uh was not on this slide. top 25 in 2023 uh was not on this slide. top 25 in 2023 uh was not on this slide. I think it was like 30 something I think it was like 30 something I think it was like 30 something thousand 30,000 something like that CVE thousand 30,000 something like that CVE thousand 30,000 something like that CVE records. These cannot all be manually records. These cannot all be manually records. These cannot all be manually reviewed. The CWE CWE mappings may come reviewed. The CWE CWE mappings may come reviewed. The CWE CWE mappings may come from a vendor that's disclosing. They from a vendor that's disclosing. They from a vendor that's disclosing. They may come from a third party that's may come from a third party that's may come from a third party that's adding the information like the MVD. It adding the information like the MVD. It adding the information like the MVD. It may come from uh anywhere else. Uh how may come from uh anywhere else. Uh how may come from uh anywhere else. Uh how it happened in the old days, right? Um it happened in the old days, right? Um it happened in the old days, right? Um and one of the things was we have a and one of the things was we have a and one of the things was we have a keyword scraper that goes through all keyword scraper that goes through all keyword scraper that goes through all this data set and identifies where this data set and identifies where this data set and identifies where there's potential problems. for example, there's potential problems. for example, there's potential problems. for example, where there's a mapping to an extremely where there's a mapping to an extremely where there's a mapping to an extremely broad CWE like improper input validation broad CWE like improper input validation broad CWE like improper input validation or improper authorization. That's not or improper authorization. That's not or improper authorization. That's not very actionable. It's not very useful. very actionable. It's not very useful. very actionable. It's not very useful. It's not very useful for any real It's not very useful for any real It's not very useful for any real purpose uh to correct. The other thing purpose uh to correct. The other thing purpose uh to correct. The other thing that we saw is we would try to pair the that we saw is we would try to pair the that we saw is we would try to pair the descriptions with CWEs that were descriptions with CWEs that were descriptions with CWEs that were assigned and say, well, there's language assigned and say, well, there's language assigned and say, well, there's language in here that throws us a flag. So, in here that throws us a flag. So, in here that throws us a flag. So, basically what we would do is we would basically what we would do is we would basically what we would do is we would take that 30,000, it would get down to take that 30,000, it would get down to take that 30,000, it would get down to about 7,500. And our team would go about 7,500. And our team would go about 7,500. And our team would go through about 7,500 CVE records uh and through about 7,500 CVE records uh and through about 7,500 CVE records uh and their CWE mappings in an effort to try their CWE mappings in an effort to try their CWE mappings in an effort to try and address problems. Right? Some were and address problems. Right? Some were and address problems. Right? Some were mapped to insufficient info when there mapped to insufficient info when there mapped to insufficient info when there actually was enough info or some were actually was enough info or some were actually was enough info or some were mapped to uh very high level weaknesses mapped to uh very high level weaknesses mapped to uh very high level weaknesses that could be much more specific that could be much more specific that could be much more specific weaknesses. Sometimes they were mapped weaknesses. Sometimes they were mapped weaknesses. Sometimes they were mapped to a wrong, you know, incorrect uh to a wrong, you know, incorrect uh to a wrong, you know, incorrect uh weakness and otherwise. Um and really weakness and otherwise. Um and really weakness and otherwise. Um and really this resulted in thousands of remappings this resulted in thousands of remappings this resulted in thousands of remappings uh each each iteration and it uh each each iteration and it uh each each iteration and it contributed to a better trend analysis contributed to a better trend analysis contributed to a better trend analysis of the ecosystem in the top 25. Say what of the ecosystem in the top 25. Say what of the ecosystem in the top 25. Say what you will about uh the methodology but in you will about uh the methodology but in you will about uh the methodology but in terms of what it is measuring and how terms of what it is measuring and how terms of what it is measuring and how the ranked list is calculated. This the ranked list is calculated. This the ranked list is calculated. This helps improve the data. The limitations helps improve the data. The limitations helps improve the data. The limitations on this of course are that it is on this of course are that it is on this of course are that it is extremely resource intensive. It takes a extremely resource intensive. It takes a extremely resource intensive. It takes a lot of time. It takes a lot of staff. It lot of time. It takes a lot of staff. It lot of time. It takes a lot of staff. It takes a lot of understanding of how to takes a lot of understanding of how to takes a lot of understanding of how to do root cause analysis. The other thing do root cause analysis. The other thing do root cause analysis. The other thing is third-party analysts looking at CVE is third-party analysts looking at CVE is third-party analysts looking at CVE records are inherently less informed records are inherently less informed records are inherently less informed than those that know the product that than those that know the product that than those that know the product that know the vulnerability really well. So, know the vulnerability really well. So, know the vulnerability really well. So, it's in in a certain way limited by it's in in a certain way limited by it's in in a certain way limited by uncertainty as well um based on the uncertainty as well um based on the uncertainty as well um based on the information that's available and it's information that's available and it's information that's available and it's incomplete. I just told you we had a incomplete. I just told you we had a incomplete. I just told you we had a data set of 30,000. We looked at 7,500. data set of 30,000. We looked at 7,500. data set of 30,000. We looked at 7,500. We corrected a lot of that. I forget We corrected a lot of that. I forget We corrected a lot of that. I forget some somewhere between depending what some somewhere between depending what some somewhere between depending what was the problem we were looking into in was the problem we were looking into in was the problem we were looking into in the high 80s 90s percentage of the high 80s 90s percentage of the high 80s 90s percentage of correction but again just in that subset correction but again just in that subset correction but again just in that subset so the larger problem in the whole data so the larger problem in the whole data so the larger problem in the whole data set um did not get resolved um but it set um did not get resolved um but it set um did not get resolved um but it did generate us uh some good mappings to did generate us uh some good mappings to did generate us uh some good mappings to use for experimentation to see uh what a use for experimentation to see uh what a use for experimentation to see uh what a correct mapping for a vulnerability was correct mapping for a vulnerability was correct mapping for a vulnerability was and we can use that understanding to and we can use that understanding to and we can use that understanding to teach an LLM right to do better mappings teach an LLM right to do better mappings teach an LLM right to do better mappings so Um, I think that's what we're going so Um, I think that's what we're going so Um, I think that's what we're going to talk about now in terms of looking at to talk about now in terms of looking at to talk about now in terms of looking at how it does back. Oh, sorry. Say that. how it does back. Oh, sorry. Say that. how it does back. Oh, sorry. Say that. Go ahead. Go ahead. Go ahead. Yeah. What we're going to cover now is Yeah. What we're going to cover now is Yeah. What we're going to cover now is blah blah blam. Does it does it work and blah blah blam. Does it does it work and blah blah blam. Does it does it work and how much does it cost? All right. Punch line. line. line. Okay. So, to give you the stats on on Okay. So, to give you the stats on on Okay. So, to give you the stats on on cost. Um, and I've done lots of cost. Um, and I've done lots of cost. Um, and I've done lots of different analysis on, you know, CVEes different analysis on, you know, CVEes different analysis on, you know, CVEes as in the 260K published in 20 24. Um, as in the 260K published in 20 24. Um, as in the 260K published in 20 24. Um, and it's quite cheap depending on the and it's quite cheap depending on the and it's quite cheap depending on the analysis that you're doing and I've done analysis that you're doing and I've done analysis that you're doing and I've done lots of different analysis, but in this lots of different analysis, but in this lots of different analysis, but in this case taking the approximately 7K case taking the approximately 7K case taking the approximately 7K CVs cost about $15. All right. uh for CVs cost about $15. All right. uh for CVs cost about $15. All right. uh for those reports that you saw. Um and it those reports that you saw. Um and it those reports that you saw. Um and it was about $2 for embeddings where was about $2 for embeddings where was about $2 for embeddings where embeddings you convert your text to embeddings you convert your text to embeddings you convert your text to numbers so LLMs can numbers so LLMs can numbers so LLMs can compare. Uh it's 27 hours unattended. compare. Uh it's 27 hours unattended. compare. Uh it's 27 hours unattended. That's me kicking off a job and then you That's me kicking off a job and then you That's me kicking off a job and then you know going away and coming back. Um not know going away and coming back. Um not know going away and coming back. Um not at all optimized. No need to optimize in at all optimized. No need to optimize in at all optimized. No need to optimize in this case but obviously the more you run this case but obviously the more you run this case but obviously the more you run in parallel the quicker it can be. Um so in parallel the quicker it can be. Um so in parallel the quicker it can be. Um so overall yeah the dollar cost is very overall yeah the dollar cost is very overall yeah the dollar cost is very low. low. low. Um the quality is quite good. We'll talk Um the quality is quite good. We'll talk Um the quality is quite good. We'll talk about that in a moment. And I've listed about that in a moment. And I've listed about that in a moment. And I've listed off sort of the dollar costs you know off sort of the dollar costs you know off sort of the dollar costs you know for the other things whether it's for the other things whether it's for the other things whether it's keyphrase extraction. The reference keyphrase extraction. The reference keyphrase extraction. The reference content summarization is bigger. I used content summarization is bigger. I used content summarization is bigger. I used at a time the LLM was experimental so it at a time the LLM was experimental so it at a time the LLM was experimental so it was free to use. So I did that for that. was free to use. So I did that for that. was free to use. So I did that for that. That's the content there is big is in That's the content there is big is in That's the content there is big is in potentially gigabytes. Um so I it ended potentially gigabytes. Um so I it ended potentially gigabytes. Um so I it ended up being free because it was you know up being free because it was you know up being free because it was you know but that's where the the big content is. but that's where the the big content is. but that's where the the big content is. Uh everything else relatively cheap and Uh everything else relatively cheap and Uh everything else relatively cheap and fast. All right. and very easy to use. So we looked earlier at the data use. So we looked earlier at the data use. So we looked earlier at the data layers as in the raw CVE info, the layers as in the raw CVE info, the layers as in the raw CVE info, the enriched CV info, the retrievers and enriched CV info, the retrievers and enriched CV info, the retrievers and then the LLMs. So we can and should then the LLMs. So we can and should then the LLMs. So we can and should analyze the retriever performance analyze the retriever performance analyze the retriever performance independent of the LLM. The use the info independent of the LLM. The use the info independent of the LLM. The use the info out of the retrievers is useful on its out of the retrievers is useful on its out of the retrievers is useful on its own, but also it's the basis on which own, but also it's the basis on which own, but also it's the basis on which the human or the LLM is going to act. So the human or the LLM is going to act. So the human or the LLM is going to act. So what we're aiming for with the retriever what we're aiming for with the retriever what we're aiming for with the retriever is going from a thousand CWEs to a short is going from a thousand CWEs to a short is going from a thousand CWEs to a short list of list of list of 10. So we're focusing on the 10. So we're focusing on the 10. So we're focusing on the recall. And so that's reflected in the recall. And so that's reflected in the recall. And so that's reflected in the precision where it's 0.1 one and 10. But precision where it's 0.1 one and 10. But precision where it's 0.1 one and 10. But if we look at well you know um what the if we look at well you know um what the if we look at well you know um what the the stats are for the different the stats are for the different the stats are for the different retrievers we see that the sparse retrievers we see that the sparse retrievers we see that the sparse retriever retrieved whatever was about retriever retrieved whatever was about retriever retrieved whatever was about 9% 9% 9% 97% of the relevant CWEs as compared to 97% of the relevant CWEs as compared to 97% of the relevant CWEs as compared to the top 25 data set bearing in mind the the top 25 data set bearing in mind the the top 25 data set bearing in mind the top 25 data set was never designed to be top 25 data set was never designed to be top 25 data set was never designed to be a benchmark but that's the best we have a benchmark but that's the best we have a benchmark but that's the best we have to compare with and then the to compare with and then the to compare with and then the um the dense retriever finds some unique um the dense retriever finds some unique um the dense retriever finds some unique CWEs that the sparse didn't and the CWEs that the sparse didn't and the CWEs that the sparse didn't and the graph finds graph finds graph finds even less but some that the others even less but some that the others even less but some that the others didn't. So independently yeah the didn't. So independently yeah the didn't. So independently yeah the retrievers find things but the retrievers find things but the retrievers find things but the altogether they don't find some CWEs. altogether they don't find some CWEs. altogether they don't find some CWEs. The C CWES didn't match in the short The C CWES didn't match in the short The C CWES didn't match in the short list and that's usually because wasn't list and that's usually because wasn't list and that's usually because wasn't enough info in the CV description. We're enough info in the CV description. We're enough info in the CV description. We're working on live data here. The data has working on live data here. The data has working on live data here. The data has a quality problem. So we're going to a quality problem. So we're going to a quality problem. So we're going to miss some of them. All right. So that's miss some of them. All right. So that's miss some of them. All right. So that's again emphasizing the point. It's all again emphasizing the point. It's all again emphasizing the point. It's all about the good data at the point of about the good data at the point of about the good data at the point of entry in the CVEEs. So the uplevel view of that was yeah So the uplevel view of that was yeah So the uplevel view of that was yeah some of the problems um if we look some of the problems um if we look some of the problems um if we look at of the 50% of false negatives they at of the 50% of false negatives they at of the 50% of false negatives they were basically for CWE 20 which was were basically for CWE 20 which was were basically for CWE 20 which was assigned which is a discouraged uh assigned which is a discouraged uh assigned which is a discouraged uh class. So the LLM would have tried to class. So the LLM would have tried to class. So the LLM would have tried to avoid assigning that one. And the other avoid assigning that one. And the other avoid assigning that one. And the other part is um access control issues. What I part is um access control issues. What I part is um access control issues. What I found interestingly is found interestingly is found interestingly is through both the false positives and through both the false positives and through both the false positives and negatives were around access control. Um negatives were around access control. Um negatives were around access control. Um that's a concept that's difficult for that's a concept that's difficult for that's a concept that's difficult for people. It was a topic of discussion in people. It was a topic of discussion in people. It was a topic of discussion in one of the root cause mapping working one of the root cause mapping working one of the root cause mapping working groups. Uh but also if you look at the groups. Uh but also if you look at the groups. Uh but also if you look at the CWEs um it gets into fine detail and they can um it gets into fine detail and they can um it gets into fine detail and they can be confusing as to what's the difference be confusing as to what's the difference be confusing as to what's the difference between you know uh incorrect between you know uh incorrect between you know uh incorrect authorization versus improper authorization versus improper authorization versus improper authorization. And unless you're an authorization. And unless you're an authorization. And unless you're an expert, you may not know that. And expert, you may not know that. And expert, you may not know that. And similarly, the LLM may not know either. similarly, the LLM may not know either. similarly, the LLM may not know either. Um there are things we can do there. But Um there are things we can do there. But Um there are things we can do there. But that's from you know what came out. Um a that's from you know what came out. Um a that's from you know what came out. Um a lot of the issues were yeah the lot of the issues were yeah the lot of the issues were yeah the unhelpful CV links or the links couldn't unhelpful CV links or the links couldn't unhelpful CV links or the links couldn't be crawable. People are better at be crawable. People are better at be crawable. People are better at crawling links. You can crawl anything crawling links. You can crawl anything crawling links. You can crawl anything or in search web page tools aren't or in search web page tools aren't or in search web page tools aren't because they're either blocked or the because they're either blocked or the because they're either blocked or the website is designed not to allow tools website is designed not to allow tools website is designed not to allow tools to access them. So in a lot of cases uh to access them. So in a lot of cases uh to access them. So in a lot of cases uh it was because we didn't have the it was because we didn't have the it was because we didn't have the reference content and reference content reference content and reference content reference content and reference content is important usually more important than is important usually more important than is important usually more important than the actual description. Okay. So let's try to put into context what So let's try to put into context what So let's try to put into context what what we're doing here. what we're doing here. what we're doing here. Um so the game we're playing is imagine Um so the game we're playing is imagine Um so the game we're playing is imagine you have a dart board. So a traditional you have a dart board. So a traditional you have a dart board. So a traditional dartboard has 82 different segments with dartboard has 82 different segments with dartboard has 82 different segments with scores. Okay, here our dart board has a scores. Okay, here our dart board has a scores. Okay, here our dart board has a thousand segments of which about 500 are thousand segments of which about 500 are thousand segments of which about 500 are actually used in practice. And we're actually used in practice. And we're actually used in practice. And we're trying to map our darts to the same ones trying to map our darts to the same ones trying to map our darts to the same ones as were hit by the as were hit by the as were hit by the experts and we're assuming that the experts and we're assuming that the experts and we're assuming that the experts hit the right segments. Okay, experts hit the right segments. Okay, experts hit the right segments. Okay, that's a fair assumption given that that's a fair assumption given that that's a fair assumption given that they're they're experts. Um, so we have they're they're experts. Um, so we have they're they're experts. Um, so we have a few darts. We want to show the minimum a few darts. We want to show the minimum a few darts. We want to show the minimum number of darts as possible and we want number of darts as possible and we want number of darts as possible and we want to hit the same segments of that to hit the same segments of that to hit the same segments of that thousand segment dart board. You know, thousand segment dart board. You know, thousand segment dart board. You know, you can understand that's challenging you can understand that's challenging you can understand that's challenging just from that point of view. For CVEs, usually it's one dart to view. For CVEs, usually it's one dart to view. For CVEs, usually it's one dart to one CWE assigned. Sometimes two, three, one CWE assigned. Sometimes two, three, one CWE assigned. Sometimes two, three, it depends. A CVE can have multiple it depends. A CVE can have multiple it depends. A CVE can have multiple CWEs. Um, as I said, one is the most CWEs. Um, as I said, one is the most CWEs. Um, as I said, one is the most common. Three or four is fairly rare. We are per the requirements and We are per the requirements and We are per the requirements and discussions with the CWE root cause discussions with the CWE root cause discussions with the CWE root cause mapping working group. We want to have mapping working group. We want to have mapping working group. We want to have an assistant that recommends the short an assistant that recommends the short an assistant that recommends the short list of likely CWE. So we're not list of likely CWE. So we're not list of likely CWE. So we're not necessarily aiming for the one. We're necessarily aiming for the one. We're necessarily aiming for the one. We're saying hey here's the one and here's saying hey here's the one and here's saying hey here's the one and here's some other candidates. So now we're going to look candidates. So now we're going to look candidates. So now we're going to look at some let's call it data science at some let's call it data science at some let's call it data science metrics. metrics. metrics. um and more specific metrics. What we um and more specific metrics. What we um and more specific metrics. What we see from this point of view is I talked see from this point of view is I talked see from this point of view is I talked about the CWE being a graph and we don't about the CWE being a graph and we don't about the CWE being a graph and we don't have a benchmark data set and we don't have a benchmark data set and we don't have a benchmark data set and we don't have a standard way to measure or have a standard way to measure or have a standard way to measure or compare how a tool did versus the compare how a tool did versus the compare how a tool did versus the experts. So it's common in other data experts. So it's common in other data experts. So it's common in other data sets is to look at how close on the sets is to look at how close on the sets is to look at how close on the graph did you get. So if you didn't get graph did you get. So if you didn't get graph did you get. So if you didn't get an exact match, maybe you were let's say an exact match, maybe you were let's say an exact match, maybe you were let's say parent or child match or grandchild, parent or child match or grandchild, parent or child match or grandchild, cousin, whatever. So you were weren't cousin, whatever. So you were weren't cousin, whatever. So you were weren't exact but you were close enough. So we exact but you were close enough. So we exact but you were close enough. So we measure distance graph distance was it measure distance graph distance was it measure distance graph distance was it zero exact or was it one two and that's zero exact or was it one two and that's zero exact or was it one two and that's what we're looking at here. So just in what we're looking at here. So just in what we're looking at here. So just in terms of numbers you know terms of numbers you know terms of numbers you know um it's 81% in terms of has exact um it's 81% in terms of has exact um it's 81% in terms of has exact matches and then if you add in the other matches and then if you add in the other matches and then if you add in the other approximately 10% you get up to 90% if approximately 10% you get up to 90% if approximately 10% you get up to 90% if you cover the you know distance of one you cover the you know distance of one you cover the you know distance of one or two on the graph and then yeah or two on the graph and then yeah or two on the graph and then yeah there's about 10% not found as I said if there's about 10% not found as I said if there's about 10% not found as I said if you don't have the um reference content you don't have the um reference content you don't have the um reference content that would have been available to the that would have been available to the that would have been available to the experts but not to the LLM at the time experts but not to the LLM at the time experts but not to the LLM at the time um you know you're going to miss and so some of the takeaways Yeah. miss and so some of the takeaways Yeah. miss and so some of the takeaways Yeah. Um I won't go through them Um I won't go through them Um I won't go through them all, but when the data sets do disagree, all, but when the data sets do disagree, all, but when the data sets do disagree, they they tend to classify vulnerability they they tend to classify vulnerability they they tend to classify vulnerability in similar parts of the CWE hierarchy is in similar parts of the CWE hierarchy is in similar parts of the CWE hierarchy is is the key point. So, you know, even if is the key point. So, you know, even if is the key point. So, you know, even if it's not an exact match, you're within it's not an exact match, you're within it's not an exact match, you're within the area you want to be again useful for the area you want to be again useful for the area you want to be again useful for a human because you can then look at a human because you can then look at a human because you can then look at that area and decide, you know, based on that area and decide, you know, based on that area and decide, you know, based on what info you have that may not be in what info you have that may not be in what info you have that may not be in CV. Um look around CV. Um look around CV. Um look around there. So looking at it by abstraction, there. So looking at it by abstraction, there. So looking at it by abstraction, CWEs have different uh abstractions as CWEs have different uh abstractions as CWEs have different uh abstractions as I'm sure you know, reminder on the the I'm sure you know, reminder on the the I'm sure you know, reminder on the the plot on the bottom plot on the bottom plot on the bottom left. What we want to see here is the left. What we want to see here is the left. What we want to see here is the big numbers on the diagonal. All right, big numbers on the diagonal. All right, big numbers on the diagonal. All right, that the top 25 data set and the LLM that the top 25 data set and the LLM that the top 25 data set and the LLM agree. And that's what we see. Um, as it agree. And that's what we see. Um, as it agree. And that's what we see. Um, as it turns out, interestingly, with the turns out, interestingly, with the turns out, interestingly, with the compound one, compound one, compound one, um, yeah, we get very good matching even um, yeah, we get very good matching even um, yeah, we get very good matching even though that's the lowest one, but in though that's the lowest one, but in though that's the lowest one, but in general, we get the abstraction levels general, we get the abstraction levels general, we get the abstraction levels match. Okay, another data point. So, we match. Okay, another data point. So, we match. Okay, another data point. So, we can look at did the CWEs match exactly can look at did the CWEs match exactly can look at did the CWEs match exactly or close. Um, we can also look at the or close. Um, we can also look at the or close. Um, we can also look at the abstractions and they match very well too. Uh, especially at the base and the too. Uh, especially at the base and the too. Uh, especially at the base and the class levels and that's they're the ones class levels and that's they're the ones class levels and that's they're the ones that we're interested in practice. Okay, that we're interested in practice. Okay, that we're interested in practice. Okay, those are the ones that we expect to assign more detailed results. So, we assign more detailed results. So, we assign more detailed results. So, we don't show accuracy. If I was a vendor, don't show accuracy. If I was a vendor, don't show accuracy. If I was a vendor, I'd be standing up here telling you the I'd be standing up here telling you the I'd be standing up here telling you the accuracy of this tool is 99.99% and it's accuracy of this tool is 99.99% and it's accuracy of this tool is 99.99% and it's amazing. And you think, wow, brilliant. amazing. And you think, wow, brilliant. amazing. And you think, wow, brilliant. But that would be an abuse of data But that would be an abuse of data But that would be an abuse of data science. The accuracy is because there's science. The accuracy is because there's science. The accuracy is because there's a thousand, you know, potential areas a thousand, you know, potential areas a thousand, you know, potential areas and we're only throwing three darts. So, and we're only throwing three darts. So, and we're only throwing three darts. So, we're count we we're rewarded for not we're count we we're rewarded for not we're count we we're rewarded for not throwing the other 990 whatever darts throwing the other 990 whatever darts throwing the other 990 whatever darts anyway. So, we're not going to do that. anyway. So, we're not going to do that. anyway. So, we're not going to do that. Um so we look at balanced accuracy. All Um so we look at balanced accuracy. All Um so we look at balanced accuracy. All right. And it comes out at whatever is right. And it comes out at whatever is right. And it comes out at whatever is 90%. Um and I took two metrics. I took 90%. Um and I took two metrics. I took 90%. Um and I took two metrics. I took the raw CWEs and there was about 411 the raw CWEs and there was about 411 the raw CWEs and there was about 411 unique ones in the data set and then I unique ones in the data set and then I unique ones in the data set and then I also rolled them up to the 103 view also rolled them up to the 103 view also rolled them up to the 103 view which is the subset of 130 CWEs commonly which is the subset of 130 CWEs commonly which is the subset of 130 CWEs commonly used by NVD for mapping. And it's a way used by NVD for mapping. And it's a way used by NVD for mapping. And it's a way to easily um find the sets where the to easily um find the sets where the to easily um find the sets where the CWEs were, you know, a short distance CWEs were, you know, a short distance CWEs were, you know, a short distance away. A convenient way to do that. But away. A convenient way to do that. But away. A convenient way to do that. But either way, the numbers come out um 90% either way, the numbers come out um 90% either way, the numbers come out um 90% in terms of balanced accuracy. We're in terms of balanced accuracy. We're in terms of balanced accuracy. We're aiming for recall in this case. As I aiming for recall in this case. As I aiming for recall in this case. As I said, we want to get the short list of 1 said, we want to get the short list of 1 said, we want to get the short list of 1 2 3 4, not necessarily the one. So the 2 3 4, not necessarily the one. So the 2 3 4, not necessarily the one. So the precision is relatively low because of precision is relatively low because of precision is relatively low because of that. We're not aiming for the exact that. We're not aiming for the exact that. We're not aiming for the exact one. We want to get that short list. Um, one. We want to get that short list. Um, one. We want to get that short list. Um, so blah blah blah the stats are pretty so blah blah blah the stats are pretty so blah blah blah the stats are pretty good. All right. Even though we don't good. All right. Even though we don't good. All right. Even though we don't have a, you know, a benchmark data set, have a, you know, a benchmark data set, have a, you know, a benchmark data set, we don't have a standard way to measure we don't have a standard way to measure we don't have a standard way to measure this thing, but you know, using the data this thing, but you know, using the data this thing, but you know, using the data we have, the stats come out pretty good. All right, the pretty picture view good. All right, the pretty picture view good. All right, the pretty picture view of all that. Um, the pros, fast and of all that. Um, the pros, fast and of all that. Um, the pros, fast and cheap. Um, the LLMs can benefit whether cheap. Um, the LLMs can benefit whether cheap. Um, the LLMs can benefit whether it's experts or non-experts. it's experts or non-experts. it's experts or non-experts. um they can automate the CV enrichment um they can automate the CV enrichment um they can automate the CV enrichment which as I said I keep saying it that's which as I said I keep saying it that's which as I said I keep saying it that's the most important piece you know the most important piece you know the most important piece you know garbage in garbage out and we want garbage in garbage out and we want garbage in garbage out and we want correct accurate and timely information correct accurate and timely information correct accurate and timely information thereafter the whole LLM bit is thereafter the whole LLM bit is thereafter the whole LLM bit is secondary um and will work much better secondary um and will work much better secondary um and will work much better and then obviously if we have that we and then obviously if we have that we and then obviously if we have that we can automate the CWE assignment um it can automate the CWE assignment um it can automate the CWE assignment um it works really well if we have the data works really well if we have the data works really well if we have the data and it sometimes it works a lot better and it sometimes it works a lot better and it sometimes it works a lot better than people because they can go as than people because they can go as than people because they can go as specific they don't care you know that's specific they don't care you know that's specific they don't care you know that's not a a limitation for LLMs to be get to not a a limitation for LLMs to be get to not a a limitation for LLMs to be get to the exact uh specific the exact uh specific the exact uh specific CWE. So some of the cons less wisdom and CWE. So some of the cons less wisdom and CWE. So some of the cons less wisdom and I use the word deliberately wisdom I use the word deliberately wisdom I use the word deliberately wisdom versus knowledge. You can give them all versus knowledge. You can give them all versus knowledge. You can give them all the, you know, information you want, but the, you know, information you want, but the, you know, information you want, but in terms of making decisions on, you in terms of making decisions on, you in terms of making decisions on, you know, whether it was access control, know, whether it was access control, know, whether it was access control, improper versus insufficient or improper versus insufficient or improper versus insufficient or whatever, uh, authorization, they may whatever, uh, authorization, they may whatever, uh, authorization, they may not have the the wisdom to make those not have the the wisdom to make those not have the the wisdom to make those decisions in the absence of evidence. decisions in the absence of evidence. decisions in the absence of evidence. And that's where wi wisdom, you know, And that's where wi wisdom, you know, And that's where wi wisdom, you know, becomes important. And also poor web becomes important. And also poor web becomes important. And also poor web searching. Um, yeah, you can build a searching. Um, yeah, you can build a searching. Um, yeah, you can build a tool, as in I did, to crawl the web, but tool, as in I did, to crawl the web, but tool, as in I did, to crawl the web, but um, some websites have useful info. um, some websites have useful info. um, some websites have useful info. They're linked. um in the CVE, but They're linked. um in the CVE, but They're linked. um in the CVE, but they're not they're designed not to be they're not they're designed not to be they're not they're designed not to be accessible by machines. Okay. Um accessible by machines. Okay. Um accessible by machines. Okay. Um so that problem can be solved by well so that problem can be solved by well so that problem can be solved by well both problems can be solved by getting both problems can be solved by getting both problems can be solved by getting good data at the point of entry and good data at the point of entry and good data at the point of entry and summarizing the reference content and summarizing the reference content and summarizing the reference content and storing it somewhere. As I said 20% of storing it somewhere. As I said 20% of storing it somewhere. As I said 20% of the CBE link content is dead due to link the CBE link content is dead due to link the CBE link content is dead due to link rot. But overall it is practical to rot. But overall it is practical to rot. But overall it is practical to analyze the entire CVE data set. I've analyze the entire CVE data set. I've analyze the entire CVE data set. I've done it multiple times with different done it multiple times with different done it multiple times with different analysis whether it's keyphrase analysis whether it's keyphrase analysis whether it's keyphrase extraction, you know, reference content extraction, you know, reference content extraction, you know, reference content summarization, whatever. Definitely feasible. Okay, so given all of that, feasible. Okay, so given all of that, feasible. Okay, so given all of that, what's the vision for the future of root what's the vision for the future of root what's the vision for the future of root cause analysis in cyber cause analysis in cyber cause analysis in cyber security? My background isn't all this security? My background isn't all this security? My background isn't all this stuff. My background is product security stuff. My background is product security stuff. My background is product security and the security industry has learned and the security industry has learned and the security industry has learned that there's no point in telling people, that there's no point in telling people, that there's no point in telling people, you know, do these 20 steps um to be you know, do these 20 steps um to be you know, do these 20 steps um to be secure and compliant. That doesn't work. secure and compliant. That doesn't work. secure and compliant. That doesn't work. What works is give them the easy button. What works is give them the easy button. What works is give them the easy button. Um make it easy for them to do the right Um make it easy for them to do the right Um make it easy for them to do the right thing and they'll do the right thing. So thing and they'll do the right thing. So thing and they'll do the right thing. So what we really want to get to is make it what we really want to get to is make it what we really want to get to is make it easy to do the right thing. All right, easy to do the right thing. All right, easy to do the right thing. All right, simple as that. So how do we do that? simple as that. So how do we do that? simple as that. So how do we do that? Well, if we make it easy for people to Well, if we make it easy for people to Well, if we make it easy for people to submit the complete, accurate, and submit the complete, accurate, and submit the complete, accurate, and timely info, in other words, here's the timely info, in other words, here's the timely info, in other words, here's the reference content, here's my patch reference content, here's my patch reference content, here's my patch advisory, my code patch, whatever. advisory, my code patch, whatever. advisory, my code patch, whatever. Here's all this stuff, and I want to Here's all this stuff, and I want to Here's all this stuff, and I want to generate a CV description, reference generate a CV description, reference generate a CV description, reference content. I could give that to an LLM, content. I could give that to an LLM, content. I could give that to an LLM, and it could go and generate the content and it could go and generate the content and it could go and generate the content according to my template. So, we get the according to my template. So, we get the according to my template. So, we get the best of both worlds, the easy button, best of both worlds, the easy button, best of both worlds, the easy button, and we get that complete, accurate, and and we get that complete, accurate, and and we get that complete, accurate, and timely info. And that that's the most timely info. And that that's the most timely info. And that that's the most important point in all this. The rest is important point in all this. The rest is important point in all this. The rest is all secondary to this. Um, so it would all secondary to this. Um, so it would all secondary to this. Um, so it would be good to have a central uh CV be good to have a central uh CV be good to have a central uh CV repository for the extracted keyphrases. repository for the extracted keyphrases. repository for the extracted keyphrases. As I said, I've extracted the keyphrase As I said, I've extracted the keyphrase As I said, I've extracted the keyphrase in the reference content for 260k CVES in the reference content for 260k CVES in the reference content for 260k CVES published to the end of 2024, but it'd published to the end of 2024, but it'd published to the end of 2024, but it'd be nice to have a standard maintained, be nice to have a standard maintained, be nice to have a standard maintained, you know, repository for that info, you know, repository for that info, you know, repository for that info, whether as an ADP or whatever, some whether as an ADP or whatever, some whether as an ADP or whatever, some format that it's accessible. Um Alec and the folks were working on a Um Alec and the folks were working on a Um Alec and the folks were working on a interactive chatbot. Um I showed a you interactive chatbot. Um I showed a you interactive chatbot. Um I showed a you know prototype but we're working on um know prototype but we're working on um know prototype but we're working on um again making the content more accessible again making the content more accessible again making the content more accessible to users in the form of a chatbot and to users in the form of a chatbot and to users in the form of a chatbot and then there's a CWE solution. It is then there's a CWE solution. It is then there's a CWE solution. It is feasible to look at all published CWEs feasible to look at all published CWEs feasible to look at all published CWEs to date and CVE and then um assign the to date and CVE and then um assign the to date and CVE and then um assign the content and then to come up with a content and then to come up with a content and then to come up with a benchmark data set. The problem here is benchmark data set. The problem here is benchmark data set. The problem here is that we don't have a benchmark data set. that we don't have a benchmark data set. that we don't have a benchmark data set. a lot of academics do uh research and a lot of academics do uh research and a lot of academics do uh research and I'll talk to that in a moment. So on the point of user info moment. So on the point of user info moment. So on the point of user info submission um so vulneroggram is one of submission um so vulneroggram is one of submission um so vulneroggram is one of several common tools several common tools several common tools um one way to integrate with that with um one way to integrate with that with um one way to integrate with that with no changes to vulneroggram is to use the no changes to vulneroggram is to use the no changes to vulneroggram is to use the JSON that is imported um into volgram JSON that is imported um into volgram JSON that is imported um into volgram and our tools can create that content. and our tools can create that content. and our tools can create that content. So given the reference content an LLM So given the reference content an LLM So given the reference content an LLM can take can take can take that create the description according to that create the description according to that create the description according to the template extract out the key phrases the template extract out the key phrases the template extract out the key phrases for root cause and weakness etc. It can for root cause and weakness etc. It can for root cause and weakness etc. It can summarize the reference content uh it summarize the reference content uh it summarize the reference content uh it can assign the CWES based on the root can assign the CWES based on the root can assign the CWES based on the root cause and the weakness and other info cause and the weakness and other info cause and the weakness and other info and um put all that into the JSON which and um put all that into the JSON which and um put all that into the JSON which a user can then open in vulnergram and a user can then open in vulnergram and a user can then open in vulnergram and then refine if they want. So easy button then refine if they want. So easy button then refine if they want. So easy button there takes the hard work out of it and there takes the hard work out of it and there takes the hard work out of it and then allows a user to refine it. Okay, this is uh an idea that came it. Okay, this is uh an idea that came it. Okay, this is uh an idea that came up. Uh I was talking with Ronan um met up. Uh I was talking with Ronan um met up. Uh I was talking with Ronan um met him via the EPSS SIG uh who was a PhD him via the EPSS SIG uh who was a PhD him via the EPSS SIG uh who was a PhD student and you know we were talking student and you know we were talking student and you know we were talking about different I guess academics and about different I guess academics and about different I guess academics and industry folks like myself like to play industry folks like myself like to play industry folks like myself like to play with this stuff just for kicks for with this stuff just for kicks for with this stuff just for kicks for curiosity. Um, a lot of academics build tools, but Um, a lot of academics build tools, but Um, a lot of academics build tools, but the tools are generally not useful to the tools are generally not useful to the tools are generally not useful to industry that ever make it out into industry that ever make it out into industry that ever make it out into practical use because there's no practical use because there's no practical use because there's no benchmark data set. There's no way of benchmark data set. There's no way of benchmark data set. There's no way of comparing tools. So, somebody does comparing tools. So, somebody does comparing tools. So, somebody does something cool and that's it, the something cool and that's it, the something cool and that's it, the publish paper and that's the end of it. publish paper and that's the end of it. publish paper and that's the end of it. So what if we had a benchmark data set So what if we had a benchmark data set So what if we had a benchmark data set um that we agreed okay this is the data um that we agreed okay this is the data um that we agreed okay this is the data set here's the good mappings here's how set here's the good mappings here's how set here's the good mappings here's how we want to measure you know goodness um we want to measure you know goodness um we want to measure you know goodness um and then let's build better tools and and then let's build better tools and and then let's build better tools and share those and open source them. So, we share those and open source them. So, we share those and open source them. So, we talked about this open for ideiation and talked about this open for ideiation and talked about this open for ideiation and we're looking for feedback basically we're looking for feedback basically we're looking for feedback basically from people um if they'd be interested from people um if they'd be interested from people um if they'd be interested in something like this and if they are in something like this and if they are in something like this and if they are then we can get together and build this then we can get together and build this then we can get together and build this stuff out and whether it's for CVC CWE stuff out and whether it's for CVC CWE stuff out and whether it's for CVC CWE mapping, whether it's for keyphrase mapping, whether it's for keyphrase mapping, whether it's for keyphrase extraction, whatever. I think it'd be extraction, whatever. I think it'd be extraction, whatever. I think it'd be pretty cool if I was a student or you pretty cool if I was a student or you pretty cool if I was a student or you know in industry and I wanted to build know in industry and I wanted to build know in industry and I wanted to build my portfolio. I'd be getting my name my portfolio. I'd be getting my name my portfolio. I'd be getting my name here on the leaderboard saying, "Hey, here on the leaderboard saying, "Hey, here on the leaderboard saying, "Hey, look, I built this cool tool and it look, I built this cool tool and it look, I built this cool tool and it really, you know, solves an industry really, you know, solves an industry really, you know, solves an industry problem." That's what this is about. problem." That's what this is about. problem." That's what this is about. There's a lot of smart people out there. There's a lot of smart people out there. There's a lot of smart people out there. It'd be great to benefit from that It'd be great to benefit from that It'd be great to benefit from that smartness for the greater good. All smartness for the greater good. All smartness for the greater good. All right, so if you're interested, whether right, so if you're interested, whether right, so if you're interested, whether you're watching this here or sometime you're watching this here or sometime you're watching this here or sometime later on YouTube, uh, hit us up or hit later on YouTube, uh, hit us up or hit later on YouTube, uh, hit us up or hit him up specifically. Alrighty, I'll hand you specifically. Alrighty, I'll hand you specifically. Alrighty, I'll hand you back to Alex. Right. So, this is a back to Alex. Right. So, this is a back to Alex. Right. So, this is a chance also to let you guys know that chance also to let you guys know that chance also to let you guys know that there is a microphone over there. Uh, there is a microphone over there. Uh, there is a microphone over there. Uh, we're going to be transitioning to we're going to be transitioning to we're going to be transitioning to questions in a moment, but I also might questions in a moment, but I also might questions in a moment, but I also might start and go a little off script and start and go a little off script and start and go a little off script and give a C.WE fun fact. Uh, well, who am I give a C.WE fun fact. Uh, well, who am I give a C.WE fun fact. Uh, well, who am I kidding? CWE doesn't have fun facts. kidding? CWE doesn't have fun facts. kidding? CWE doesn't have fun facts. I'll give you some trivia. Um, C.WE I'll give you some trivia. Um, C.WE I'll give you some trivia. Um, C.WE trivia. So, it was mentioned the idea of trivia. So, it was mentioned the idea of trivia. So, it was mentioned the idea of improper and language in C.WE is improper and language in C.WE is improper and language in C.WE is very specific sometimes. And what does very specific sometimes. And what does very specific sometimes. And what does improper mean? uh and improper really improper mean? uh and improper really improper mean? uh and improper really means two things in the corpus, right? means two things in the corpus, right? means two things in the corpus, right? Which is why it is often the parent of Which is why it is often the parent of Which is why it is often the parent of sub, you know, of children that are sub, you know, of children that are sub, you know, of children that are those two things. And so what improper those two things. And so what improper those two things. And so what improper means is something is missing or it is means is something is missing or it is means is something is missing or it is incorrect. So if you're talking about incorrect. So if you're talking about incorrect. So if you're talking about improper authorization, you could have improper authorization, you could have improper authorization, you could have missing authorization or you could have missing authorization or you could have missing authorization or you could have incorrect authorization. So you've incorrect authorization. So you've incorrect authorization. So you've learned something about CWE. Um so uh learned something about CWE. Um so uh learned something about CWE. Um so uh before we go to questions again, just before we go to questions again, just before we go to questions again, just concluding and wrapping this all up, I concluding and wrapping this all up, I concluding and wrapping this all up, I know you guys have sat through a lot. know you guys have sat through a lot. know you guys have sat through a lot. Just to recap what are really key Just to recap what are really key Just to recap what are really key takeaways here um is that the foundation takeaways here um is that the foundation takeaways here um is that the foundation for good vulnerability for good vulnerability for good vulnerability management and reducing cyber security management and reducing cyber security management and reducing cyber security risk is really complete accurate and risk is really complete accurate and risk is really complete accurate and timely CVE data. That's what helps do uh timely CVE data. That's what helps do uh timely CVE data. That's what helps do uh both response understanding root cause both response understanding root cause both response understanding root cause mapping everything. Um it helps LLM do mapping everything. Um it helps LLM do mapping everything. Um it helps LLM do this better. It helps people who rely on this better. It helps people who rely on this better. It helps people who rely on root cause mapping and CWE assignment. root cause mapping and CWE assignment. root cause mapping and CWE assignment. Um, as Chris talked about, LLMs are good Um, as Chris talked about, LLMs are good Um, as Chris talked about, LLMs are good enough and cheap enough to be used for enough and cheap enough to be used for enough and cheap enough to be used for this purpose. Um, and right now the this purpose. Um, and right now the this purpose. Um, and right now the idea, and I think it's a really good idea, and I think it's a really good idea, and I think it's a really good one, is that we want the LLM to provide one, is that we want the LLM to provide one, is that we want the LLM to provide a couple of choices to choose from, and a couple of choices to choose from, and a couple of choices to choose from, and you can use your subject matter you can use your subject matter you can use your subject matter expertise for those. For example, if you expertise for those. For example, if you expertise for those. For example, if you are assigning a CVE record to know that are assigning a CVE record to know that are assigning a CVE record to know that vulnerability really, really well and vulnerability really, really well and vulnerability really, really well and have an ability to get a couple C.WE have an ability to get a couple C.WE have an ability to get a couple C.WE mappings to choose from um, easier, mappings to choose from um, easier, mappings to choose from um, easier, right? rather than learning the entire right? rather than learning the entire right? rather than learning the entire corpus. Um, and as with all things, corpus. Um, and as with all things, corpus. Um, and as with all things, CVECWE, community engagement will CVECWE, community engagement will CVECWE, community engagement will continue to drive our advancements. continue to drive our advancements. continue to drive our advancements. These are community programs and that These are community programs and that These are community programs and that really drives all that we do. Um, as really drives all that we do. Um, as really drives all that we do. Um, as Chris mentioned, we have ideas about Chris mentioned, we have ideas about Chris mentioned, we have ideas about model refinement in terms of what's model refinement in terms of what's model refinement in terms of what's already been developed. Um, and also already been developed. Um, and also already been developed. Um, and also root cause mapping working group root cause mapping working group root cause mapping working group discussion. So, if you're interested in discussion. So, if you're interested in discussion. So, if you're interested in that, do reach out. Um and lastly, yeah, that, do reach out. Um and lastly, yeah, that, do reach out. Um and lastly, yeah, we have a work in progress underway for we have a work in progress underway for we have a work in progress underway for a CWE chatbot which will provide value a CWE chatbot which will provide value a CWE chatbot which will provide value to the CWE corpus itself. But when it to the CWE corpus itself. But when it to the CWE corpus itself. But when it comes to assignment of CWE records at comes to assignment of CWE records at comes to assignment of CWE records at the time of disclosure, um that's sort the time of disclosure, um that's sort the time of disclosure, um that's sort of one step removed. It'll certainly be of one step removed. It'll certainly be of one step removed. It'll certainly be helpful. I think ideally long-term if I helpful. I think ideally long-term if I helpful. I think ideally long-term if I were to have my magic wand, I would say were to have my magic wand, I would say were to have my magic wand, I would say that this would be something that was that this would be something that was that this would be something that was integrated into the clients that help integrated into the clients that help integrated into the clients that help those generate CVE records, right? So those generate CVE records, right? So those generate CVE records, right? So many of you might be familiar with many of you might be familiar with many of you might be familiar with vulnerog something like this. if it had vulnerog something like this. if it had vulnerog something like this. if it had an ability to help you find a C.WE uh or an ability to help you find a C.WE uh or an ability to help you find a C.WE uh or two to consider um rather than trying to two to consider um rather than trying to two to consider um rather than trying to just do word search, word map, title just do word search, word map, title just do word search, word map, title mapping, right, of a C.WE. Uh that would mapping, right, of a C.WE. Uh that would mapping, right, of a C.WE. Uh that would be a considerable unlock, I think, for be a considerable unlock, I think, for be a considerable unlock, I think, for the ecosystem. So, uh with that said, we the ecosystem. So, uh with that said, we the ecosystem. So, uh with that said, we have about eight minutes or so. Not bad. have about eight minutes or so. Not bad. have about eight minutes or so. Not bad. You there's a mic there you could grab, You there's a mic there you could grab, You there's a mic there you could grab, too. If you have a question for Chris or too.

I am MITER CVE and CWEB project lead. Um, so MITER CVE and CWEB project lead. Um, so MITER CVE and CWEB project lead. Um, so happy to answer any questions about this happy to answer any questions about this happy to answer any questions about this topic. topic. topic. Um, if there's any online, please Um, if there's any online, please Um, if there's any online, please hopefully somebody can tell us as well. There's a mic over well. There's a mic over well. There's a mic over there. Uh, man with a beard. He's got there. Uh, man with a beard. He's got there. Uh, man with a beard. He's got the mic. How much for that? Testing. It does work. that? Testing. It does work. that? Testing. It does work. Right. Can you hear? Yeah. Can you can Right. Can you hear? Yeah. Can you can Right. Can you hear? Yeah. Can you can hear me? Yeah. Um, my name is Serge hear me? Yeah. Um, my name is Serge hear me? Yeah. Um, my name is Serge Mishuk from uh Cisco Systems. Thank you Mishuk from uh Cisco Systems. Thank you Mishuk from uh Cisco Systems. Thank you for insightful presentation. I have two for insightful presentation. I have two for insightful presentation. I have two questions. Uh first of all, did you have questions. Uh first of all, did you have questions. Uh first of all, did you have a use case in your post-raining process a use case in your post-raining process a use case in your post-raining process of LM of LM of LM uh to work with uh CV disposition? So uh to work with uh CV disposition? So uh to work with uh CV disposition? So for example, your model is already for example, your model is already for example, your model is already providing good matching for the CV but providing good matching for the CV but providing good matching for the CV but for example time flies and some CV is for example time flies and some CV is for example time flies and some CV is already obsolete and how you ingest this already obsolete and how you ingest this already obsolete and how you ingest this disposition data for example something disposition data for example something disposition data for example something was already fixed. Uh that's the first was already fixed. Uh that's the first was already fixed. Uh that's the first question and another question is uh with question and another question is uh with question and another question is uh with this chat bot are you going to make it this chat bot are you going to make it this chat bot are you going to make it like public and then it can be like used like public and then it can be like used like public and then it can be like used by community? Thank you. So I'll take the first one. Um my So I'll take the first one. Um my So I'll take the first one. Um my understanding and you can clarify the understanding and you can clarify the understanding and you can clarify the question is is this question is is this question is is this about drift as in new vulnerability about drift as in new vulnerability about drift as in new vulnerability concepts come along and the model concepts come along and the model concepts come along and the model doesn't keep up with them. Is that the doesn't keep up with them. Is that the doesn't keep up with them. Is that the concern? concern? concern? Yes. How to make the stale data Yes. How to make the stale data Yes. How to make the stale data out of the model and possibly reduce the out of the model and possibly reduce the out of the model and possibly reduce the hallation of the LM? Sure. So the model hallation of the LM? Sure. So the model hallation of the LM? Sure. So the model is not fine-tuned or trained. Um and as is not fine-tuned or trained. Um and as is not fine-tuned or trained. Um and as such if we take example a new CWE was such if we take example a new CWE was such if we take example a new CWE was published in October related to AI the published in October related to AI the published in October related to AI the model would actually work better with model would actually work better with model would actually work better with that because it shows up in the rag that because it shows up in the rag that because it shows up in the rag corpus as a relatively unique CWE corpus as a relatively unique CWE corpus as a relatively unique CWE amongst other CWEs. So I chose amongst other CWEs. So I chose amongst other CWEs. So I chose deliberately not to fine-tune the model. deliberately not to fine-tune the model. deliberately not to fine-tune the model. It's it's really rag as in the retrieval It's it's really rag as in the retrieval It's it's really rag as in the retrieval part not the finetuning. So you just part not the finetuning. So you just part not the finetuning. So you just update the CWE corpus um and I guess the update the CWE corpus um and I guess the update the CWE corpus um and I guess the guidance uh from CWE and if that covers guidance uh from CWE and if that covers guidance uh from CWE and if that covers the new vulnerability then you're good the new vulnerability then you're good the new vulnerability then you're good there as said a delivery avoided tuning there as said a delivery avoided tuning there as said a delivery avoided tuning um the model for that purpose. So it um the model for that purpose. So it um the model for that purpose. So it works better for the idea of concept works better for the idea of concept works better for the idea of concept drift drift is less of a concern because drift drift is less of a concern because drift drift is less of a concern because we're not tuning or overfitting to we're not tuning or overfitting to we're not tuning or overfitting to vulnerabilities. Does does that help vulnerabilities. Does does that help vulnerabilities. Does does that help answer the question? Yeah. Thank you. answer the question? Yeah. Thank you. answer the question? Yeah. Thank you. Yep. Okay. And the second question was, Yep. Okay. And the second question was, Yep. Okay. And the second question was, are we going to make the CWE chatbot are we going to make the CWE chatbot are we going to make the CWE chatbot public? I believe uh yes. So I would public? I believe uh yes. So I would public? I believe uh yes. So I would answer that with actually two things. So answer that with actually two things. So answer that with actually two things. So actually I'll start with answering your actually I'll start with answering your actually I'll start with answering your question. Um yes, the idea is that question. Um yes, the idea is that question. Um yes, the idea is that ultimately we would like this to be part ultimately we would like this to be part ultimately we would like this to be part of the uh C.WE website in a way that of the uh C.WE website in a way that of the uh C.WE website in a way that someone going to the website can not someone going to the website can not someone going to the website can not only interact with the data and search only interact with the data and search only interact with the data and search and refine what they're looking for via and refine what they're looking for via and refine what they're looking for via search, right? uh but with an actual search, right? uh but with an actual search, right? uh but with an actual interactive capability chatbot. The interactive capability chatbot. The interactive capability chatbot. The other thing that I'd want to plug again other thing that I'd want to plug again other thing that I'd want to plug again is that Chris had put together a is that Chris had put together a is that Chris had put together a remarkable um set of open source remarkable um set of open source remarkable um set of open source guidance tools for people to set up guidance tools for people to set up guidance tools for people to set up their own CWE chatbot and refine it with their own CWE chatbot and refine it with their own CWE chatbot and refine it with some really great guidance and I I don't some really great guidance and I I don't some really great guidance and I I don't think we have a link in the slides think we have a link in the slides think we have a link in the slides anywhere or do we there is a link in the anywhere or do we there is a link in the anywhere or do we there is a link in the slide to that and that it' be useful if slide to that and that it' be useful if slide to that and that it' be useful if you want to play with that and then give you want to play with that and then give you want to play with that and then give feedback for the real thing. It's a way feedback for the real thing. It's a way feedback for the real thing. It's a way to play and yeah I don't know if people to play and yeah I don't know if people to play and yeah I don't know if people heard what he said but if you want to heard what he said but if you want to heard what he said but if you want to use it's in the slide so you can see it use it's in the slide so you can see it use it's in the slide so you can see it online. Um, the other thing is if for online. Um, the other thing is if for online. Um, the other thing is if for ease, if you just want to email ease, if you just want to email ease, if you just want to email cwminmeriter.org and say, "Hey, you said cwminmeriter.org and say, "Hey, you said cwminmeriter.org and say, "Hey, you said I could set up an LLM for free today, I could set up an LLM for free today, I could set up an LLM for free today, how do I do it?" We'll give you that how do I do it?" We'll give you that how do I do it?" We'll give you that answer. And it's Chris Madden's answer. And it's Chris Madden's answer. And it's Chris Madden's remarkable work for that. Um, but yes, remarkable work for that. Um, but yes, remarkable work for that. Um, but yes, and the point Chris made just now is and the point Chris made just now is and the point Chris made just now is that if you do do that and you have that if you do do that and you have that if you do do that and you have thoughts, uh, to please let us know as thoughts, uh, to please let us know as thoughts, uh, to please let us know as to what might be valuable to incorporate to what might be valuable to incorporate to what might be valuable to incorporate into the C.WE chatbot. And if you have a into the C.WE chatbot. And if you have a into the C.WE chatbot. And if you have a great name for it, too, because CWE great name for it, too, because CWE great name for it, too, because CWE chatbot's kind of lame. Gary something. chatbot's kind of lame. Gary something. chatbot's kind of lame. Gary something. All right. Thank you. Get a free 25 year All right. Thank you. Get a free 25 year All right. Thank you. Get a free 25 year anniversary. You might get a free the anniversary. You might get a free the anniversary. You might get a free the best name. Maybe you'll get a prize. All best name. Maybe you'll get a prize. All best name. Maybe you'll get a prize. All right. So, there is a question in the um right. So, there is a question in the um right. So, there is a question in the um Discord channel first. Interested in Discord channel first. Interested in Discord channel first. Interested in studying the proposed model at a later studying the proposed model at a later studying the proposed model at a later time? Who or what email can I reach out time? Who or what email can I reach out time? Who or what email can I reach out to? CWEMER.org. So, I can put it in the chat later on. So, I can put it in the chat later on. So, I can put it in the chat later on. Uh and there's another one which says Uh and there's another one which says Uh and there's another one which says for the development of the chatbot do for the development of the chatbot do for the development of the chatbot do you plan to use APIs from providers like you plan to use APIs from providers like you plan to use APIs from providers like OpenAI or are you considering using a OpenAI or are you considering using a OpenAI or are you considering using a self-hosted model such as Llama? But self-hosted model such as Llama? But self-hosted model such as Llama? But you're talking about the Yeah. Yeah. So you're talking about the Yeah. Yeah. So you're talking about the Yeah. Yeah. So it depends on cost and the the MIER team it depends on cost and the the MIER team it depends on cost and the the MIER team both are up for grabs. It depends on I both are up for grabs. It depends on I both are up for grabs. It depends on I guess cost and and quality. Um and both guess cost and and quality. Um and both guess cost and and quality. Um and both are under consideration. are under consideration. are under consideration. The one thing about models is the new The one thing about models is the new The one thing about models is the new best model changes every month. Um, best model changes every month. Um, best model changes every month. Um, having played with models, it's all having played with models, it's all having played with models, it's all about the data, not the model. So, so about the data, not the model. So, so about the data, not the model. So, so you know, there's no point in planning you know, there's no point in planning you know, there's no point in planning which model you're going to use because which model you're going to use because which model you're going to use because by the time we get there, it'll be by the time we get there, it'll be by the time we get there, it'll be different and it'll be different again different and it'll be different again different and it'll be different again the month later, right? Sorry, I wanted to know if I could get Sorry, I wanted to know if I could get Sorry, I wanted to know if I could get um more general information or update my um more general information or update my um more general information or update my knowledge about this particular slide as knowledge about this particular slide as knowledge about this particular slide as far as learning what that benchmark data far as learning what that benchmark data far as learning what that benchmark data set is. What uh you've got benefits of set is. What uh you've got benefits of set is. What uh you've got benefits of participation and I want to know participation and I want to know participation and I want to know participation in what specifically? participation in what specifically? participation in what specifically? Yeah, that's different. Yeah. Yeah. So Yeah, that's different. Yeah. Yeah. So Yeah, that's different. Yeah. Yeah. So because we're at ideation, it really because we're at ideation, it really because we're at ideation, it really depends on kind of what people want. depends on kind of what people want. depends on kind of what people want. What we would like is lots of the What we would like is lots of the What we would like is lots of the community to participate with the community to participate with the community to participate with the experts to come up with what is a good experts to come up with what is a good experts to come up with what is a good benchmark data set. Um how do we benchmark data set. Um how do we benchmark data set. Um how do we measure, how do you contribute, what measure, how do you contribute, what measure, how do you contribute, what would such a thing look like, what do would such a thing look like, what do would such a thing look like, what do you want and allow the community to you want and allow the community to you want and allow the community to better participate in a standard way. So better participate in a standard way. So better participate in a standard way. So it's because it's ideation, we it's because it's ideation, we it's because it's ideation, we deliberately didn't specify exactly what deliberately didn't specify exactly what deliberately didn't specify exactly what we want. We don't know. It depends on we want. We don't know. It depends on we want. We don't know. It depends on what people So basically contact us and what people So basically contact us and what people So basically contact us and say hey I would really like to see say hey I would really like to see say hey I would really like to see whatever and then it you know if there's whatever and then it you know if there's whatever and then it you know if there's enough people say we want that then we enough people say we want that then we enough people say we want that then we can do that. Um it's really as I said can do that. Um it's really as I said can do that. Um it's really as I said this stem from a conversation where we this stem from a conversation where we this stem from a conversation where we want a better way to involve the want a better way to involve the want a better way to involve the community with standard stuff. All right community with standard stuff. All right community with standard stuff. All right and so we're wide open to that. Um and so we're wide open to that. Um and so we're wide open to that. Um so we are out of time and I think we're so we are out of time and I think we're so we are out of time and I think we're holding you up on lunch. So that's holding you up on lunch. So that's holding you up on lunch. So that's Chris. I'm Alec. If you have further Chris. I'm Alec. If you have further Chris. I'm Alec. If you have further questions, please walk up to us. It's questions, please walk up to us. It's questions, please walk up to us. It's fine with me. Um, thank you so much for fine with me. Um, thank you so much for fine with me.
