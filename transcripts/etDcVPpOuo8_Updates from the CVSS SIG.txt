So in the last year there have been many So in the last year there have been many So in the last year there have been many vendors who being being uh who who've vendors who being being uh who who've vendors who being being uh who who've adopted CVS version 4. The CVE program adopted CVS version 4. The CVE program adopted CVS version 4. The CVE program and NVD have both added tooling support and NVD have both added tooling support and NVD have both added tooling support for CVSS version 4 in their for CVSS version 4 in their for CVSS version 4 in their environments. Um the CVE program is environments. Um the CVE program is environments. Um the CVE program is going on 5,000 CVSS version 4 vectors in going on 5,000 CVSS version 4 vectors in going on 5,000 CVSS version 4 vectors in their environment, you know, in their their environment, you know, in their their environment, you know, in their database. database. database. the the the um GitHub really is the largest um GitHub really is the largest um GitHub really is the largest uh adopter of of CVSS version 4, the uh adopter of of CVSS version 4, the uh adopter of of CVSS version 4, the largest producer of CVSS version 4. largest producer of CVSS version 4. largest producer of CVSS version 4. They're going on They're going on They're going on 8,000 CVSS version 4 vectors in their 8,000 CVSS version 4 vectors in their 8,000 CVSS version 4 vectors in their database between reviewed and unreed database between reviewed and unreed database between reviewed and unreed data. data. data. And um there are at my count 56 unique And um there are at my count 56 unique And um there are at my count 56 unique vendors who are producing CVSS version 4 vendors who are producing CVSS version 4 vendors who are producing CVSS version 4 scores. Uh the largest by far in the CVE scores. Uh the largest by far in the CVE scores. Uh the largest by far in the CVE database is V DB followed by Juniper, database is V DB followed by Juniper, database is V DB followed by Juniper, Intel, Seammens and severalerts Intel, Seammens and severalerts Intel, Seammens and severalerts including ICSERT and including ICSERT and including ICSERT and CISA. So a lot of there have been a lot CISA. So a lot of there have been a lot CISA. So a lot of there have been a lot of producers of of CVSS version 4 and we of producers of of CVSS version 4 and we of producers of of CVSS version 4 and we continue to work on the the continue to work on the the continue to work on the the documentation.

There's already existing their product. There's already existing their product. There's already existing CVSS assessment for it and they generate CVSS assessment for it and they generate CVSS assessment for it and they generate a new CVSS vector that's appropriate to a new CVSS vector that's appropriate to a new CVSS vector that's appropriate to their own platform. That's something a their own platform. That's something a their own platform. That's something a lot of vendors are doing and we're lot of vendors are doing and we're lot of vendors are doing and we're trying to put more support behind that trying to put more support behind that trying to put more support behind that so that c consumers and producers can so that c consumers and producers can so that c consumers and producers can understand what unique per platform understand what unique per platform understand what unique per platform impacts there are uh for for certain impacts there are uh for for certain impacts there are uh for for certain vulnerabilities. A question in the when vulnerabilities. A question in the when vulnerabilities. A question in the when you talk about CVSS vectors I know you talk about CVSS vectors I know you talk about CVSS vectors I know there's 10 vectors attack vectors and there's 10 vectors attack vectors and there's 10 vectors attack vectors and stuff to make them current. You mean stuff to make them current. You mean stuff to make them current. You mean like 11 12 13 vectors that are used in like 11 12 13 vectors that are used in like 11 12 13 vectors that are used in the base calculation? No I'm sorry. So the base calculation? No I'm sorry. So the base calculation? No I'm sorry. So we talk about the vector string as all we talk about the vector string as all we talk about the vector string as all the metrics that make up CVSS. So in the metrics that make up CVSS. So in the metrics that make up CVSS. So in this process we're talking about a a c this process we're talking about a a c this process we're talking about a a c like Cisco for example we have a CVE like Cisco for example we have a CVE like Cisco for example we have a CVE that affects our environment. There's a that affects our environment. There's a that affects our environment. There's a CVSS vector for that. Say it's a CVSS vector for that. Say it's a CVSS vector for that. Say it's a vulnerability in OpenSSL. It has this vulnerability in OpenSSL. It has this vulnerability in OpenSSL. It has this impact that's in NVD or the CVE program. impact that's in NVD or the CVE program. impact that's in NVD or the CVE program. We take that, we generate a whole new We take that, we generate a whole new We take that, we generate a whole new vector that's a new base vector string vector that's a new base vector string vector that's a new base vector string with all of the vectors and then it's with all of the vectors and then it's with all of the vectors and then it's unique on a per platform basis. So it's unique on a per platform basis. So it's unique on a per platform basis. So it's for the same CVE, but it is different for the same CVE, but it is different for the same CVE, but it is different than the vector that was produced by than the vector that was produced by than the vector that was produced by either NVD or the the primary vendor in either NVD or the the primary vendor in either NVD or the the primary vendor in the CVE program. So when you have the CVE program. So when you have the CVE program. So when you have individual v vendors doing that, doesn't individual v vendors doing that, doesn't individual v vendors doing that, doesn't that kind of get away from the whole that kind of get away from the whole that kind of get away from the whole standardization of these are the the standardization of these are the the standardization of these are the the these are the calculations we're using these are the calculations we're using these are the calculations we're using in the vendor in the vectors to in the vendor in the vectors to in the vendor in the vectors to calculate an objective score on this calculate an objective score on this calculate an objective score on this particular CVE. Well, it is still the particular CVE. Well, it is still the particular CVE. Well, it is still the standard. It's still all of the standard standard. It's still all of the standard standard. It's still all of the standard vectors, but the assessment is more vectors, but the assessment is more vectors, but the assessment is more appropriate to the platform. There's 17 different routers, you know, There's 17 different routers, you know, There's 17 different routers, you know, all the wireless stuff. Yes. Sorry. all the wireless stuff. Yes. Sorry. all the wireless stuff. Yes. Sorry. Yeah. So, the comment was uh talking Yeah. So, the comment was uh talking Yeah. So, the comment was uh talking about the differences between the impact about the differences between the impact about the differences between the impact of a vulnerability on a workstation of a vulnerability on a workstation of a vulnerability on a workstation versus a server on the on a router versus a server on the on a router versus a server on the on a router versus a firewall versus an endpoint. versus a firewall versus an endpoint. versus a firewall versus an endpoint. Exactly. Yes. So the the standard is the Exactly. Yes. So the the standard is the Exactly. Yes. So the the standard is the same, the vectors are all the same. Uh same, the vectors are all the same. Uh same, the vectors are all the same. Uh but they are assessed differently per but they are assessed differently per but they are assessed differently per platform. So you can take a look at the platform. So you can take a look at the platform. So you can take a look at the the most recent FAQ the most recent FAQ the most recent FAQ first.orgcvs FAQ and uh that vector first.orgcvs FAQ and uh that vector first.orgcvs FAQ and uh that vector reassessment to to help explain it. reassessment to to help explain it. reassessment to to help explain it. Yeah. So, we're trying to get to where Yeah. So, we're trying to get to where Yeah. So, we're trying to get to where we can have more relevant per platform we can have more relevant per platform we can have more relevant per platform assessments, not just one broad one for assessments, not just one broad one for assessments, not just one broad one for every CVE that exists for every platform every CVE that exists for every platform every CVE that exists for every platform and product on the planet, but something and product on the planet, but something and product on the planet, but something that's more unique to the platform. that's more unique to the platform. that's more unique to the platform. So, basically, when we're looking at a a So, basically, when we're looking at a a So, basically, when we're looking at a a per product for for a vendor, we're per product for for a vendor, we're per product for for a vendor, we're we're looking at a contextbased risk as we're looking at a contextbased risk as we're looking at a contextbased risk as opposed to the general CVSs which is in opposed to the general CVSs which is in opposed to the general CVSs which is in the CVE. The question I've got is is I the CVE. The question I've got is is I the CVE. The question I've got is is I mean because I could listening to him I mean because I could listening to him I mean because I could listening to him I I heard it in his voice. It's like well I heard it in his voice. It's like well I heard it in his voice. It's like well we've already got the CBSS. So how do we we've already got the CBSS. So how do we we've already got the CBSS. So how do we go about arguing that with like say a go about arguing that with like say a go about arguing that with like say a customer of of of Cisco or a regulate customer of of of Cisco or a regulate customer of of of Cisco or a regulate like an agency a government agency who's like an agency a government agency who's like an agency a government agency who's going to look and say CVE said this was going to look and say CVE said this was going to look and say CVE said this was a nine. We need this remediated now and a nine. We need this remediated now and a nine. We need this remediated now and you're saying it's a three. It'll be you're saying it's a three. It'll be you're saying it's a three. It'll be fixed in a version three months from now fixed in a version three months from now fixed in a version three months from now because it's not critical. I I'm not a because it's not critical. I I'm not a because it's not critical. I I'm not a lawyer. I'm not a regulator. I don't lawyer. I'm not a regulator. I don't lawyer. I'm not a regulator. I don't know how to answer that question, but at know how to answer that question, but at know how to answer that question, but at least you can start by looking the FAQ least you can start by looking the FAQ least you can start by looking the FAQ on on on first.org/cvss and say, you know, hear first.org/cvss and say, you know, hear first.org/cvss and say, you know, hear them say, hey, this came from my vendor them say, hey, this came from my vendor them say, hey, this came from my vendor who should know more about their product who should know more about their product who should know more about their product than the score in the NVD and we should than the score in the NVD and we should than the score in the NVD and we should use that assessment because they know use that assessment because they know use that assessment because they know better. That's a very loaded question. better. That's a very loaded question. better. That's a very loaded question. When you say the vendor should know When you say the vendor should know When you say the vendor should know more, I don't dis dispute that the more, I don't dis dispute that the more, I don't dis dispute that the vendor knows more. I also know that the vendor knows more. I also know that the vendor knows more. I also know that the vendor has a incentive to not have a vendor has a incentive to not have a vendor has a incentive to not have a high high high respon active in their system. A and the respon active in their system. A and the respon active in their system. A and the question is going to be brought up of question is going to be brought up of question is going to be brought up of I'm going to say it's a NVD gives us a I'm going to say it's a NVD gives us a I'm going to say it's a NVD gives us a score of seven, the vendor gives it a score of seven, the vendor gives it a score of seven, the vendor gives it a score of three. That's a disconnect. So score of three. That's a disconnect. So score of three. That's a disconnect. So how do I prioritize to my senior how do I prioritize to my senior how do I prioritize to my senior leadership saying or more importantly to leadership saying or more importantly to leadership saying or more importantly to my developer senior leadership saying my developer senior leadership saying my developer senior leadership saying you need to prioritize that lack of you need to prioritize that lack of you need to prioritize that lack of standard and lack of consistency. It standard and lack of consistency. It standard and lack of consistency. It gives me more gray hairs than I already gives me more gray hairs than I already gives me more gray hairs than I already have. Now, I understand it's a difficult have. Now, I understand it's a difficult have. Now, I understand it's a difficult question to answer. Curl, the the question to answer. Curl, the the question to answer. Curl, the the developer of Curl, wrote a blog post developer of Curl, wrote a blog post developer of Curl, wrote a blog post called CVSS is dead to us talking about called CVSS is dead to us talking about called CVSS is dead to us talking about this problem because there was a this problem because there was a this problem because there was a vulnerability in curl that was like this vulnerability in curl that was like this vulnerability in curl that was like this terrible 9.8 and the curl developer terrible 9.8 and the curl developer terrible 9.8 and the curl developer said, "Hey, this is wrong and how it's said, "Hey, this is wrong and how it's said, "Hey, this is wrong and how it's really used. This is the impact." So really used. This is the impact." So really used. This is the impact." So these assessments may be very different these assessments may be very different these assessments may be very different on a per platform basis. So we're at on a per platform basis. So we're at on a per platform basis. So we're at least starting that conversation with least starting that conversation with least starting that conversation with the understanding that vulnerabilities the understanding that vulnerabilities the understanding that vulnerabilities may impact platforms differently may impact platforms differently may impact platforms differently depending on the depending on the depending on the platform. Yeah. And we're starting that. platform. Yeah. And we're starting that. platform. Yeah. And we're starting that. So that was the most recent update to So that was the most recent update to So that was the most recent update to the F. Couple other questions. Yeah. I the F. Couple other questions. Yeah. I the F. Couple other questions. Yeah. I have a quick followup. So are you saying have a quick followup. So are you saying have a quick followup. So are you saying that for CVS version 4.0 Oh, we will in that for CVS version 4.0 Oh, we will in that for CVS version 4.0 Oh, we will in NVD have vendor specific CVSS assessment NVD have vendor specific CVSS assessment NVD have vendor specific CVSS assessment along with like when the CV was along with like when the CV was along with like when the CV was initially published has nothing to do initially published has nothing to do initially published has nothing to do with NVD. It's not in NVD. It's not even with NVD. It's not in NVD. It's not even with NVD. It's not in NVD. It's not even unique to CVSS version 4. It is simply unique to CVSS version 4. It is simply unique to CVSS version 4. It is simply the idea the idea the idea that a given CVE may have different that a given CVE may have different that a given CVE may have different impacts depending on the platform that impacts depending on the platform that impacts depending on the platform that where it exists. Okay, that's okay. where it exists. Okay, that's okay. where it exists. Okay, that's okay. Thanks. One Thanks. One Thanks. One more. Yeah. Back here. Yeah. more. Yeah. Back here. Yeah. more. Yeah. Back here. Yeah. And again, this is not And again, this is not And again, this is not CVSS's thing to solve. You know, we are CVSS's thing to solve. You know, we are CVSS's thing to solve. You know, we are not authoritative. We're simply bringing not authoritative. We're simply bringing not authoritative. We're simply bringing to light this this idea. to light this this idea. to light this this idea. Uh yeah. A quick comment from the Uh yeah. A quick comment from the Uh yeah. A quick comment from the sideline and this uh was already sideline and this uh was already sideline and this uh was already implemented in CVRF and CEF where you implemented in CVRF and CEF where you implemented in CVRF and CEF where you can bind uh your CVSS vector to uh the can bind uh your CVSS vector to uh the can bind uh your CVSS vector to uh the specific product. The question that I specific product. The question that I specific product. The question that I have is more schema based. Um so when I have is more schema based. Um so when I have is more schema based. Um so when I looked at the schema and we were trying looked at the schema and we were trying looked at the schema and we were trying to implement that or trying to to implement that or trying to to implement that or trying to incorporate that in in CESF uh we incorporate that in in CESF uh we incorporate that in in CESF uh we realized there is um the threat score realized there is um the threat score realized there is um the threat score and the threat severity as well as the and the threat severity as well as the and the threat severity as well as the environmental score and environmental environmental score and environmental environmental score and environmental severity but I was unable to find how severity but I was unable to find how severity but I was unable to find how those things are computed. uh do you those things are computed. uh do you those things are computed. uh do you have any advice or any guidance on that? have any advice or any guidance on that? have any advice or any guidance on that? um since we want to have a valid schema, um since we want to have a valid schema, um since we want to have a valid schema, we want to want to be able to check um we want to want to be able to check um we want to want to be able to check um that this is the right computation and that this is the right computation and that this is the right computation and at the same point um the environmental at the same point um the environmental at the same point um the environmental vector is often used to tell people hey vector is often used to tell people hey vector is often used to tell people hey this is the base vector from the CVE but this is the base vector from the CVE but this is the base vector from the CVE but in my environment or in in that specific in my environment or in in that specific in my environment or in in that specific environment where I am currently at um environment where I am currently at um environment where I am currently at um that zeros out uh and and it doesn't that zeros out uh and and it doesn't that zeros out uh and and it doesn't affect me for a reason XY Z. Um, so two affect me for a reason XY Z. Um, so two affect me for a reason XY Z. Um, so two questions for you. Now, it's a it's a questions for you. Now, it's a it's a questions for you. Now, it's a it's a complex decision about how to make those complex decision about how to make those complex decision about how to make those determinations. Uh, you know, especially determinations. Uh, you know, especially determinations. Uh, you know, especially with unique threats and environments. I, with unique threats and environments. I, with unique threats and environments. I, you know, I don't specifically we have you know, I don't specifically we have you know, I don't specifically we have some guidance in the examples and we're some guidance in the examples and we're some guidance in the examples and we're trying to work on those. If you have trying to work on those. If you have trying to work on those. If you have suggestions, I would love to hear them. suggestions, I would love to hear them. suggestions, I would love to hear them. Uh, you know, we can add them to our Uh, you know, we can add them to our Uh, you know, we can add them to our examples and our guidance and I'd love examples and our guidance and I'd love examples and our guidance and I'd love to work through that. But no, you know, to work through that. But no, you know, to work through that. But no, you know, I think the SIG can do a better job at I think the SIG can do a better job at I think the SIG can do a better job at helping producers and consumers to make helping producers and consumers to make helping producers and consumers to make those decisions. Uh, and so that's those decisions. Uh, and so that's those decisions. Uh, and so that's something that we're trying to work on. A second comment from an from an A second comment from an from an A second comment from an from an implementers perspective. Um, if you do implementers perspective. Um, if you do implementers perspective. Um, if you do so, we really like that you did a public so, we really like that you did a public so, we really like that you did a public review before. Um, I just looked at the review before. Um, I just looked at the review before. Um, I just looked at the schema not as spec. So that's why I schema not as spec. So that's why I schema not as spec. So that's why I missed the part that uh this that missed the part that uh this that missed the part that uh this that environmental score is not defined or environmental score is not defined or environmental score is not defined or was not defined before. Um if you come was not defined before. Um if you come was not defined before. Um if you come up with a JSON schema uh it would be up with a JSON schema uh it would be up with a JSON schema uh it would be really appreciated if you use the the really appreciated if you use the the really appreciated if you use the the draft 2020 2012 in JSON schema. um as it draft 2020 2012 in JSON schema. um as it draft 2020 2012 in JSON schema. um as it not only brings some additional not only brings some additional not only brings some additional um fields, it also resolves some um fields, it also resolves some um fields, it also resolves some incompatibilities incompatibilities incompatibilities uh with the older versions. Um so makes uh with the older versions. Um so makes uh with the older versions. Um so makes it easier for us to integrate it. Uh so it easier for us to integrate it. Uh so it easier for us to integrate it. Uh so yeah, I know that CESAF is working on uh yeah, I know that CESAF is working on uh yeah, I know that CESAF is working on uh 2.1 that will include uh CVSS version 4. 2.1 that will include uh CVSS version 4. 2.1 that will include uh CVSS version 4. Um, you know, there's a there's a schema Um, you know, there's a there's a schema Um, you know, there's a there's a schema as part of the CVE program and NVD that as part of the CVE program and NVD that as part of the CVE program and NVD that supports these. Uh, I agree that there supports these. Uh, I agree that there supports these. Uh, I agree that there we are all here talking about the we are all here talking about the we are all here talking about the vulnerability information vulnerability information vulnerability information ecosystem. Uh, I think we can do a ecosystem. Uh, I think we can do a ecosystem. Uh, I think we can do a better job collectively about exchanging better job collectively about exchanging better job collectively about exchanging those things. So, yeah, we do need to those things. So, yeah, we do need to those things. So, yeah, we do need to improve on that. Um, and we're we're h improve on that. Um, and we're we're h improve on that. Um, and we're we're h continuing to have those continuing to have those continuing to have those conversations. Was there one more conversations. Was there one more conversations. Was there one more question? Oh question? Oh question? Oh okay. So you know these are all okay. So you know these are all okay. So you know these are all questions that have come up. We are we questions that have come up. We are we questions that have come up. We are we are interested in how to move the the are interested in how to move the the are interested in how to move the the SIG forward. So we launched this survey. SIG forward. So we launched this survey. SIG forward. So we launched this survey. We we have some questions about what We we have some questions about what We we have some questions about what some of the pain points are and adoption some of the pain points are and adoption some of the pain points are and adoption rates and how uh consumers and customers rates and how uh consumers and customers rates and how uh consumers and customers are using CVSS. So in 2000 in 2024 we are using CVSS. So in 2000 in 2024 we are using CVSS. So in 2000 in 2024 we launched this. So we have over 500 launched this. So we have over 500 launched this. So we have over 500 responses. If you're interested in responses. If you're interested in responses. If you're interested in taking the survey, it's in the Discord. taking the survey, it's in the Discord. taking the survey, it's in the Discord. Go check it Go check it Go check it out. So, we're asking primarily about out. So, we're asking primarily about out. So, we're asking primarily about issues and concerns and and how the issues and concerns and and how the issues and concerns and and how the feeling is about CVSS version 4. And feeling is about CVSS version 4. And feeling is about CVSS version 4. And most respondents say they like it. 74% most respondents say they like it. 74% most respondents say they like it. 74% of survey respondents say they have of survey respondents say they have of survey respondents say they have favorable opinion and that that the favorable opinion and that that the favorable opinion and that that the question was, is it worth moving to CVS question was, is it worth moving to CVS question was, is it worth moving to CVS version 4? So, all of them generally, version 4? So, all of them generally, version 4? So, all of them generally, you know, say it's worth it. If they are you know, say it's worth it. If they are you know, say it's worth it. If they are not using CVSS version 4, it's basically not using CVSS version 4, it's basically not using CVSS version 4, it's basically split. So they're not using it. We don't split. So they're not using it. We don't split. So they're not using it. We don't think it's worth it. But among think it's worth it. But among think it's worth it. But among adopters, if you are a consumer on the adopters, if you are a consumer on the adopters, if you are a consumer on the left or producer on the right and you left or producer on the right and you left or producer on the right and you are using CVSS version 4 are using CVSS version 4 are using CVSS version 4 currently, they think it's worth it. you currently, they think it's worth it. you currently, they think it's worth it. you know, the the 85% of organizations know, the the 85% of organizations know, the the 85% of organizations who've adopted version 4 and produced ve who've adopted version 4 and produced ve who've adopted version 4 and produced ve version 4 vector strings think it's version 4 vector strings think it's version 4 vector strings think it's worth worth worth it, but there are challenges that, you it, but there are challenges that, you it, but there are challenges that, you know, we asked about what some of the know, we asked about what some of the know, we asked about what some of the challenges to adoption are. Um, you challenges to adoption are. Um, you challenges to adoption are. Um, you know, it's kind of all over the map. know, it's kind of all over the map. know, it's kind of all over the map. There's there's lagging tool support. We There's there's lagging tool support. We There's there's lagging tool support. We talked about it's not being supported in talked about it's not being supported in talked about it's not being supported in CESAF yet. there. It took a while to get CESAF yet. there. It took a while to get CESAF yet. there. It took a while to get um support in CVE program and NVD right um support in CVE program and NVD right um support in CVE program and NVD right it takes time takes time for internal it takes time takes time for internal it takes time takes time for internal tools to be to be updated right that's tools to be to be updated right that's tools to be to be updated right that's adds adds adds complexity it takes time to move that complexity it takes time to move that complexity it takes time to move that and there's lots of concerns about the and there's lots of concerns about the and there's lots of concerns about the math as well so there's not any one math as well so there's not any one math as well so there's not any one reason that is kind of slowing V4 reason that is kind of slowing V4 reason that is kind of slowing V4 adoption it's a number of things we're adoption it's a number of things we're adoption it's a number of things we're trying to address some of these things trying to address some of these things trying to address some of these things with documentation and advocate for for with documentation and advocate for for with documentation and advocate for for tools and and um you know helping to aid tools and and um you know helping to aid tools and and um you know helping to aid in that but really there's quite a bit in that but really there's quite a bit in that but really there's quite a bit of v4 adoption. Now this is a survey of v4 adoption. Now this is a survey of v4 adoption. Now this is a survey about V4 so most of the respondents about V4 so most of the respondents about V4 so most of the respondents about half said they are using version about half said they are using version about half said they are using version 4. Um so that's maybe not so surprising 4. Um so that's maybe not so surprising 4. Um so that's maybe not so surprising but it is the largest reported um you but it is the largest reported um you but it is the largest reported um you know usage of of of versions of CVSS4 know usage of of of versions of CVSS4 know usage of of of versions of CVSS4 but lots of versions of CVS4 uh lots of but lots of versions of CVS4 uh lots of but lots of versions of CVS4 uh lots of versions of CVSS are being used among versions of CVSS are being used among versions of CVSS are being used among respondents you still version two three respondents you still version two three respondents you still version two three and and and four but it's not just different four but it's not just different four but it's not just different versions of CVSS that's being used it's versions of CVSS that's being used it's versions of CVSS that's being used it's lots of other scoring systems as well lots of other scoring systems as well lots of other scoring systems as well many organizations more than a third use many organizations more than a third use many organizations more than a third use two or more systems as part of their two or more systems as part of their two or more systems as part of their their program. So they're using SSVC, their program. So they're using SSVC, their program. So they're using SSVC, EPSS, the scores and assessments that EPSS, the scores and assessments that EPSS, the scores and assessments that their own vendors provide as well as their own vendors provide as well as their own vendors provide as well as internally developed systems. So CVSS internally developed systems. So CVSS internally developed systems. So CVSS does not work in a vacuum. Most does not work in a vacuum. Most does not work in a vacuum. Most respondents reported using CVSS in respondents reported using CVSS in respondents reported using CVSS in combination with other systems in their combination with other systems in their combination with other systems in their organization. So, we've taken this survey data, some So, we've taken this survey data, some So, we've taken this survey data, some of the answers that we've gotten, and of the answers that we've gotten, and of the answers that we've gotten, and we're trying to make a plan for moving we're trying to make a plan for moving we're trying to make a plan for moving forward. What we're not doing is forward. What we're not doing is forward. What we're not doing is releasing any new standard in any time, releasing any new standard in any time, releasing any new standard in any time, you know, any near future. Version 4 is you know, any near future. Version 4 is you know, any near future. Version 4 is still still fairly fresh. It's been out still still fairly fresh. It's been out still still fairly fresh. It's been out for less than two years. Uh we may do a for less than two years. Uh we may do a for less than two years. Uh we may do a version 4.1 update in the next year or version 4.1 update in the next year or version 4.1 update in the next year or so, uh but certainly not in 2025, maybe so, uh but certainly not in 2025, maybe so, uh but certainly not in 2025, maybe 2026. 2026. 2026. version 4 will be stable for a while. We version 4 will be stable for a while. We version 4 will be stable for a while. We talked about those per product talked about those per product talked about those per product assessments impacting different impacts assessments impacting different impacts assessments impacting different impacts uh of CVA CVEEs per platform. we need to uh of CVA CVEEs per platform. we need to uh of CVA CVEEs per platform. we need to kind of solve and and work on the data kind of solve and and work on the data kind of solve and and work on the data exchange standard for that you know and exchange standard for that you know and exchange standard for that you know and provide legal or regulatory or provide legal or regulatory or provide legal or regulatory or compliance uh reasoning for those compliance uh reasoning for those compliance uh reasoning for those understand but in understand but in understand but in reality there just are different impacts reality there just are different impacts reality there just are different impacts of CVEEs depending on the platforms of of CVEEs depending on the platforms of of CVEEs depending on the platforms of your your your environment and we've been working a lot environment and we've been working a lot environment and we've been working a lot on this what we're calling an enhanced on this what we're calling an enhanced on this what we're calling an enhanced user guide it's an implementation guide user guide it's an implementation guide user guide it's an implementation guide it's about how end consumers owners it's about how end consumers owners it's about how end consumers owners runners of vulnerability management runners of vulnerability management runners of vulnerability management systems can use CVSS in their systems can use CVSS in their systems can use CVSS in their environment can mature the use of CVSS environment can mature the use of CVSS environment can mature the use of CVSS in envir in their environment and kind in envir in their environment and kind in envir in their environment and kind of level up how they're uh doing of level up how they're uh doing of level up how they're uh doing assessments based on vulnerability assessments based on vulnerability assessments based on vulnerability management in their vulnerability management in their vulnerability management in their vulnerability management programs based on CVSS. So you know CVSS is convoluted, CVSS. So you know CVSS is convoluted, CVSS. So you know CVSS is convoluted, it's complicated, it's hard to it's complicated, it's hard to it's complicated, it's hard to understand, but it's what we've got. understand, but it's what we've got. understand, but it's what we've got. We're trying to make it better. If you We're trying to make it better. If you We're trying to make it better. If you want to help us make it more want to help us make it more want to help us make it more complicated, come over. Um, you know, complicated, come over. Um, you know, complicated, come over. Um, you know, you know where to find us. We're always you know where to find us. We're always you know where to find us. We're always looking for more examples, feedback. You looking for more examples, feedback. You looking for more examples, feedback. You know, you have questions about scores, know, you have questions about scores, know, you have questions about scores, about examples, about the standard, you about examples, about the standard, you about examples, about the standard, you can come, you know, reach out to can come, you know, reach out to can come, you know, reach out to us. So, we have a couple maybe a minute us. So, we have a couple maybe a minute us. So, we have a couple maybe a minute left and I'll let you all get to lunch left and I'll let you all get to lunch left and I'll let you all get to lunch if there's any other questions from the room. All right. room. All right. room. All right. Yeah. One more. Just so they hear you. So I apologize. I Just so they hear you. So I apologize. I Just so they hear you. So I apologize. I have not I don't know nearly enough have not I don't know nearly enough have not I don't know nearly enough about the difference between 3.1 or 4.0. about the difference between 3.1 or 4.0. about the difference between 3.1 or 4.0. I know at my company we're either moving I know at my company we're either moving I know at my company we're either moving to it or not moving to it. Are there to it or not moving to it. Are there to it or not moving to it. Are there tangible benefits from your opinion and tangible benefits from your opinion and tangible benefits from your opinion and tangible differences between 3.0, 3.1, tangible differences between 3.0, 3.1, tangible differences between 3.0, 3.1, and 4.0 and even what 4.1 is going to and 4.0 and even what 4.1 is going to and 4.0 and even what 4.1 is going to become where we're going to have to become where we're going to have to become where we're going to have to modify our own internal processes on the modify our own internal processes on the modify our own internal processes on the ingestion of the CVSS scores. ingestion of the CVSS scores. ingestion of the CVSS scores. Uh I I wish you were here about an hour Uh I I wish you were here about an hour Uh I I wish you were here about an hour ago because I have I have this slide for ago because I have I have this slide for ago because I have I have this slide for you. I was next door. I was trying to. you. I was next door. I was trying to. you. I was next door. I was trying to. But hey, the recording will be available But hey, the recording will be available But hey, the recording will be available and the the the presentation is on the and the the the presentation is on the and the the the presentation is on the discord. Uh, you know, take a look. But discord. Uh, you know, take a look. But discord. Uh, you know, take a look. But yes, version 4 is different. I think yes, version 4 is different. I think yes, version 4 is different. I think it's worth it. I think it has more it's worth it. I think it has more it's worth it. I think it has more fidelity. It makes you that has fidelity. It makes you that has fidelity. It makes you that has supplemental metrics. It has um, you supplemental metrics. It has um, you supplemental metrics. It has um, you know, the the split of vulnerability uh, know, the the split of vulnerability uh, know, the the split of vulnerability uh, vulnerable system and subsequent system. vulnerable system and subsequent system. vulnerable system and subsequent system. I think it has some very nice things. I think it has some very nice things. I think it has some very nice things. I'm very proud of it. The numbers are I'm very proud of it. The numbers are I'm very proud of it. The numbers are different. The numbers will change. If different. The numbers will change. If different. The numbers will change. If you're going to move to version 4, you you're going to move to version 4, you you're going to move to version 4, you need to understand how those things are need to understand how those things are need to understand how those things are going to change in your going to change in your going to change in your environment. I have a tool that you can environment. I have a tool that you can environment. I have a tool that you can use if you have information from your use if you have information from your use if you have information from your environment about those scores. You can environment about those scores. You can environment about those scores. You can look at what what some of those changes look at what what some of those changes look at what what some of those changes will be. This is some of the data that I will be. This is some of the data that I will be. This is some of the data that I went through. Um looking at how some of went through. Um looking at how some of went through. Um looking at how some of the the scores will change based on the the scores will change based on the the scores will change based on those data sets depending on the data those data sets depending on the data those data sets depending on the data that's your environment. So, it's going that's your environment. So, it's going that's your environment. So, it's going to change a lot. Uh version four is to change a lot. Uh version four is to change a lot. Uh version four is different. It's not just a drop in different. It's not just a drop in different. It's not just a drop in replacement for for version three. So replacement for for version three. So replacement for for version three. So you need to be forewarned. So Nick, you need to be forewarned. So Nick, you need to be forewarned. So Nick, would you I I guess I'm I'm there. I'm would you I I guess I'm I'm there. I'm would you I I guess I'm I'm there. I'm an educator and I educate people on 3 0 an educator and I educate people on 3 0 an educator and I educate people on 3 0 and 31 all the time and four is and 31 all the time and four is and 31 all the time and four is something we're looking at. I mean my something we're looking at. I mean my something we're looking at. I mean my take is uh the environment's changing. take is uh the environment's changing. take is uh the environment's changing. The the software development environment The the software development environment The the software development environment is changing. 3.0 was fantastic when we is changing. 3.0 was fantastic when we is changing. 3.0 was fantastic when we bought software off the shelf before bought software off the shelf before bought software off the shelf before GitHub before open source really kind of GitHub before open source really kind of GitHub before open source really kind of has gone the direction it's gone in. I has gone the direction it's gone in. I has gone the direction it's gone in. I my take is and just my summary on I my take is and just my summary on I my take is and just my summary on I didn't see the previously so I'm going didn't see the previously so I'm going didn't see the previously so I'm going to watch the replay but um that's you to watch the replay but um that's you to watch the replay but um that's you know it takes more into account there know it takes more into account there know it takes more into account there and and and and and and so you know that's where I think the so you know that's where I think the so you know that's where I think the real the value is and but I'll just real the value is and but I'll just real the value is and but I'll just point out the blue box in the upper point out the blue box in the upper point out the blue box in the upper right hand corner my notice I noticed right hand corner my notice I noticed right hand corner my notice I noticed the scores increased so which was kind the scores increased so which was kind the scores increased so which was kind of scary. of scary. of scary. All right. Thanks everybody. I'll be in All right. Thanks everybody. I'll be in All right. Thanks everybody. I'll be in here the rest of the day for other CVSs here the rest of the day for other CVSs here the rest of the day for other CVSs talks. We'll see you later.
