I've done uh cyber riskmanagement guru. I've done uh cyber riskmanagement guru. I've done uh stuff at the cabinet level. uh done uh stuff at the cabinet level. uh done uh stuff at the cabinet level. uh done uh testimony at for Congress, worked with testimony at for Congress, worked with testimony at for Congress, worked with NIST, uh did a stint with SIZA, wrote a NIST, uh did a stint with SIZA, wrote a NIST, uh did a stint with SIZA, wrote a book on cyber risk management, and book on cyber risk management, and book on cyber risk management, and currently, as Nick noted, I am currently, as Nick noted, I am currently, as Nick noted, I am volunteering in the uh the CVSS SIG volunteering in the uh the CVSS SIG volunteering in the uh the CVSS SIG where we're uh working on the CVSS where we're uh working on the CVSS where we're uh working on the CVSS standard. So, that's kind of me in a standard. So, that's kind of me in a standard. So, that's kind of me in a nutshell. Um UC2 and wrist ruler, I'm nutshell. Um UC2 and wrist ruler, I'm nutshell. Um UC2 and wrist ruler, I'm sure, are foreign terms to everyone. Um, sure, are foreign terms to everyone. Um, sure, are foreign terms to everyone. Um, UC2 is short for uniform confidence and UC2 is short for uniform confidence and UC2 is short for uniform confidence and certainty. It is a estimation certainty. It is a estimation certainty. It is a estimation methodology and toolkit that I put methodology and toolkit that I put methodology and toolkit that I put together after my SIZA stint where I was together after my SIZA stint where I was together after my SIZA stint where I was working on critical working on critical working on critical infrastructure and uh risk management infrastructure and uh risk management infrastructure and uh risk management there. When I joined the CVSS SIG, I saw there. When I joined the CVSS SIG, I saw there. When I joined the CVSS SIG, I saw um a uh an immediate uh or what I felt um a uh an immediate uh or what I felt um a uh an immediate uh or what I felt was an immediate uh overlap between the was an immediate uh overlap between the was an immediate uh overlap between the two or joint between the two. Um so I two or joint between the two. Um so I two or joint between the two. Um so I put the UC2 put the UC2 put the UC2 uh risk ruler that is like a it's like a uh risk ruler that is like a it's like a uh risk ruler that is like a it's like a slim down version of the larger UC2 uh slim down version of the larger UC2 uh slim down version of the larger UC2 uh methodology. I put that together with methodology. I put that together with methodology. I put that together with CVSS and that's how we arrived at this CVSS and that's how we arrived at this CVSS and that's how we arrived at this UC2 risk ruler for CVSS and there are a UC2 risk ruler for CVSS and there are a UC2 risk ruler for CVSS and there are a couple of uh links down here uh that you couple of uh links down here uh that you couple of uh links down here uh that you can follow uh if you want more can follow uh if you want more can follow uh if you want more information on those. I also posted information on those. I also posted information on those. I also posted those papers uh on the Discord server as those papers uh on the Discord server as those papers uh on the Discord server as well as the whole slide deck that we're well as the whole slide deck that we're well as the whole slide deck that we're going through right now. going through right now. going through right now. Um, so, uh, just as a way to introduce Um, so, uh, just as a way to introduce Um, so, uh, just as a way to introduce what's going on here, kind of the what's going on here, kind of the what's going on here, kind of the purpose of this UC2 risk ruler for CVSS purpose of this UC2 risk ruler for CVSS purpose of this UC2 risk ruler for CVSS is to augment the numeric scores with a is to augment the numeric scores with a is to augment the numeric scores with a visualization of the underlying visualization of the underlying visualization of the underlying precision, confidence, and maturity of precision, confidence, and maturity of precision, confidence, and maturity of the score. Um, as everyone's probably the score. Um, as everyone's probably the score. Um, as everyone's probably well aware, CVSS has really nice uh well aware, CVSS has really nice uh well aware, CVSS has really nice uh numeric value scores. uh but there is no numeric value scores. uh but there is no numeric value scores. uh but there is no mechanism in those uh numeric values to mechanism in those uh numeric values to mechanism in those uh numeric values to convey the maturity or completeness of convey the maturity or completeness of convey the maturity or completeness of the metrics that lie behind that score. the metrics that lie behind that score. the metrics that lie behind that score. So the objective here is to use this So the objective here is to use this So the objective here is to use this risk ruler as a way to enable more risk ruler as a way to enable more risk ruler as a way to enable more transparent and defensible cyber transparent and defensible cyber transparent and defensible cyber security decisions. And some of the be security decisions. And some of the be security decisions. And some of the be key benefits include of course enhanced key benefits include of course enhanced key benefits include of course enhanced prioritization but probably more prioritization but probably more prioritization but probably more important is the improved communication important is the improved communication important is the improved communication that is a result of this. that allows us that is a result of this. that allows us that is a result of this. that allows us to uh talk with people that maybe don't to uh talk with people that maybe don't to uh talk with people that maybe don't have a a solid grounding in CVSS about have a a solid grounding in CVSS about have a a solid grounding in CVSS about these scores and what they these scores and what they these scores and what they mean. Um before I get uh further into mean. Um before I get uh further into mean. Um before I get uh further into that, I want to stop and talk a little that, I want to stop and talk a little that, I want to stop and talk a little bit about CVSS4 and its metric groups. bit about CVSS4 and its metric groups. bit about CVSS4 and its metric groups. Uh there are four main categories. Uh there are four main categories. Uh there are four main categories. There's base, threat, environmental, and There's base, threat, environmental, and There's base, threat, environmental, and supplemental metrics. Uh they're all supplemental metrics. Uh they're all supplemental metrics. Uh they're all laid out in a what we call a vector laid out in a what we call a vector laid out in a what we call a vector string. And there's a although it's in string. And there's a although it's in string. And there's a although it's in tiny type there's a vector string tiny type there's a vector string tiny type there's a vector string example at the very bottom of the screen example at the very bottom of the screen example at the very bottom of the screen here. And then I've broken that out uh here. And then I've broken that out uh here. And then I've broken that out uh into those different metric groups. And into those different metric groups. And into those different metric groups. And as you can see there's uh usually well as you can see there's uh usually well as you can see there's uh usually well threat only has one metric but the other threat only has one metric but the other threat only has one metric but the other ones have uh multiple metrics within ones have uh multiple metrics within ones have uh multiple metrics within them. Uh and the first 11 are required. them. Uh and the first 11 are required. them. Uh and the first 11 are required. These are the base metrics that a vendor These are the base metrics that a vendor These are the base metrics that a vendor like Cisco, Intel, Juniper, whomever is like Cisco, Intel, Juniper, whomever is like Cisco, Intel, Juniper, whomever is going to be setting based on their view going to be setting based on their view going to be setting based on their view of a vulnerability in one of their of a vulnerability in one of their of a vulnerability in one of their systems. And it's important that you systems. And it's important that you systems. And it's important that you understand this is from the viewpoint of understand this is from the viewpoint of understand this is from the viewpoint of the vendor who does not who is incapable the vendor who does not who is incapable the vendor who does not who is incapable of seeing every single deployment in of seeing every single deployment in of seeing every single deployment in their customer base. Nor do they have their customer base. Nor do they have their customer base. Nor do they have the ability to uh to predict what threat the ability to uh to predict what threat the ability to uh to predict what threat metrics are going to uh I mean, excuse metrics are going to uh I mean, excuse metrics are going to uh I mean, excuse me. uh how the threat landscape is going me. uh how the threat landscape is going me. uh how the threat landscape is going to evolve over time. So so the vendor to evolve over time. So so the vendor to evolve over time. So so the vendor starts us off with a set of be uh base starts us off with a set of be uh base starts us off with a set of be uh base metrics that allows us to set a CVSS metrics that allows us to set a CVSS metrics that allows us to set a CVSS score and then that is supposed to be score and then that is supposed to be score and then that is supposed to be matured uh with these additional metrics matured uh with these additional metrics matured uh with these additional metrics um once that uh score is ingested in the um once that uh score is ingested in the um once that uh score is ingested in the field. So, uh, we'll take a look at this field. So, uh, we'll take a look at this field. So, uh, we'll take a look at this CVSS, CVSS, CVSS, uh, maturity model, which is in draft uh, maturity model, which is in draft uh, maturity model, which is in draft right now. Uh, I don't think it's going right now. Uh, I don't think it's going right now. Uh, I don't think it's going to change a whole lot, but hopefully to change a whole lot, but hopefully to change a whole lot, but hopefully it'll get a lot prettier than this, uh, it'll get a lot prettier than this, uh, it'll get a lot prettier than this, uh, when it's finally released. But when it's finally released. But when it's finally released. But essentially, what happens here is just essentially, what happens here is just essentially, what happens here is just as I was describing earlier, you know, as I was describing earlier, you know, as I was describing earlier, you know, when if you start at level one, you're when if you start at level one, you're when if you start at level one, you're you're really just looking at base you're really just looking at base you're really just looking at base metrics. And then as you move to level metrics. And then as you move to level metrics. And then as you move to level two, three, and four, this indicates two, three, and four, this indicates two, three, and four, this indicates that you're adding threat intelligence. that you're adding threat intelligence. that you're adding threat intelligence. You're adding threat and and um uh You're adding threat and and um uh You're adding threat and and um uh additional information about your additional information about your additional information about your environment like how well is it environment like how well is it environment like how well is it firewalled off and that kind of thing as firewalled off and that kind of thing as firewalled off and that kind of thing as well as some supplemental metrics at well as some supplemental metrics at well as some supplemental metrics at each level uh gives us more confidence each level uh gives us more confidence each level uh gives us more confidence that that score is not is is correct for that that score is not is is correct for that that score is not is is correct for your environment. Um so but this talk your environment. Um so but this talk your environment. Um so but this talk isn't about the CVSS maturity model but isn't about the CVSS maturity model but isn't about the CVSS maturity model but it is important because the risk ruler it is important because the risk ruler it is important because the risk ruler does um uh align with this. So most does um uh align with this. So most does um uh align with this. So most notably uh the risk ruler uh basically notably uh the risk ruler uh basically notably uh the risk ruler uh basically follows this maturity model but does so follows this maturity model but does so follows this maturity model but does so from bottom to top rather than top to from bottom to top rather than top to from bottom to top rather than top to bottom as I showed on the previous bottom as I showed on the previous bottom as I showed on the previous screen. So we start down at the bottom. screen. So we start down at the bottom. screen. So we start down at the bottom. If you're not using CVSS at all, then If you're not using CVSS at all, then If you're not using CVSS at all, then you have no idea what the CVSS score is you have no idea what the CVSS score is you have no idea what the CVSS score is going to be. Obviously, uh it can be going to be. Obviously, uh it can be going to be. Obviously, uh it can be anywhere in a range from 0 to 10 because anywhere in a range from 0 to 10 because anywhere in a range from 0 to 10 because that's the range of scores that CVSS that's the range of scores that CVSS that's the range of scores that CVSS emits. But as we get up uh another level emits. But as we get up uh another level emits. But as we get up uh another level to our base metrics, we all of a sudden to our base metrics, we all of a sudden to our base metrics, we all of a sudden realize that hey, you know what? um from realize that hey, you know what? um from realize that hey, you know what? um from our point of view and and then I say our our point of view and and then I say our our point of view and and then I say our because I'm putting myself in the because I'm putting myself in the because I'm putting myself in the standpoint of a consumer not just a a standpoint of a consumer not just a a standpoint of a consumer not just a a vendor then when CVS uh a score is vendor then when CVS uh a score is vendor then when CVS uh a score is released it could actually be a range of released it could actually be a range of released it could actually be a range of that once we've added on all of our that once we've added on all of our that once we've added on all of our threat and environmental and threat and environmental and threat and environmental and supplemental metrics but we don't know supplemental metrics but we don't know supplemental metrics but we don't know what that is going to be until we add what that is going to be until we add what that is going to be until we add those. But we can give kind of an those. But we can give kind of an those. But we can give kind of an estimate of where that's going to to to estimate of where that's going to to to estimate of where that's going to to to land. And all of this comes out of my land. And all of this comes out of my land. And all of this comes out of my UC2 uh methodology, which again I'm not UC2 uh methodology, which again I'm not UC2 uh methodology, which again I'm not going to go too deep into that. And then going to go too deep into that. And then going to go too deep into that. And then the next level up uh you have five the next level up uh you have five the next level up uh you have five different categories. These are actually different categories. These are actually different categories. These are actually defined explicitly in the CBSS defined explicitly in the CBSS defined explicitly in the CBSS specification. So, uh, they align with specification. So, uh, they align with specification. So, uh, they align with what the standard says each score should what the standard says each score should what the standard says each score should be if you're trying to translate them be if you're trying to translate them be if you're trying to translate them from a numeric score into a uh from a numeric score into a uh from a numeric score into a uh qualitative bin, right, of of low, qualitative bin, right, of of low, qualitative bin, right, of of low, medium, high, or or none. And uh then as medium, high, or or none. And uh then as medium, high, or or none. And uh then as we move up yet another notch, then we we move up yet another notch, then we we move up yet another notch, then we get to a point where we can essentially get to a point where we can essentially get to a point where we can essentially drop the decimal point and just look at drop the decimal point and just look at drop the decimal point and just look at the 11 buckets 0 through 10 into which a the 11 buckets 0 through 10 into which a the 11 buckets 0 through 10 into which a score would fall. And then at the very score would fall. And then at the very score would fall. And then at the very top we have the very precise score which top we have the very precise score which top we have the very precise score which is maybe a 8.3 or something like that. is maybe a 8.3 or something like that. is maybe a 8.3 or something like that. Uh so that's kind of the risk ruler in a Uh so that's kind of the risk ruler in a Uh so that's kind of the risk ruler in a nutshell. that's designed to say, okay, nutshell. that's designed to say, okay, nutshell. that's designed to say, okay, you know, we recognize that there are you know, we recognize that there are you know, we recognize that there are numeric values going on in in a in an in numeric values going on in in a in an in numeric values going on in in a in an in a uh a metric of some sort or a measure a uh a metric of some sort or a measure a uh a metric of some sort or a measure of some sort. And how do we translate of some sort. And how do we translate of some sort. And how do we translate that or interpret that when we have only that or interpret that when we have only that or interpret that when we have only a few different options that we can do a few different options that we can do a few different options that we can do with uh with uh with the outcome? So with uh with uh with the outcome? So with uh with uh with the outcome? So um before I move into a more concrete um before I move into a more concrete um before I move into a more concrete example, I want to note that uh for all example, I want to note that uh for all example, I want to note that uh for all the quants in the audience that are the quants in the audience that are the quants in the audience that are looking at all this qualitative stuff looking at all this qualitative stuff looking at all this qualitative stuff and rolling your eyes, uh there is and rolling your eyes, uh there is and rolling your eyes, uh there is something in here for you. Uh it's very something in here for you. Uh it's very something in here for you. Uh it's very explicit. When I designed the explicit. When I designed the explicit. When I designed the methodology, it was designed methodology, it was designed methodology, it was designed specifically to to allow some uh uh specifically to to allow some uh uh specifically to to allow some uh uh interoperability between quantitative interoperability between quantitative interoperability between quantitative and qualitative measures. So the ranges and qualitative measures. So the ranges and qualitative measures. So the ranges that you saw in that risk register uh that you saw in that risk register uh that you saw in that risk register uh can be used for instance in a per can be used for instance in a per can be used for instance in a per distribution to give you your min and distribution to give you your min and distribution to give you your min and max values. Um and from that you can max values. Um and from that you can max values. Um and from that you can also derive a most likely value. And also derive a most likely value. And also derive a most likely value. And what happens is you end up with what happens is you end up with what happens is you end up with probability distributions like this that probability distributions like this that probability distributions like this that then feed into like a stochastic model. then feed into like a stochastic model. then feed into like a stochastic model. Uh probably one of the most well-known Uh probably one of the most well-known Uh probably one of the most well-known being fair although that is hardly the being fair although that is hardly the being fair although that is hardly the only quantitative model out there. So, only quantitative model out there. So, only quantitative model out there. So, I'm not going to go into that because I'm not going to go into that because I'm not going to go into that because that's a whole subject into itself, but that's a whole subject into itself, but that's a whole subject into itself, but just know that the risk ruler does give just know that the risk ruler does give just know that the risk ruler does give that option to move into the that option to move into the that option to move into the quantitative quantitative quantitative realm. Um, so the uh the example that I realm. Um, so the uh the example that I realm. Um, so the uh the example that I put together here is a fictitious put together here is a fictitious put together here is a fictitious vulnerability XYZ has a really high base vulnerability XYZ has a really high base vulnerability XYZ has a really high base score as set by a vendor and that's uh score as set by a vendor and that's uh score as set by a vendor and that's uh 8.6. And then uh after we mature that 8.6. And then uh after we mature that 8.6. And then uh after we mature that score by adding a different me uh score by adding a different me uh score by adding a different me uh different metrics and so forth that it different metrics and so forth that it different metrics and so forth that it comes down to a comes down to a comes down to a 4.2. So you got these two scores that 4.2. So you got these two scores that 4.2. So you got these two scores that are wildly different on the scale of CVS are wildly different on the scale of CVS are wildly different on the scale of CVS and we need some way to like think about and we need some way to like think about and we need some way to like think about this and more importantly how do we this and more importantly how do we this and more importantly how do we present these scores in the context of present these scores in the context of present these scores in the context of leadership and that's where the risk leadership and that's where the risk leadership and that's where the risk ruler really shines is it's designed to ruler really shines is it's designed to ruler really shines is it's designed to show very visually show very visually show very visually um the the precision maturity and um the the precision maturity and um the the precision maturity and confidence that lays behind those confidence that lays behind those confidence that lays behind those scores. So uh if we map this to the risk scores. So uh if we map this to the risk scores. So uh if we map this to the risk ruler, we start on the right hand side. ruler, we start on the right hand side. ruler, we start on the right hand side. We see the CVSS base score of 8.6, but We see the CVSS base score of 8.6, but We see the CVSS base score of 8.6, but we know that that is a base score. So we we know that that is a base score. So we we know that that is a base score. So we drop down to uh the maturity level one drop down to uh the maturity level one drop down to uh the maturity level one uh which is the second row up from the uh which is the second row up from the uh which is the second row up from the bottom. And we see that this lands bottom. And we see that this lands bottom. And we see that this lands clearly in the high, but it also glances clearly in the high, but it also glances clearly in the high, but it also glances through the median. So here you have through the median. So here you have through the median. So here you have kind of a you know there can be some kind of a you know there can be some kind of a you know there can be some discussion. And do we interpret this 8.6 discussion. And do we interpret this 8.6 discussion. And do we interpret this 8.6 as being something for our own as being something for our own as being something for our own installation or our own environment? Is installation or our own environment? Is installation or our own environment? Is it going to ultimately land between 7 it going to ultimately land between 7 it going to ultimately land between 7 and 10 or is it going to go as be a much and 10 or is it going to go as be a much and 10 or is it going to go as be a much larger range from 0.1 all the way up to larger range from 0.1 all the way up to larger range from 0.1 all the way up to 10? And we can, you know, you can have 10? And we can, you know, you can have 10? And we can, you know, you can have that discussion and you can have some that discussion and you can have some that discussion and you can have some rules set around, you know, how do you rules set around, you know, how do you rules set around, you know, how do you how do you resolve that discrepancy? The how do you resolve that discrepancy? The how do you resolve that discrepancy? The best thing to do, of course, is just to best thing to do, of course, is just to best thing to do, of course, is just to combine the two ranges together. And and combine the two ranges together. And and combine the two ranges together. And and then it also shows this also shows how, then it also shows this also shows how, then it also shows this also shows how, you know, you can only get a couple you know, you can only get a couple you know, you can only get a couple maybe three different options uh for how maybe three different options uh for how maybe three different options uh for how you interpret this score at that level. you interpret this score at that level. you interpret this score at that level. But if we come up two more levels with But if we come up two more levels with But if we come up two more levels with threat and environmental metrics threat and environmental metrics threat and environmental metrics defined, then all of a sudden the score defined, then all of a sudden the score defined, then all of a sudden the score changes and we have that 4.2. changes and we have that 4.2. changes and we have that 4.2. And because that is very clearly higher And because that is very clearly higher And because that is very clearly higher in confidence, then we're able to say, in confidence, then we're able to say, in confidence, then we're able to say, "Yeah, you know what? The range on this "Yeah, you know what? The range on this "Yeah, you know what? The range on this is going to be solidly within the four is going to be solidly within the four is going to be solidly within the four camp. Maybe it's a 4.0, maybe it's a 46, camp. Maybe it's a 4.0, maybe it's a 46, camp. Maybe it's a 4.0, maybe it's a 46, maybe it's a 49, but we know it's maybe it's a 49, but we know it's maybe it's a 49, but we know it's solidly going to be in four." And I solidly going to be in four." And I solidly going to be in four." And I picked this example on purpose to show picked this example on purpose to show picked this example on purpose to show how we would explicitly stop here and how we would explicitly stop here and how we would explicitly stop here and not necessarily chase after the not necessarily chase after the not necessarily chase after the supplemental metrics because in this supplemental metrics because in this supplemental metrics because in this case the fictitious example here, we've case the fictitious example here, we've case the fictitious example here, we've already decided that 11 bins of action already decided that 11 bins of action already decided that 11 bins of action are enough for us to prioritize our are enough for us to prioritize our are enough for us to prioritize our vulnerabilities. We don't really need to vulnerabilities. We don't really need to vulnerabilities. We don't really need to go out to the decimal level. we've got go out to the decimal level. we've got go out to the decimal level. we've got enough information and that's part of enough information and that's part of enough information and that's part of this whole objective of the risk ruler, this whole objective of the risk ruler, this whole objective of the risk ruler, right? We could have even backed up to right? We could have even backed up to right? We could have even backed up to the lower level and said, "Hey, we've the lower level and said, "Hey, we've the lower level and said, "Hey, we've just going to do base and threat. That just going to do base and threat. That just going to do base and threat. That gets us into, you know, five different gets us into, you know, five different gets us into, you know, five different buckets and that's gracious plenty for buckets and that's gracious plenty for buckets and that's gracious plenty for what we want to do." Um but again the what we want to do." Um but again the what we want to do." Um but again the whole goal of the risk uh ruler here is whole goal of the risk uh ruler here is whole goal of the risk uh ruler here is to show how numeric scores can map down to show how numeric scores can map down to show how numeric scores can map down in a consistent way to qualitative in a consistent way to qualitative in a consistent way to qualitative scores and more importantly show the scores and more importantly show the scores and more importantly show the confidence and certainty that we have confidence and certainty that we have confidence and certainty that we have around those uh figures. around those uh figures. around those uh figures. So in summary uh we add a critical layer So in summary uh we add a critical layer So in summary uh we add a critical layer of context to CVSS scores uh scores by of context to CVSS scores uh scores by of context to CVSS scores uh scores by visualizing precision, confidence and visualizing precision, confidence and visualizing precision, confidence and maturity. This enhances decision making. maturity. This enhances decision making. maturity. This enhances decision making. It helps tremendously with model It helps tremendously with model It helps tremendously with model sensitivity analysis and other things sensitivity analysis and other things sensitivity analysis and other things and in the quant camp that we really and in the quant camp that we really and in the quant camp that we really didn't talk about today and also didn't talk about today and also didn't talk about today and also supports uh more transparent and supports uh more transparent and supports uh more transparent and defensible cyber security solutions. So defensible cyber security solutions. So defensible cyber security solutions. So at the end of the day, this UC2 risk at the end of the day, this UC2 risk at the end of the day, this UC2 risk ruler for CVSS acts as a bridge between ruler for CVSS acts as a bridge between ruler for CVSS acts as a bridge between precise quantitative scores and precise quantitative scores and precise quantitative scores and qualitative actionable risk insights. qualitative actionable risk insights. qualitative actionable risk insights.

Everyone to a discussion that we can have and maybe that will um, you can have and maybe that will um, you can have and maybe that will um, you know, they'll they'll think about it. know, they'll they'll think about it. know, they'll they'll think about it. Um, I've been looking at this for a Um, I've been looking at this for a Um, I've been looking at this for a little while since you shared it with little while since you shared it with little while since you shared it with the SIG and, you know, asked for the SIG and, you know, asked for the SIG and, you know, asked for feedback and I think seeing the example feedback and I think seeing the example feedback and I think seeing the example finally brought it together for me, you finally brought it together for me, you finally brought it together for me, you know, understanding. I thought this was know, understanding. I thought this was know, understanding. I thought this was related to not having any trust in your related to not having any trust in your related to not having any trust in your vendors, but really it's comparing those vendors, but really it's comparing those vendors, but really it's comparing those things between would you say it's fair things between would you say it's fair things between would you say it's fair to that it's comparing the the base to that it's comparing the the base to that it's comparing the the base score from your vendor to the enrichment score from your vendor to the enrichment score from your vendor to the enrichment that you do in your own organization and that you do in your own organization and that you do in your own organization and then making a decision between those. then making a decision between those. then making a decision between those. Exactly. Exactly. It's it's about it's Exactly. Exactly. It's it's about it's Exactly. Exactly. It's it's about it's not measuring your confidence in your not measuring your confidence in your not measuring your confidence in your vendor. uh your vendor only has a you vendor. uh your vendor only has a you vendor. uh your vendor only has a you know a a they only have so much vision know a a they only have so much vision know a a they only have so much vision right they can only see so far and so right they can only see so far and so right they can only see so far and so deep into their supply chain so it's deep into their supply chain so it's deep into their supply chain so it's about the confidence that what the about the confidence that what the about the confidence that what the vendor is saying is the same as what you vendor is saying is the same as what you vendor is saying is the same as what you are going to interpret the same are going to interpret the same are going to interpret the same vulnerability in situation in your own vulnerability in situation in your own vulnerability in situation in your own environment that make sense Nick environment that make sense Nick environment that make sense Nick yeah now we talked talked a lot about yeah now we talked talked a lot about yeah now we talked talked a lot about where I'm going to talk later about our where I'm going to talk later about our where I'm going to talk later about our implementation guide, the enhanced user implementation guide, the enhanced user implementation guide, the enhanced user guide where we have this term guide where we have this term guide where we have this term operationalization. operationalization. operationalization. How can this be? And it may be different How can this be? And it may be different How can this be? And it may be different for every for every for every organization, organization, organization, but are you offering any ways but are you offering any ways but are you offering any ways to do this in an to do this in an to do this in an automated s you know systematic way or automated s you know systematic way or automated s you know systematic way or is this up to the individual is this up to the individual is this up to the individual organizations in their vulnerability organizations in their vulnerability organizations in their vulnerability management program to incorporate it? management program to incorporate it? management program to incorporate it? Yeah, so good question. So the the the Yeah, so good question. So the the the Yeah, so good question. So the the the risk ruler itself does not offer uh risk ruler itself does not offer uh risk ruler itself does not offer uh automation of CVSS score of CVSS scoring automation of CVSS score of CVSS scoring automation of CVSS score of CVSS scoring right. So I know that we are in the SIG right. So I know that we are in the SIG right. So I know that we are in the SIG working on uh some advice on how to do working on uh some advice on how to do working on uh some advice on how to do that for instance uh ingesting uh threat that for instance uh ingesting uh threat that for instance uh ingesting uh threat intelligence from open sources um in intelligence from open sources um in intelligence from open sources um in order to get to at least that second order to get to at least that second order to get to at least that second level of maturity level of maturity level of maturity uh in a very automated way. Um but what uh in a very automated way. Um but what uh in a very automated way. Um but what this really this particular tool is this really this particular tool is this really this particular tool is designed to do is to you know foster designed to do is to you know foster designed to do is to you know foster communication when and and and uh so for communication when and and and uh so for communication when and and and uh so for instance and you've got uh an 8.6 six instance and you've got uh an 8.6 six instance and you've got uh an 8.6 six vulnerability and you have an auditor vulnerability and you have an auditor vulnerability and you have an auditor breathing down your neck saying, you breathing down your neck saying, you breathing down your neck saying, you know, why aren't you, you know, taking know, why aren't you, you know, taking know, why aren't you, you know, taking care of this vulnerability? Why aren't care of this vulnerability? Why aren't care of this vulnerability? Why aren't you patching this thing? And you're you patching this thing? And you're you patching this thing? And you're like, okay, look, that's really not what like, okay, look, that's really not what like, okay, look, that's really not what that is in our environment because we that is in our environment because we that is in our environment because we have all these things. and you can break have all these things. and you can break have all these things. and you can break this risk ruler out and and begin to this risk ruler out and and begin to this risk ruler out and and begin to have that that conversation about look, have that that conversation about look, have that that conversation about look, you know, here's why here's why from the you know, here's why here's why from the you know, here's why here's why from the vendor standpoint it, you know, it falls vendor standpoint it, you know, it falls vendor standpoint it, you know, it falls into this high category because they into this high category because they into this high category because they can't see all these other metrics that can't see all these other metrics that can't see all these other metrics that we can see. And as you pile those we can see. And as you pile those we can see. And as you pile those metrics on, then your your uh your metrics on, then your your uh your metrics on, then your your uh your ability to narrow down and become much ability to narrow down and become much ability to narrow down and become much more precise with a score for your more precise with a score for your more precise with a score for your organization comes clearly there. And so organization comes clearly there. And so organization comes clearly there. And so as much as anything, it's to help as much as anything, it's to help as much as anything, it's to help communicate in situations like that communicate in situations like that communicate in situations like that where people don't quite understand why where people don't quite understand why where people don't quite understand why why you'd have two scores and and how do why you'd have two scores and and how do why you'd have two scores and and how do those relate to one another. Make sense? those relate to one another. Make sense? those relate to one another. Make sense? That's a great suggestion. I think like That's a great suggestion. I think like That's a great suggestion. I think like you said, this is a great framework for you said, this is a great framework for you said, this is a great framework for having discussions about CVSS having discussions about CVSS having discussions about CVSS enrichment, about understanding how enrichment, about understanding how enrichment, about understanding how vulnerabilities impact individual vulnerabilities impact individual vulnerabilities impact individual environments. environments. environments. That's yeah absolutely and it's you know That's yeah absolutely and it's you know That's yeah absolutely and it's you know and it drives funding discussions as and it drives funding discussions as and it drives funding discussions as well you know because you know to ingest well you know because you know to ingest well you know because you know to ingest the base score doesn't really cost a the base score doesn't really cost a the base score doesn't really cost a whole lot right because this score is whole lot right because this score is whole lot right because this score is given by the vendor essentially for free given by the vendor essentially for free given by the vendor essentially for free right you download it off the internet right you download it off the internet right you download it off the internet and you use it but to incorporate the and you use it but to incorporate the and you use it but to incorporate the threat uh metrics now you have to spend threat uh metrics now you have to spend threat uh metrics now you have to spend a little more time or effort trying to a little more time or effort trying to a little more time or effort trying to you know rejigger the the score or you know rejigger the the score or you know rejigger the the score or rescore the vulner vulnerability for rescore the vulner vulnerability for rescore the vulner vulnerability for yourself and then when you get into yourself and then when you get into yourself and then when you get into environmental, you know, you're you're environmental, you know, you're you're environmental, you know, you're you're putting a substantial amount of effort putting a substantial amount of effort putting a substantial amount of effort into that. Well, all of that has a cost into that. Well, all of that has a cost into that. Well, all of that has a cost with it. And essentially what you're with it. And essentially what you're with it. And essentially what you're doing with this is you're showing doing with this is you're showing doing with this is you're showing leadership. You're like, look, if you leadership. You're like, look, if you leadership. You're like, look, if you just want me to go on a high, medium, a just want me to go on a high, medium, a just want me to go on a high, medium, a low basis, great. I can do that. But if low basis, great. I can do that. But if low basis, great. I can do that. But if you want me to get more nuanced and and you want me to get more nuanced and and you want me to get more nuanced and and better and and provide a, you know, a better and and provide a, you know, a better and and provide a, you know, a much more welloiled vulnerability much more welloiled vulnerability much more welloiled vulnerability program, we need to step up our level of program, we need to step up our level of program, we need to step up our level of confidence in the scores and not just confidence in the scores and not just confidence in the scores and not just relying on the vendor score, but on relying on the vendor score, but on relying on the vendor score, but on scores that are tailored to our scores that are tailored to our scores that are tailored to our environment. And I think that story gets environment. And I think that story gets environment. And I think that story gets uh spoken here quite well. uh spoken here quite well. uh spoken here quite well. Yeah, it's a very very good visual aid. Yeah, it's a very very good visual aid. Yeah, it's a very very good visual aid. We have a question in the room. We're We have a question in the room. We're We have a question in the room. We're running a mic over. One moment. Sure. Um, so I'm thinking I would frame the Um, so I'm thinking I would frame the Um, so I'm thinking I would frame the question. question. question. Can you hear me? I can. Um, on the base Can you hear me? I can. Um, on the base Can you hear me? I can. Um, on the base level, uh, second row up on the chart level, uh, second row up on the chart level, uh, second row up on the chart that's shown on the screen. I may have that's shown on the screen. I may have that's shown on the screen. I may have missed it as you were describing this. missed it as you were describing this. missed it as you were describing this. Can you explain um the the meaning Can you explain um the the meaning Can you explain um the the meaning behind the colors and the overlap, how behind the colors and the overlap, how behind the colors and the overlap, how how medium is overlapping with high and how medium is overlapping with high and how medium is overlapping with high and low? Is that just um the the lack of of low? Is that just um the the lack of of low? Is that just um the the lack of of confidence as you described it in kind confidence as you described it in kind confidence as you described it in kind of the subjectivity of where that score of the subjectivity of where that score of the subjectivity of where that score might land without the added um uh might land without the added um uh might land without the added um uh attributes from from the the layers attributes from from the the layers attributes from from the the layers above? Yes. Yes. Exactly. It's it's above? Yes. Yes. Exactly. It's it's above? Yes. Yes. Exactly. It's it's this nod to a couple of different this nod to a couple of different this nod to a couple of different things. all of that. It's a nod to um things. all of that. It's a nod to um things. all of that. It's a nod to um you know there's there's there's a when you know there's there's there's a when you know there's there's there's a when you when you're using numeric scores and you when you're using numeric scores and you when you're using numeric scores and you know onetenth of a point is enough you know onetenth of a point is enough you know onetenth of a point is enough to switch something from you know a two to switch something from you know a two to switch something from you know a two to a three that that's called boundary to a three that that's called boundary to a three that that's called boundary sensitivity. And so uh it causes a lot sensitivity. And so uh it causes a lot sensitivity. And so uh it causes a lot of angst about around people that are of angst about around people that are of angst about around people that are very rigid with the way they interpret very rigid with the way they interpret very rigid with the way they interpret math. Um and and so this is kind of a math. Um and and so this is kind of a math. Um and and so this is kind of a nod to that situation like right like nod to that situation like right like nod to that situation like right like you can't have a precise boundary if you you can't have a precise boundary if you you can't have a precise boundary if you don't have a whole lot of confidence don't have a whole lot of confidence don't have a whole lot of confidence that that score hasn't you know enough that that score hasn't you know enough that that score hasn't you know enough like if you think about a target like a like if you think about a target like a like if you think about a target like a like a you know archery target right like a you know archery target right like a you know archery target right like if you don't have enough rings um like if you don't have enough rings um like if you don't have enough rings um to to clearly define what the bullseye to to clearly define what the bullseye to to clearly define what the bullseye is and you've just got a blank you know is and you've just got a blank you know is and you've just got a blank you know circle out there that you're shooting at circle out there that you're shooting at circle out there that you're shooting at it's kind of hard to figure out, you it's kind of hard to figure out, you it's kind of hard to figure out, you know, where the bullseye is. Um, and so know, where the bullseye is. Um, and so know, where the bullseye is. Um, and so it's kind of that concept that's being it's kind of that concept that's being it's kind of that concept that's being baked in here. Um, uh, and I Does that baked in here. Um, uh, and I Does that baked in here. Um, uh, and I Does that answer your question? Am I going in the answer your question? Am I going in the answer your question? Am I going in the right direction for you? Yes. Got a right direction for you? Yes. Got a right direction for you? Yes. Got a thumbs up. Okay, great. We had a discussion yesterday uh closing We had a discussion yesterday uh closing We had a discussion yesterday uh closing remarks from some of the organizers remarks from some of the organizers remarks from some of the organizers about the about the about the vulnerability ecosystem, the vulnerability ecosystem, the vulnerability ecosystem, the vulnerability disclosure, vulnerability vulnerability disclosure, vulnerability vulnerability disclosure, vulnerability management, vulnerability ecosystem. management, vulnerability ecosystem. management, vulnerability ecosystem. And how do you think this fits into the And how do you think this fits into the And how do you think this fits into the vulnerability management or vulnerability management or vulnerability management or vulnerability disclosure ecosystem and vulnerability disclosure ecosystem and vulnerability disclosure ecosystem and can help with the deluge of information can help with the deluge of information can help with the deluge of information and possibly the unreliability of and possibly the unreliability of and possibly the unreliability of information that's available from information that's available from information that's available from vendors that is trying to be used by vendors that is trying to be used by vendors that is trying to be used by individual organizations to make these individual organizations to make these individual organizations to make these riskbased decisions. riskbased decisions. riskbased decisions. Yeah. So, um I think this again is is Yeah. So, um I think this again is is Yeah. So, um I think this again is is really a communication tool. Um this is really a communication tool. Um this is really a communication tool. Um this is what the UC2 risk ruler for CVSS is. what the UC2 risk ruler for CVSS is. what the UC2 risk ruler for CVSS is. It's a it's a way to say okay, you know, It's a it's a way to say okay, you know, It's a it's a way to say okay, you know, here's here's what the vendors are here's here's what the vendors are here's here's what the vendors are providing. It's kind of a um uh a you providing. It's kind of a um uh a you providing. It's kind of a um uh a you know, not super granular kind of uh know, not super granular kind of uh know, not super granular kind of uh score, but you know, we can start adding score, but you know, we can start adding score, but you know, we can start adding things on. And so like threat things on. And so like threat things on. And so like threat intelligence, like if you if you're just intelligence, like if you if you're just intelligence, like if you if you're just if you're just pulling in your your if you're just pulling in your your if you're just pulling in your your vendor scores and you're not adding any vendor scores and you're not adding any vendor scores and you're not adding any uh threat intelligence on top of it, uh threat intelligence on top of it, uh threat intelligence on top of it, you're kind of doing yourself a you're kind of doing yourself a you're kind of doing yourself a disservice. And this is this is a good disservice. And this is this is a good disservice. And this is this is a good example of saying, you know, okay, if we example of saying, you know, okay, if we example of saying, you know, okay, if we want to do if we want to move our level want to do if we want to move our level want to do if we want to move our level of confidence up so that we're not just of confidence up so that we're not just of confidence up so that we're not just doing high, medium, and low, but we're doing high, medium, and low, but we're doing high, medium, and low, but we're doing five levels of qualitative, doing five levels of qualitative, doing five levels of qualitative, quantitative bin. Um, it starts to quantitative bin. Um, it starts to quantitative bin. Um, it starts to justify that additional expense and um justify that additional expense and um justify that additional expense and um and and it kind of paints the direction and and it kind of paints the direction and and it kind of paints the direction for where your organization needs to go. for where your organization needs to go. for where your organization needs to go. In fact, I wish I had a slide up here In fact, I wish I had a slide up here In fact, I wish I had a slide up here right now that I don't have, which is right now that I don't have, which is right now that I don't have, which is one that traces a score like the 4.2 one that traces a score like the 4.2 one that traces a score like the 4.2 down through each level, and it actually down through each level, and it actually down through each level, and it actually creates almost like um uh a hurricane uh creates almost like um uh a hurricane uh creates almost like um uh a hurricane uh cone, like a a tracking cone, right? Uh cone, like a a tracking cone, right? Uh cone, like a a tracking cone, right? Uh it's saying that look, if you really it's saying that look, if you really it's saying that look, if you really want to know where that the eye of that want to know where that the eye of that want to know where that the eye of that storm is going to pass, then you need to storm is going to pass, then you need to storm is going to pass, then you need to have a lot more confidence than you do have a lot more confidence than you do have a lot more confidence than you do on a weather report that's like 6 days on a weather report that's like 6 days on a weather report that's like 6 days out or 7 days out. You need the kind of out or 7 days out. You need the kind of out or 7 days out. You need the kind of confidence that you've got in 24 hours confidence that you've got in 24 hours confidence that you've got in 24 hours or 8 hours of storm warning. And what is or 8 hours of storm warning. And what is or 8 hours of storm warning. And what is that going to take? So um from that that going to take? So um from that that going to take? So um from that standpoint I think this risk ruler will standpoint I think this risk ruler will standpoint I think this risk ruler will help uh the larger ecosystem sit down help uh the larger ecosystem sit down help uh the larger ecosystem sit down and and have these critical discussions and and have these critical discussions and and have these critical discussions to say what what is the level of to say what what is the level of to say what what is the level of confidence uh that we need to get to in confidence uh that we need to get to in confidence uh that we need to get to in these scores working with the vendors these scores working with the vendors these scores working with the vendors and maturing that that score so that we and maturing that that score so that we and maturing that that score so that we can make sure that we're making really can make sure that we're making really can make sure that we're making really good decisions out on the out in the good decisions out on the out in the good decisions out on the out in the field. decisions not just about not field. decisions not just about not field. decisions not just about not getting hacked but also good financial getting hacked but also good financial getting hacked but also good financial decisions as well. So, one more question. One one more question from the room. But One one more question from the room. But One one more question from the room. But yes, and I'm and you are saying the the yes, and I'm and you are saying the the yes, and I'm and you are saying the the dirty R word, but uh I'm sorry. dirty R word, but uh I'm sorry. dirty R word, but uh I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Forgiven for now. It's baked I'm sorry. Forgiven for now. It's baked I'm sorry. Forgiven for now. It's baked into me. Thanks, Rob, for the into me. Thanks, Rob, for the into me. Thanks, Rob, for the presentation. It certainly um does open presentation. It certainly um does open presentation. It certainly um does open up for consumers, and I come from the up for consumers, and I come from the up for consumers, and I come from the the producer side as a vendor. Yeah, my the producer side as a vendor. Yeah, my the producer side as a vendor. Yeah, my question comes from you're helping question comes from you're helping question comes from you're helping narrow down into those impact ratings, narrow down into those impact ratings, narrow down into those impact ratings, risk ratings of a risk ratings of a risk ratings of a vulnerability. Do you have any concern vulnerability. Do you have any concern vulnerability. Do you have any concern with vendors and we are one such vendor with vendors and we are one such vendor with vendors and we are one such vendor that assigns their own criticality on that assigns their own criticality on that assigns their own criticality on their scores when they send them out in their scores when they send them out in their scores when they send them out in an advisory? an advisory? an advisory? So, well, Cisco, we will say it's an 8.6 So, well, Cisco, we will say it's an 8.6 So, well, Cisco, we will say it's an 8.6 and we'll say it's a high, but then and we'll say it's a high, but then and we'll say it's a high, but then along to the risk ruler, the risk ruler along to the risk ruler, the risk ruler along to the risk ruler, the risk ruler puts it down. Do you feel that the puts it down. Do you feel that the puts it down. Do you feel that the vendor is doing a disservice by slapping vendor is doing a disservice by slapping vendor is doing a disservice by slapping one of those risk words on that score? one of those risk words on that score? one of those risk words on that score? Or do you still think there's value in Or do you still think there's value in Or do you still think there's value in having that despite the risk ruler most having that despite the risk ruler most having that despite the risk ruler most likely showing it being lower once all likely showing it being lower once all likely showing it being lower once all of the efficacy is put into it from a of the efficacy is put into it from a of the efficacy is put into it from a consumer? No, I think I think honestly consumer? No, I think I think honestly consumer? No, I think I think honestly you get a lot of transparency in your you get a lot of transparency in your you get a lot of transparency in your numbers because if you just like in this numbers because if you just like in this numbers because if you just like in this example here, like if you as a vendor example here, like if you as a vendor example here, like if you as a vendor tell me you've got a vulnerability that tell me you've got a vulnerability that tell me you've got a vulnerability that you've scored as an 8.6, I know that you've scored as an 8.6, I know that you've scored as an 8.6, I know that you've done that based on a reasonable you've done that based on a reasonable you've done that based on a reasonable worst case scenario, right? Which, you worst case scenario, right? Which, you worst case scenario, right? Which, you know, may not be the scenario that I'm know, may not be the scenario that I'm know, may not be the scenario that I'm faced with. And the reason I'm not faced faced with. And the reason I'm not faced faced with. And the reason I'm not faced with that is because I've got all these with that is because I've got all these with that is because I've got all these other controls. I've got, you know, other controls. I've got, you know, other controls. I've got, you know, seven layers of firewall. I got jump seven layers of firewall. I got jump seven layers of firewall. I got jump hosts. I got all these other things in hosts. I got all these other things in hosts. I got all these other things in place to help mitigate uh the situation. place to help mitigate uh the situation. place to help mitigate uh the situation. So, um you know what you're saying here So, um you know what you're saying here So, um you know what you're saying here with if you published your 8.6 six and with if you published your 8.6 six and with if you published your 8.6 six and you put it on this risk ruler, you're you put it on this risk ruler, you're you put it on this risk ruler, you're saying, "Look, this is most likely going saying, "Look, this is most likely going saying, "Look, this is most likely going to be in a high bucket, meaning it could to be in a high bucket, meaning it could to be in a high bucket, meaning it could go from 10 to to, you know, from seven go from 10 to to, you know, from seven go from 10 to to, you know, from seven to 10, but you know, but the reality is to 10, but you know, but the reality is to 10, but you know, but the reality is if you will look more closely at your if you will look more closely at your if you will look more closely at your environment, you might be able to drag environment, you might be able to drag environment, you might be able to drag that thing down to a one." Um, but that thing down to a one." Um, but that thing down to a one." Um, but that's it. It puts the burden back on so that's it. It puts the burden back on so that's it. It puts the burden back on so it puts the burden back on your customer it puts the burden back on your customer it puts the burden back on your customer base to take uh responsibility for their base to take uh responsibility for their base to take uh responsibility for their own deployment, right? Um and it also own deployment, right? Um and it also own deployment, right? Um and it also gives you and and I hate to say the the gives you and and I hate to say the the gives you and and I hate to say the the even dirtier word, the lawyers, uh the even dirtier word, the lawyers, uh the even dirtier word, the lawyers, uh the ability to say, you know what, uh we did ability to say, you know what, uh we did ability to say, you know what, uh we did come out with this score, but we gave come out with this score, but we gave come out with this score, but we gave the guidance of this risk ruler the guidance of this risk ruler the guidance of this risk ruler alongside of it. So, you know, just alongside of it. So, you know, just alongside of it. So, you know, just because we said that it was a five and because we said that it was a five and because we said that it was a five and it turns out that it was a really nasty it turns out that it was a really nasty it turns out that it was a really nasty uh vulnerability for one particular uh vulnerability for one particular uh vulnerability for one particular client, we say, "Look, yeah, we said it client, we say, "Look, yeah, we said it client, we say, "Look, yeah, we said it was a medium, but you see here the range was a medium, but you see here the range was a medium, but you see here the range could have been anywhere between 0.1 and could have been anywhere between 0.1 and could have been anywhere between 0.1 and 8.9, and if the client didn't do their 8.9, and if the client didn't do their 8.9, and if the client didn't do their due diligence, then we're not due diligence, then we're not due diligence, then we're not responsible for the outcome of that." responsible for the outcome of that." responsible for the outcome of that." So, you know, just I think the I think So, you know, just I think the I think So, you know, just I think the I think the lawyers would appreciate this as the lawyers would appreciate this as the lawyers would appreciate this as much as anybody else, I guess. Great. much as anybody else, I guess. Great. much as anybody else, I guess. Great. Thank you. Sure. Thank you. Sure. Thank you. Sure.
