### **[Vulnerability Root Cause Mapping with CWE](markdown/TH1tGO15K24_Vulnerability_Root_Cause_Mapping_with_CWE.md)** - [Watch Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH1tGO15K24)
  **Speakers:** Alec Summers Chris Madden Alec Summers (The MITRE Corporation, US), Chris Madden (Yahoo Product Security Team	, IE)
  **When:** April 7, 2025 11:30-12:30
  **Abstract:**
  > Root cause mapping is the identification of the underlying cause(s) of a vulnerability. This is best done by correlating CVE Records and/or bug or vulnerability tickets with CWE entries. Accurate root cause mapping is valuable because it directly illuminates where investments, policy, and practices can address the root causes responsible for vulnerabilities so that they can be eliminated. This enables trend analysis where a valuable feedback loop into SDLC or architecture design planning can help remove of whole classes of vulnerabilities in organizations’ products. However, widespread adoption of root cause mapping has been elusive due to several challenges including CWE usability, completeness, the diversity of terminology interpretation, and organizational resource constraints, to name a few.
  > 
  > This presentation touches on the value of root cause mapping and recognizes recent adoption in the CNA community, before exploring what is being done to address existing challenges and develop practical solutions. Additionally, we evaluate the performance of a grounded large language model (LLM) tool against the CWE Top 25 Most Dangerous Software Weaknesses dataset. The comparative analysis sheds light on the viability of advancements in LLM capabilities in helping to scale decentralized root cause mapping throughout the vulnerability management ecosystem, offering actionable insights for practitioners and researchers alike.

### **[BOF: Vulnerability Data Consumers](markdown/GyFyXvmlxHY_BOF_%20Vulnerability%20Data%20Consumers.md)** - [Watch Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyFyXvmlxHY)
  **Speakers:** Jay Jacobs Jay Jacobs (Empirical Security , US)
  **When:** April 7, 2025 12:30-13:00
  **Abstract:**
  > Do you reference and lookup multiple CVEs during your typical day? Let's get together and talk about it. This is a "birds of a feather" session dedicated to the data consumers (as opposed to the CNAs) -- those of us who end  up trying to decipher what exactly that vulnerability description means, trying to figure out which CVSS is more trustworthy and which way is up within CWEs. Bring your challenges, successes and everything in between because your voice and feedback are the focal point of this roundtable discussion!

### **[The Enriched CVE Record: Redefining Completeness and Quality for Greater Impact](markdown/1zvqpba2ka8_The%20Enriched%20CVE%20Record_%20Redefining%20Completeness%20and%20Quality%20for%20Greater%20Impact.md)** - [Watch Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zvqpba2ka8)
  **Speakers:** Alec Summers Alec Summers (The MITRE Corporation, US)
  **When:** April 7, 2025 14:30-15:00
  **Abstract:**
  > As the CVE Program marks its 25th anniversary, the CVE Record has evolved dramatically. What once defined a complete CVE Record — a CVE ID, a description, and a public reference — is now the foundation on which a CNA can provide valuable additional information at the time of issuing an advisory. Today, completeness means more, with structured metadata including CVSS, CWE, CPE, and others that enhance vulnerability management efforts across PSIRTs, researchers, and other downstream CVE data consumers across the vulnerability management ecosystem. In April 2024, the CVE Program launched an initiative to encourage CNAs – those closest to the products themselves – to provide this additional information directly to the CVE Program, rather than wait for downstream partners to do so. Generally, CNAs have access to the most reliable source for accurate determinations for such data enrichment and are therefore best positioned to do it. And, getting more accurate and precise information in the hands of the defenders and downstream customers on a timelier basis helps the vulnerability management ecosystem and the entire cybersecurity community in addressing risks.
  > 
  > This session will cover what CVE Record completeness means today and reflect on the results of the first year of the CVE Program’s data enrichment initiative. We’ll examine how the increasing adoption of record enrichment by CNAs and ADPs has set the stage for the next frontier: a renewed focus on data quality and precision. This presentation will provide a forward-looking perspective on how the CVE Program can drive meaningful improvements in vulnerability management data quality as we enter its next 25 years.

### **[Don’t Forget the Little Guy: Vulnerability Management in Operational Technology](markdown/PfMsj0NvS-A_Don’t%20Forget%20the%20Little%20Guy_%20Vulnerability%20Management%20in%20Operational%20Technology.md)** - [Watch Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfMsj0NvS-A)
  **Speakers:** Alex Assante (Network and Security Technologies	, US), Kylie McClanahan (Bastazo, US)
  **When:** April 7, 2025 09:30-10:30
  **Abstract:**
  > What comes after coordinated vulnerability disclosure (CVD)? When the issue is confirmed and the advisory is published, what comes next?
  > 
  > Vulnerability management is a mature and robust—if imperfect—process in information technology (IT). The same process, though, poses unique challenges for engineers, technicians, and security teams in operational technology (OT) environments. The difficulties faced in the OT space may not be widely known or understood by vulnerability researchers and IT security professionals. Understanding these differences is key to securing operational environments, which, along with being ever more connected, are also increasingly interdependent with IT systems.
  > 
  > Kylie and Alex will present a view of vulnerability management in OT environments, examining this process in practice at electric utilities. Their presentation will include current approaches, the regulatory requirements specific to the space, data needs, and the unique challenges posed by OT environments."

### **[Diagnosing the Hurdles in the Medical Device Regulatory Landscape](markdown/jnmcX07pMMw_Diagnosing_the_Hurdles_in_the_Medical_Device_Regulatory_Landscape.md)** - [Watch Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnmcX07pMMw)
  **Speakers:** Ethan Muntz (Health-ISAC	, US), Taylor Porter (Health-ISAC	, US)
  **When:** April 7, 2025 11:30-12:00
  **Abstract:**
  > Recent high-profile cybersecurity incidents impacting critical infrastructure have brought the issue of insufficient cybersecurity into the foreground for legislators all around the world. Legal discussions in this space were amplified by the mass implementation of AI into modern technologies. As nations grapple with evolving cybersecurity challenges posed by increasingly sophisticated adversaries and the integration of new technologies, medical device manufacturers have had to adapt to new legislative frameworks to remain compliant.
  > 
  > Through its premarket submissions, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the use of 1,000 medical devices with AI-incorporated features between 1995 and 2024. The majority of these devices were approved within the past five years. With the integration of AI comes the concern of managing AI risk and its potential vulnerabilities. The FDA has released Considerations for the Use of Artificial Intelligence to Support Regulatory Decision-Making for Drug and Biological Products, providing guidance for submitting AI-enabled medical devices to the FDA before public sale in the US. Medical device manufacturers must also consider the EU regulations when entering the global market, notably the EU AI Act. The EU AI Act is the first legislation in the world to determine acceptable and unacceptable use cases of AI. Given that healthcare and life sciences are quite sensitive, AI integration into these systems falls under the high-risk category, making manufacturers comply with numerous standards before selling their products in the EU. As AI continues to become more prevalent within the healthcare sector, more regulations surrounding its implementation will likely be submitted. Therefore, the regulatory landscape will likely become more tumultuous as AI becomes a mainstream technology. Healthcare organizations should prioritize adopting a flexible compliance strategy in the wake of an increasingly dynamic regulatory landscape.

### **[Securing the Future: Navigating AI Vulnerabilities and Evolving Security Practices](markdown/7FwUNeAT4y8_Securing_the_Future__Navigating_AI_Vulnerabilities_and_Evolving_Security_Practices.md)** - [Watch Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FwUNeAT4y8)
  **Speakers:** Lisa Bradley Sarah Evans Lisa Bradley (Dell, US), Sarah Evans (Dell, US)
  **When:** April 7, 2025 12:00-12:30
  **Abstract:**
  > As artificial intelligence (AI) becomes increasingly integrated into software products, it introduces new types of vulnerabilities that challenge traditional security practices. This talk will explore how AI-specific vulnerabilities, such as adversarial attacks and model poisoning, necessitate changes in product security vulnerability response. This talk will also propose areas of the AI supply chain that will need to evolve to improve vulnerability management.

  **Speakers:** Art Manion Jay Jacobs Art Manion (ANALYGENCE Labs, US), Jay Jacobs (Empirical Security , US)
  **When:** April 7, 2025 09:30-10:00
  **Abstract:**
  > Vulnerability databases come in all shapes and sizes and contain a variety of information elements. Some elements overlap across databases, other elements do not and database records can vary in size depending for example on how many references are included or how much software status (“affected”) is provided. These databases and their elements are intended to support vulnerability management which we organize into four phases: discovery, prioritization, mitigation, and feedback. Which data elements contribute to these phases? More importantly, which are required to enable the first essential phase of discovery? A Minimum Viable Vulnerability Enumeration (MVVE) is the smallest possible number of information elements required to discover (identify and disambiguate) a vulnerability. Without an MVVE element, discovery, and therefore vulnerability management in its entirety, are not possible. This talk will define phases of vulnerability management and how information elements support those phases, with a strong focus on the MVVE necessary for the essential first discovery phase. We map the MVVE to a few well-known vulnerability databases, including CVE.

  **Abstract:**
  > Putting safe harbour law to the test in practice, the Belgian Federal Government opened selected digital assets to ethical hackers to search for bugs over a 2-week period.
  > 
  > How is this different from bug bounties? Ethical hackers had to use their own identities to test for vulnerabilities, follow the strict legal guidelines as set
  > in our CVDP law, and navigate the complexities of collaborating and competing with each other (strangers who quickly became allies) in a never-been-done-before event.
  > 
  > This presentation will outline the process from idea to execution and beyond. You will learn the groundwork that must be done to host your own event, success factors, and the essential "magic" that brings a disparate group together as a community wanting to be useful to society. And we will reveal the results - which are more than the numbers of vulnerabilities found.

  **Speakers:** Benjamin Edwards Sander Vinberg Benjamin Edwards (Bitsight, US), Sander Vinberg (Bitsight, US)
  **When:** April 8, 2025 11:30-12:30
  **Abstract:**
  > Assessing vulnerability “risk” is challenging and the subject of vigorous research. The focus is generally on two broadly defined components of risk: “likelihood of exploitation” and “impact”. In this data-driven, visually compelling talk, we argue that despite being broadly defined, they are often narrowly examined and there are other measures that vulnerability management teams can and should consider. We explore the sophistication of the attackers, exploitation impact, the type of software involved, and the difficulty of remediation using Internet-scale scanning data and unique cyber threat intelligence.
  > 
  > We then shift perspective away from organizational risk to systematic risk, examining vulnerability footprints and vulnerability risk concentration in the global supply chain. We conclude by synthesizing some of these results to show that localized vulnerability risk is the product of a combination of local and global forces. Our results enable organizations to focus even more sharply on specific vulnerabilities and disregard others that may otherwise appear grave, adding precision to the problem of strategic vulnerability remediation.

  **When:** April 8, 2025 10:00-10:30
  **Abstract:**
  > To perform various security activities like vulnerability management, license compliance or support model verification, software and hardware customers must rely on various metadata like CSAF, VEX or SBOM data. Unfortunately together with the market expansion it’s getting harder to easily find out and verify specific product lifecycles, especially in a machine readable format and easily accessible way. Almost all vendors publish their products' lifecycle data definitions, but there is no standardization around format and delivery method.
  > 
  > In this talk we will focus on both technical and non-technical aspects of precise product identification, product versioning, support model including target dates. We will discuss how significantly it can help customers with various lifecycle or support scope regulatory requirements and security implications.

  **Abstract:**
  > Regulation (EU) 2024/2847, commonly known as the European Cyber Resilience Act, is a landmark piece of regulation focused on protecting consumers purchasing "products with digital elements" within the European Union. Articles 13 & 14 and Annex I lay out many requirements that manufacturers must begin following starting in 2025 with the full law going into effect in 2027.
  > 
  > But what is the TL/DR that PSIRT teams need to be aware of and start implementing today so that their organizations can demonstrate compliance tomorrow? Ideally with a few alterations and some new documentation, much of what the law tells us must be done are common tasks your vulnerability management program has already proven capable of delivering.

  **Speakers:** Luci Stanescu (Canonical	, RO)
  **When:** April 8, 2025 16:00-17:00
  **Abstract:**
  > "Information security standards and regulations are constantly gaining more traction and adoption, in an effort to counter-balance the expanding cybercriminal “business sector”. However, these are, understandably, often devised on the assumption that they will be implemented within enterprises, which are centrally managed and have well-defined boundaries. Nevertheless, open source software has become ubiquitous within enterprise infrastructure and consumer products, with little consideration given by regulators or standards bodies.
  > 
  > With open source projects acting as suppliers, often with a governance structure that’s not defined in detail, the question of the suitability of cybersecurity regulations and industry standards within the OSS context becomes increasingly relevant. While organisations such the Open Source Security Foundation (OpenSSF) are making a huge difference by providing best practices, tools and information, these would also need to be recognised by regulators and standards bodies in order to bridge the gap with the enterprises’ burdens. This talk explores the beneficial aspects that can be learned from regulations and standards to further improve the security posture of OSS projects, as well as the requirements which are difficult to map in this context."

  **Speakers:** Jay Jacobs Jay Jacobs (Empirical Security , US)
  **When:** April 8, 2025 14:00-15:00
  **Abstract:**
  > The Exploit Prediction Scoring System (EPSS) is a data-driven effort for estimating the likelihood (probability) that a software vulnerability will be exploited in the wild. Since its launch in 2019, EPSS has gone through four major versions. The most recent iteration has expanded the visibility within EPSS by adding more sources for exploitation in the wild and more details about published vulnerabilities. The result is a better model that will improve both the efficiency and coverage of your vulnerability prioritization efforts. Come listen to the lead author and SIG co-chair talk about the evolution of EPSS and the changes in the most recent EPSS release… and definitely bring your questions!

  **Speakers:** Rob Arnold (Acorn Pass, US)
  **When:** April 8, 2025 09:00-10:00
  **Abstract:**
  > The UC2 Risk Ruler enhances the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) version 4.0 by integrating confidence levels into vulnerability scores, offering a visual representation that aligns numeric scores with qualitative severity labels and data reliability. While CVSS 4.0 offers  standardized quantitative scores mapped to qualitative labels, it lacks a built-in mechanism for representing confidence in the underlying data quality, impacting  decision accuracy. The UC2 Risk Ruler addresses this gap by aligning CVSS scores with distinct confidence levels—High, Medium, Low, and Unknown—enabling stakeholders to assess the reliability of vulnerability scores in addition to  severity. This framework assists decision-makers by reducing "false precision" in low-confidence data, promoting transparency, and facilitating clear communication across technical and non-technical teams. Practical applications include aiding leadership in determining adequate certainty levels for defensible  decisions and allowing teams to gauge model sensitivity to confidence adjustments, ultimately refining vulnerability  management and supporting robust cybersecurity strategies.

  **Speakers:** Nick Leali Nick Leali (Cisco and CVSS SIG Chair, US)
  **When:** April 8, 2025 11:00-12:00
  **Abstract:**
  > CVSS v4.0 has been with us for a little over a year, and quite a bit of data exists out there to tell us about how vulnerability scores may change between CVSS v3.1 and v4.0 assessments.
  > 
  > If you are concerned about the impact that adopting CVSS v4.0 will have on your environment, interested in learning about how the numbers may change, or if you want to craft a narrative using math to either push for v4.0 adoption or avoid it entirely, then this talk is for you! I will go through an analysis of the changes between CVSS v3.1 and v4.0 scores, giving you the context necessary for understanding how adoption may impact vulnerability disclosure and vulnerability management.
  > 
  > In addition to the numbers, we'll discuss some of the shortcomings of CVSS v4.0 and how you can use the standard to its full extent. You can even use the tool I developed to create this talk to look at CVSS v3.1 and v4.0 data in your own environment!

  **When:** April 8, 2025 16:00-16:30
  **Abstract:**
  > In this white paper we analyze the inconsistencies between CVSS v3 and v4 as well as within scores assigned to the same vulnerability. We also review the odds that you may meet them in NVD or other datasets such as VulDB, internal datasets of companies and among those used by CVSS SIG subject matter experts. We tried to see if ChatGPT can help but to no avail, as it is learning those very inconsistent scores in the wild. By reviewing the standards, we propose a set of technical rules-of-thumb that enable simultaneous scoring of CVSS v3.1 and v4, offering a practical step towards mitigating inconsistencies.

  **Speakers:** Shelby Cunningham Shelby Cunningham (GitHub, US)
  **When:** April 8, 2025 16:30-17:00
  **Abstract:**
  > Version 4.0 of the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) introduces a new metric, exploit maturity, that scores where on the path from public claim to active exploitation a particular vulnerability rests. By choosing from the options of "Unreported" (the least serious status), "POC" (a somewhat serious status), and "Attacked" (the most serious status), you can use CVSS alone to indicate to readers whether a vulnerability has been exploited in the wild and adjust the overall severity score accordingly. This talk will show the audience how the addition of one metric with three straightforward severity levels can improve your severity assessments in multiple situations. Whether a vulnerability is at risk of overscoring and you indicate via a less serious exploit maturity metric that there is less to fear or a vulnerability is exploited in the wild and you want a brief and simple means to express that fact, using exploit maturity in CVSSv4 scores makes your data richer and more precise.

  **Speakers:** Michael Lieberman (Kusari, US)
  **When:** April 9, 2025 11:00-11:30
  **Abstract:**
  > Secure supply chains are like a great lunch: assembling the right pieces in the right order is the difference between success and failure. A sandwich has bread and a variety of fillings. A secure supply chain has analysis of a variety of information.
  > 
  > This talk covers using tools like GUAC, osv-scanner, and others to ingest, enrich, and analyze software production focused tools and frameworks: SLSA, OpenSSF Scorecard, SBOMs, and more. Combined with security consumption frameworks like S2C2F, the organization hungry for a secure supply chain can prove compliance and mitigate risks like software vulnerabilities. Building software supply chain security architectures and putting the pieces together are key to building the open source security sandwich.

  **Speakers:** Vincent Danen Vincent Danen (Red Hat	, CA)
  **When:** April 9, 2025 11:30-12:00
  **Abstract:**
  > Open source software isn’t just allowed in most enterprises—it’s often the go-to choice. Yet while procurement policies have evolved to embrace open source, risk acceptance frameworks haven’t kept pace. We tend to treat security concerns like monsters under the bed, wanting them to vanish, but there's a key difference between how we view open source vs. proprietary software. In fact, open source’s very strengths are often weaponized against it, creating a double standard. Join me as we explore the paradox of risk tolerance, security equity, and the overlooked biases shaping the conversation around open source and proprietary software. Let’s level the playing field and rethink how we define and manage risk.

  **When:** April 9, 2025 15:30-16:00
  **Abstract:**
  > The open-source software ecosystem continues to steadily expand, with millions of packages across repositories. However, this growth is not matched by a corresponding increase in maintainers, leading to challenges in package sustainability and opening the door to potential issues in vulnerability management. To help address these issues, open-source distributions can act as a "Vulnerability Responder of Last Resort" for under-maintained packages, providing community guidance and helping to process reports. Also discussed is the particular impact of vulnerability reports on packages facing these challenges.

  **Speakers:** D’Nae Ferguson Kyle Kilian D’Nae Ferguson (RAND Corporation, US), Kyle Kilian (RAND Corporation, US)
  **When:** April 9, 2025 09:00-09:30
  **Abstract:**
  > The current software vulnerability ecosystem is composed of multiple standards that facilitate unique identification, naming, scoring and patching of software vulnerabilities. This ecosystem supports, among other things, vulnerability disclosure, coordination, and bug bounty programs. While there are efforts to adapt these disclosure programs to account for AI vulnerabilities, it is unclear whether vulnerabilities in ‘AI models’ are of a similar ‘type’ as traditional software vulnerabilities. Clearly, vulnerabilities in AI/ML software packages (e.g. python’s spacy) warrant CVEs, but it is unclear whether vulnerabilities that exploit tendencies of LLMs to hallucinate, or attacks that rely on the chaining of AI models in agentic-AI systems should also be classified as a CVE. Further, while taxonomies also exist for classifying AI/ML incidents, attacks, and types of weaknesses, these efforts don’t, themselves, assign specific vulnerabilities to specific models. The purpose of this discussion, therefore, is to consider how we should identify, enumerate, and assign vulnerabilities in AI models.

  **When:** April 9, 2025 11:00-12:00
  **Abstract:**
  > Modern vulnerability management relies on precise software component identification, yet our ecosystem has evolved multiple competing and overlapping identification schemes. This talk examines the fragmentation and interoperability challenges across identification systems including CPE, purl, and affected component references in the CVE and OSV record schemas. We'll analyze real-world examples of how different CNAs approach component identification, highlighting inconsistencies that complicate vulnerability tracking. We'll explore the complexity of mapping between upstream releases and downstream packages in major Linux distributions. The session concludes with recommendations for improving component identification standardization and coordination across the vulnerability management ecosystem.
  > 
  > This talk will benefit vulnerability management teams,  security researchers, package maintainers, and vulnerability database operators who need to accurately track and correlate vulnerable components across different  contexts and systems.

### **[Lessons from OSV: Vulnerability Management for Open Source](markdown/qHcpKW2nOqI_Lessons%20from%20OSV_%20Vulnerability%20Management%20for%20Open%20Source.md)** - [Watch Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHcpKW2nOqI)
  **Speakers:** Oliver Chang (Google	, AU)
  **When:** April 9, 2025 15:30-16:30
  **Abstract:**
  > The OSV (Open Source Vulnerabilities) project was started 4 years ago in 2021. Today, it's a widely adopted standard and vulnerability database for open source now used by GitHub, Canonical, Red Hat, and many open source ecosystems covering a total of 28 open source ecosystems.
  > 
  > This talk goes into the guiding principles behind the OSV format, the lessons we learned when designing it, as well as the challenges of gaining adoption across the various open source ecosystems. We'll also go into the kinds of metadata that turned out to be critical for helping consumers identify and fix vulnerabilities in their dependencies, as well as for running an end-to-end vulnerability management programs at large organisations. Finally, we'll talk about our thoughts and plans for how to  make VEX scale and work for the open source ecosystem in an accurate and automated way.

### **[Breaking the Build: How Attackers Abuse GitHub Actions](markdown/Ia5HUSyTrU0_Breaking%20the%20Build_%20How%20Attackers%20Abuse%20GitHub%20Actions.md)** - [Watch Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia5HUSyTrU0)
  **Speakers:** Jonathan Evans (GitHub, US)
  **When:** April 9, 2025 09:00-09:30
  **Abstract:**
  > GitHub Actions has become a go-to automation tool for developers on GitHub, enabling seamless CI/CD workflows. But this automation does not come without risk. Misconfigurations, excessive permissions, and untrusted third-party actions can expose repositories to severe threats—ranging from secrets exfiltration to full repository compromise.
  > 
  > This talk will explore real-world vulnerabilities in GitHub Actions, demonstrating how attackers can exploit insecure workflows. We’ll walk through common security pitfalls such as workflow injections and secrets disclosure. We will then review the mitigation GitHub has to mitigate these risks.

### **[Efficient Vulnerability Management in Hierarchical Supply Chains](markdown/wrSuIFL3j_c_Efficient_Vulnerability_Management_in_Hierarchical_Supply_Chains.md)** - [Watch Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrSuIFL3j_c)
  **Speakers:** Thomas Kittel (Siemens, DE), Tobias Limmer (Siemens, DE)
  **When:** April 9, 2025 09:30-10:00
  **Abstract:**
  > In many organisations, software development spans multiple interdependent projects. Third-party components, such as software libraries, are embedded within internal software components, which are then integrated into larger software products, continuing the chain. When a vulnerability is reported in one of the third-party components, this chain of projects must evaluate the vulnerability, resulting in a final assessment that determines the risk in the deployed environment.
  > 
  > This presentation will provide insights into our experiences with vulnerability management in this component hierarchy. It will highlight the challenges faced and the benefits gained from leveraging synergies in these circumstances.

### **[Where The Wild Things Are: The State Of Open Source Supply Chain Risk Management In Three Stories](markdown/ZsnOt5o_2HM_Where%20The%20Wild%20Things%20Are_%20The%20State%20Of%20Open%20Source%20Supply%20Chain%20Risk%20Management%20In%20Three%20Stories.md)** - [Watch Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsnOt5o_2HM)
  **Speakers:** Munawar Hafiz Munawar Hafiz (OpenRefactory, US)
  **When:** April 9, 2025 10:00-11:00
  **Abstract:**
  > We worked with the communities managing three key open source projects in three different languages: Apache Airflow (Python), Jenkins (Java) and Kubernetes (Go). The goal was to deliver a better signal about supply chain risk by proactively looking for unknown security vulnerabilities in open source dependencies at scale. We analyzed the source code to detect the vulnerabilities, reported the vulnerabilities in a responsible manner to the open source maintainers and worked with them to get the bugs fixed. At the same time, we worked with the three communities to get a better grip on the risk coming from unknown bugs, known bugs and human factors. We describe how we can derive actionable advice to manage supply chain risks better.

### **[Identifying Malicious OSS Across Ecosystems](markdown/qo8zG13I3dQ_Identifying_Malicious_OSS_Across_Ecosystems.md)** - [Watch Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo8zG13I3dQ)
  **Speakers:** Dan Fiedler (Microsoft, US)
  **When:** April 9, 2025 13:30-14:00
  **Abstract:**
  > Malicious packages are frequently uploaded to and distributed by many different open source repositories. Microsoft operates several of these repositories (e.g., NPM, NuGet, and VSCode marketplace) and has also made a commitment to identify and report malicious packages across other OSS ecosystems. In this talk, we’ll share some techniques we’re using to find malicious OSS, discuss types of malicious behavior we've observed, review developing malicious OSS trends.

### **[Securing Citizen Developers: A New Opportunity to Build Safe Applications](markdown/3KVKEYqHUcQ_Securing%20Citizen%20Developers_%20A%20New%20Opportunity%20to%20Build%20Safe%20Applications.md)** - [Watch Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KVKEYqHUcQ)
  **Speakers:** Kayla Underkoffler Kayla Underkoffler (Zenity, US)
  **When:** April 9, 2025 14:00-14:30
  **Abstract:**
  > The rise of citizen development platforms empowers everyone—from power users to business professionals—to build everything from simple automations to AI agents. While this democratization of development unlocks immense potential, it also presents new security challenges. The security community has struggled for years to instill secure practices in traditional development, often leaving critical vulnerabilities unchecked. With citizen development, we have a unique opportunity to learn from these past failures and establish a security-first foundation from the start.
  > 
  > This presentation explores the who, what, and how of citizen development, examining the risks inherent in low-code/no-code platforms and comparing strategies to mitigate them for citizen developers versus traditional coders. Backed by real numbers and success stories, we’ll share actionable insights for fostering a secure set of guardrails among these new builders, unlocking their potential without introducing new vulnerabilities.

### **[Operationalizing SSVC](markdown/OTG7ZzGMFsw_Operationalizing_SSVC.md)** - [Watch Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTG7ZzGMFsw)
  **Speakers:** Lindsey Cerkovnik Lindsey Cerkovnik (CISA, US), Sean Letona (CISA, US)
  **When:** April 9, 2025 14:30-15:00
  **Abstract:**
  > The Stakeholder-Specific Vulnerability Categorization (SSVC), developed in 2019 by Carnegie Mellon University's Software Engineering Institute (SEI) in collaboration with the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), offers an innovative approach to vulnerability response. In a rapidly evolving threat landscape, prioritizing vulnerabilities for CISA is a considerable undertaking. CISA manages an incredible scope covering federal civilian (FCEB) agencies, State, Local, and Trivial Territorial (SLTT) governments, and the Critical Infrastructure (CI) sector. Effectively, vulnerability prioritization is essential for safeguarding critical systems. This talk will explain how CISA was pivotal in sponsoring SSVC's development and became the first organization to implement and operationalize the methodology in 2020. We will explore the core components of SSVC, including its four decision outcomes—Track, Track*, Attend, and Act—and the five key values: exploitation status, technical impact, automation potential, mission prevalence, and public well-being impact. Attendees will
  > gain insight into the customized decision tree model developed by CISA and the lessons learned from implementing this framework at scale. It also covers the implementation of CISA's SSVC within multiple teams, the dynamics of having one branch doing centralized prioritization analysis, and how other teams use SSVC as a foundational tool in vulnerability response and coordination.

### **[Building a PSIRT for a Standards Organization](markdown/HzSkFOKggso_Building_a_PSIRT_for_a_Standards_Organization.md)** - [Watch Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzSkFOKggso)
  **Speakers:** Jim Duncan (Jim Duncan, US)
  **When:** April 10, 2025 16:30-17:00
  **Abstract:**
  > Standards groups should have a policy for handling alleged flaws in their "product" and in upstream code, if any, that they modify and include in their own product. However, few such organizations have a well-defined process and policy. There are many challenges, the least of which is that the participants are competitors (as mentioned previously) and it will be inferred that agreeing to a PSIRT policy and process for a standards group will imply a loss of control
  > over the intellectual property. This presentation will highlight the unexpected challenges of establishing a PSIRT within a standards organization with a goal of helping others to bootstrap and run a vulnerability-handling mission for other standards groups.

### **[State of Attack Surface Elimination in a World Plagued by Vulnerable Software](markdown/yGq2GKx0Ypc_State_of_Attack_Surface_Elimination_in_a_World_Plagued_by_Vulnerable_Software.md)** - [Watch Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGq2GKx0Ypc)
  **Speakers:** Gaurav Gogia (Qualys, IN), Mayuresh Dani (Qualys, US)
  **When:** April 10, 2025 16:00-16:30
  **Abstract:**
  > Vulnerability detection and elimination is a complex task, often completed in separate steps through multiple products. The level of complexity for detections is further increased by the number of ways a software can be installed, while on the other hand patches tend to be slow or come with breaking changes or in the worst case, end up fixing only a small set of the vulnerability that is often bypass by a payload update. One of the ways of getting around it is to apply deep learning for better generalization of vulnerability detection on exe/binary files to avoid the dependency on software versions and feeding all the detections to a mitigation engine that can eliminate the attack surface entirely without the need of a software patch/update.

### **[When it Comes to Managing Risk, Context is King](markdown/Hwyv9WHVyjg_When_it_Comes_to_Managing_Risk,_Context_is_King.md)** - [Watch Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hwyv9WHVyjg)
  **Speakers:** Lucas Tamagna-Darr (Tenable, US)
  **When:** April 10, 2025 11:00-12:00
  **Abstract:**
  > Vulnerability Management teams have long faced a seemingly insurmountable task of addressing a seemingly endless list of CVEs - over 240,000 to date and on track to see over 30,000 published this year. In this talk we’ll look at the limitations of both CVSS and EPSS when it comes to making reliable and defensible risk based prioritization decisions and learn how to better leverage both vulnerability and asset context to make fast decisions and build long term sustainable exposure management strategies.

  **When:** April 10, 2025 14:30-15:30
  **Abstract:**
  > Fixing or otherwise mitigating a vulnerability requires action. By someone. For user- or customer-controlled software, this “someone” is the user or customer who performs actions such as update, upgrade, patch, make a change configuration, rebuild, or fetch new dependencies. For software as a service, this “someone” is the service provider, while the user or customer may not need to take any material action. A browser refresh, session timeout, or a new API call uses the fixed software. What does it mean to assign CVE IDs to no-user-action” vulnerabilities? What are the costs and benefits? Is there danger of decreasing the CVE signal-to-noise ratio? How do changes in the CNA Operational Rules apply? A panel of major cloud service CNAs will discuss these questions and more.
