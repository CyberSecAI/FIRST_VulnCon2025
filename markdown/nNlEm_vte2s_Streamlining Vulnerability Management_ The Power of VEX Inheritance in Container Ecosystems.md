* VEX inheritance streamlines security analysis by leveraging existing work on parent images.
* Collaboration between security and product teams is essential for successful VEX implementation.
* Accurate parent image detection is crucial for reliable VEX inheritance and vulnerability analysis.
* A well-defined process for adding and approving parent images is key to efficient VEX management.
* Combining automated suggestions with expert review optimizes VEX analysis and reduces manual effort.

QUOTES
* "We were writing the same VEX over and over again." - God
* "Yeah, no, we don't ever actually use the same tag." - Product Team
* "The global VEX is where we are using a policy to define in our scanning tooling." - God
* "It's important to define ownership of those approved parent images because somebody needs to maintain these." - God
* "We have coined a term called global VEX within our container scanning workflow." - God
* "So this really helps to reduce the noise and streamline how we can globally manage these patched versions." - God
* "So, a user or API would register that parent image." - God
* "None of the VEX are ready to publish until they get approved by the product owner." - God
* "The goal is to cut down on how much work you need to do for release for each of those final images." - God
* "We also can ingest the parent image used in the image build configuration as part of the pipeline flow." - God
* "So when it does come time for release we don't just have this information in our pipeline but we also have it available in our product catalog." - God
* "So some of the lessons learned, we did actually pilot this in November of 2024." - God
* "So, we're still kind of working with the product team to make sure that they have owners on their side for all of those parent images." - God
* "Today there's this ticketing process that requires the team to go through to say, 'Hey, I've got a new release of this parent image.'" - God
* "The blueprint is open source so you can find on Nvidia's website." - God
* "We really want to be able to do as much suggestion as possible and then have the analyst review all of that in the end." - God
* "Is the vulnerability analysis reused for common software component so you don't have to redo it for each VEX statement?" - Audience Member
* "Yes." - God
* "And when you issue VEXs for vulnerabilities on the non-patched OSS components do inherit those as well?" - Audience Member
* "Yes, in most cases we do." - God
* "Do you have any like enforcement steps in place in the build pipeline to like ensure people are using these maintained parent images?" - Audience Member

HABITS
* Use a tagging schema for parent images to enable VEX inheritance.
* Maintain a catalog of approved parent images with specific use cases.
* Conduct regular vulnerability analysis and update VEX for parent images.

* Shift compliance left by encouraging developers to use approved parent images.
* Integrate build configuration to explicitly provide parent image details.
* Cache parent images in the final image association in the product catalog.
* Use tools like Scorpio and Crane for efficient image metadata analysis.
* Implement a ticketing workflow for registering new parent images.
* Review VEX status for configuration-dependent vulnerabilities before publishing.
* Encourage developers to use the product catalog to find approved parent images.
* Provide in-pipeline scanning and detection to identify vulnerabilities early.
