SUMMARY
Omar Santos from Cisco discusses updates to the Common Security Advisory Framework (CISAF) and Open EOX standards.

IDEAS
* CISAF helps machines exchange vulnerability information quickly and efficiently.
* CISAF supports various security advisory profiles, including VEX and generic ones.
* Provider metadata enables machine-readable discovery of security advisories.
* CISAF 2.1 modernizes the standard with new TLP and publisher object support.
* Product identification in CISAF does not aim to replace SBOMs.
* CISAF supports referencing SBOMs like CycloneDX and SPDX for VEX.
* Enhancements align product identification with other standards like PURL.
* Multiple CWEs can now be associated with a single vulnerability in CISAF.
* Date fields for disclosure and discovery dates have been enhanced.
* CISAF now supports scoring metrics beyond CVSS, including EPSS and SSVC.
* Remediation enhancements improve the handling of remediation information.
* CISAF 2.1 is not yet released but is actively being developed.
* Rollie, an RFC standard, enhances the discoverability of security advisories.
* Open EOX addresses the lack of standardization for end-of-support information.
* Open EOX aims to create a common taxonomy for end-of-life and support.
* Open EOX focuses on automation and machine-readable transparency.
* Open EOX seeks international standardization for end-of-support information.
* Open EOX aims for a lightweight schema and common taxonomy for end-of-life.
* Open EOX integrates with SBOMs and security advisories without reinventing them.
* Collaboration and synchronization are crucial for minimizing costs and complexity.
* Additional statuses for VEX are being evaluated and considered for inclusion.
* Contributions to Open EOX are welcome through openex.org or direct contact.
* Feedback and use cases can be submitted via GitHub or the CISAF mailing list.
* CISAF adoption has increased, but further growth is desired.
* Tools and resources are available to help vendors implement CISAF.

INSIGHTS
* Standardized vulnerability information exchange is crucial for ecosystem security.
* Machine-readable standards enable automated vulnerability management and response.
* Collaboration across standards and organizations is essential for effective security.
* Clear definitions and taxonomy are fundamental for consistent communication.
* End-of-support information is critical for managing risk in software and AI.
* Open standards empower both vendors and consumers in the security landscape.
* CISAF and Open EOX contribute to a more secure and transparent software ecosystem.
* Evolving standards must adapt to emerging technologies like AI.
* Community involvement and feedback are vital for successful standard development.
* Practical tools and resources are key to driving standard adoption.

QUOTES

* "We're still trying to struggle how machines can exchange vulnerability information." - Omar Santos
* "Adoption is not just pointing somebody to read a specification." - Omar Santos
* "Rollie is a more proper standard. It is an RFC." - Omar Santos
* "We can have the perfect standard, but if nobody can find it, it's a moot point." - Omar Santos
* "In the age of AI, we don't even have a single way to say what is end of support." - Omar Santos
* "Even within one company, I need a standardization." - Omar Santos
* "It is so sad that we're giving that JSON file to a human." - Omar Santos
* "We need to divorce from that." - Omar Santos
* "100%, it is imperative." - Omar Santos
