SUMMARY
Tommo and Justin discuss establishing a global community of practice on coordinated vulnerability disclosure (CVD).

IDEAS
* CVD is a global process involving various stakeholders and information flows.
* Coordinators facilitate communication and support the CVD process.
* The global nature of CVD necessitates international cooperation.
* Nuances and unique use cases exist in CVD across regions and cultures.
* The community aims to enhance global information corporation and capacity building.
* Knowledge and experience sharing are crucial for overcoming CVD challenges.
* The community seeks to improve CVD effectiveness through harmonization, not policy.
* Coordinators act as bridge builders and neutral facilitators in CVD cases.
* The community values diverse membership and varying levels of CVD experience.
* Challenges include differing CVD images and levels of understanding among members.
* More vocal and less vocal organizations exist within the community.
* Membership is primarily government-related, needing broader stakeholder balance.
* International cooperation and harmonization are key for effective CVD.
* The community aims to improve vulnerability coordination globally.
* Coordination is essential for achieving CVD's goal of risk reduction.
* The community seeks feedback on gaps and needed improvements in CVD.
* The community uses GitHub for asynchronous communication and collaboration.
* A roadmap or milestones for the community's future work is suggested.
* The community has a voting procedure for new member acceptance.
* The high percentage of CNA participation in the community is noted.
* The community encourages feedback and discussion from the wider CVD community.
* The role of CNAs and roots in the CVD process is highlighted.
* The term "disclosure" may not be ideal due to various pre-coordinator actions.
* Existing resources and prior work inform the community's efforts.
* The community aims to build upon and reference existing CVD resources.
* The community seeks to avoid reinventing the wheel in its work.
* The community values input from producers and CNAs/roots.
* The community emphasizes the importance of coordination in CVD.
* The community encourages contact and discussion throughout the week.

INSIGHTS
* Global collaboration is essential for effective CVD due to interconnected supply chains.
* Coordinators play a crucial role in bridging communication gaps and facilitating CVD.
* Harmonizing CVD practices globally can improve vulnerability management and risk reduction.
* Diverse perspectives and experiences within the community enrich its approach to CVD.
* Addressing varying levels of understanding and engagement is key for community success.
* Balancing government and private sector involvement is crucial for holistic CVD improvement.
* Continuous improvement and adaptation are necessary for effective CVD in a dynamic landscape.
* The community's focus on coordination addresses a critical gap in existing CVD practices.
* Leveraging existing resources and expertise avoids redundancy and maximizes impact.
* Seeking feedback from the wider community ensures relevance and practicality of the work.
* The community's structure promotes inclusivity and collaboration among diverse stakeholders.
* The community's work contributes to a more secure global digital ecosystem.
