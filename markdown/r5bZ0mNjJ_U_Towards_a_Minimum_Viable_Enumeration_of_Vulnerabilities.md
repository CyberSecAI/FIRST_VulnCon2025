SUMMARY
Art and Jay discuss Minimum Viable Vulnerability Enumeration (MVVE) at Volcon, focusing on core elements for vulnerability identification.

IDEAS
* MVVE aims to define the minimum information needed to uniquely identify vulnerabilities.
* The core of MVVE includes a unique identifier and product affected by the vulnerability.
* The discussion explores the phases of vulnerability management and stakeholder roles.
* They emphasize the importance of disambiguating vulnerabilities for effective management.
* The presentation highlights the need for enough information to initiate vulnerability management.
* They discuss the challenges of defining and standardizing vulnerability information.
* The speakers consider the minimum elements needed in a vulnerability database record.
* They explore the concept of primary and secondary vulnerability databases.
* The presentation touches upon the risk management aspect of vulnerability handling.
* They analyze the various information elements commonly found in vulnerability records.
* The speakers discuss the importance of data quality and management in this context.
* They introduce the concept of Adequate Enumeration (AVE) as an extension of MVVE.
* The discussion includes the role of remediation in the vulnerability management process.
* They consider the importance of prioritization in modern vulnerability management.
* The speakers discuss the challenges of naming and identifying vulnerabilities.
* They explore the relationship between vulnerabilities and product versions.
* The presentation touches upon the concept of enriching vulnerability databases.
* The speakers consider the role of different stakeholders in vulnerability disclosure.
* They discuss the various disclosure patterns and their implications.
* The presentation highlights the importance of communication and coordination in remediation.
* They explore the challenges of vulnerability management in large organizations.
* The speakers discuss the idealized versus actual timeline of vulnerability management.
* They consider the role of exposures in addition to vulnerabilities.
* The presentation mentions the development of a paper on this topic.
* They discuss the use of CWE for describing vulnerabilities.
* The speakers emphasize the importance of product identifier specificity.

INSIGHTS
* A unique identifier and affected product are the core elements for identifying a vulnerability.
* Effective vulnerability management requires disambiguation and sufficient information for action.
* Data quality, architecture, and structure are crucial for vulnerability data management.
* Adequate Enumeration builds upon MVVE by adding remediation information.
* Prioritization is essential in modern vulnerability management due to increasing complexity.
* Naming and identifying vulnerabilities are complex tasks with philosophical implications.
* Enriching vulnerability databases with additional information enhances their utility.
* Different stakeholders have varying motivations and goals in vulnerability disclosure.
* Communication and coordination are key for successful remediation, especially in large organizations.
* The idealized vulnerability management timeline often differs from the actual process.

QUOTES
* "What information do we need in a vulnerability record to uniquely identify a vulnerability?" - Art
* "We're not going to have zero vulnerabilities." - Art
* "How do we define those? How do we talk about those?" - Art
* "We really really focused on the absolute absolute minimum." - Art
* "This got into a discussion about vulnerability management." - Art
* "If I remove one of the elements does the thing fall apart?" - Art
* "How many ways should a record represent what's affected or not affected?" - Art
* "We had to sort of talk about everything else around them." - Art
* "Fitting in is actually a pretty key part of our work here." - Jay
* "The focus is the information elements." - Jay
* "The key thing that I think is a pivot point is around four." - Jay
* "Local context is going to provide color." - Jay
* "This is a very very large challenge." - Jay
* "We couldn't avoid some of the framing." - Jay
* "The phases I felt are going to turn out to be kind of more important to our work." - Jay
* "We borrowed our title slightly from this seminal paper from 1999." - Art
* "A lot of stuff in this paper is still valid." - Art
* "The first and very core element of MVVE is that it must contain unique and public identifier." - Jay
* "We spent quite a bit of time talking about terms and definitions." - Jay
* "I need to disambiguate these things, right?" - Jay
* "We all might disagree on what is a vulnerability and what is three vulnerabilities." - Jay
* "This is really what the reality is." - Art
* "There's a lot of motivations and pulling and pushing." - Art
* "If your logo's not in here, I apologize." - Art
* "Clearly there are things missing." - Jay
* "Humans will hate you, but you can have a gooid." - Art
* "A vulnerability affects a product." - Art
* "This is the minimum. This is the core of what you need." - Art
* "Without this, you're not doing anything else in vuln management land." - Jay
* "It's pretty decent. It's going to get better." - Art
* "We'll welcome good comments though. Zero is a number." - Art
