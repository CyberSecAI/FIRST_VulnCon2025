SUMMARY
Patrick Gity, security researcher at Vone, discusses exploited CVEs of 2024, offering lessons for vendors and defenders.

IDEAS
* Exploited vulnerabilities in 2024 offer lessons for vendors and security professionals.
* Transparency is crucial when discussing exploitation and related evidence.
* Free service and API access are available for validating research data.
* Known exploited vulnerabilities encompass those publicly reported as exploited.
* False positives are common in automated feeds about vulnerabilities.
* Disclosing exploitation evidence aids defenders in prioritizing patches.
* Emerging threats require rapid response and capacity planning.
* Categorizing vulnerabilities helps focus efforts on target areas.
* Content Management Systems, especially WordPress plugins, are highly targeted.
* Network edge devices and operating systems need quick patching.
* Open-source software requires attention from application developers.
* Ransomware, though a small portion, is a top concern for organizations.
* Vulnerability scoring systems need improvement for emerging threats.
* CVSSBT doesn't significantly change severity prioritization.
* EPSS scoring improved in V4, but more time is needed for evaluation.
* Defenders should use all available evidence for prioritization.
* Over-reliance on scoring systems without analysis is dangerous.
* Communicate limitations of scoring systems to avoid misinterpretation.
* Act on exploitation evidence, weaponization, and other indicators.
* Consider rapid response, internet-facing devices, and user behavior.
* Address vulnerability debt through root cause analysis and best practices.
* Implement proper mitigating controls and patch management processes.
* Prune and remove end-of-life technologies to reduce risk.
* Coordinate disclosure and work with CNAs for timely CVE assignment.
* Leverage trusted sources and be cautious of automated feeds.
* Focus on initial access and exploitation for quick mitigation.
* Consider compensating controls and keep plugins updated.

INSIGHTS
* Public disclosure of exploitation evidence is crucial for timely patching.
* Emerging threats necessitate proactive capacity planning and rapid response.
* Categorizing vulnerabilities by target area facilitates efficient patching.
* Scoring systems, while useful, require careful interpretation and analysis.
* Vulnerability debt requires a proactive approach to root cause analysis.
* Transparency and collaboration are essential for effective vulnerability management.
* Defenders should prioritize known exploited vulnerabilities with urgency.
* Vendors should disclose exploitation evidence in their advisories.
* Scoring systems should be continually improved and limitations communicated.
* A combination of automated tools and human analysis is crucial.

QUOTES
* "Don't shoot the messenger." - Patrick Gity
* "We really focus on being as transparent as possible when we're talking about exploitation." - Patrick Gity
* "You can go validate our research if you don't believe us." - Patrick Gity
* "We ask that everyone discloses the exploitation publicly for a reason. Like it helps everybody." - Patrick Gity
* "I think of them as emerging threat." - Patrick Gity
* "The evidence is all public records. So you don't have to trust me." - Patrick Gity
* "If you're a CNA or a vendor, when there's evidence of exploitation, it is really helpful for the defenders." - Patrick Gity
* "It's really important, urgent to fix." - Patrick Gity
* "There are vendors disclosing exploitation which is great." - Patrick Gity
* "You make sure you have compensating controls." - Patrick Gity
* "Initial access devices are things you should make sure they're not end of life." - Patrick Gity
* "Ransomware is often a top concern to organizations from a target perspective." - Patrick Gity
* "Users love to click on links." - Patrick Gity
* "This does not help defenders." - Patrick Gity
* "I think there's an opportunity here to change what we've done for the last 25 years." - Patrick Gity
* "Solely relying on that is very dangerous." - Patrick Gity
* "It's very dangerous if we do not communicate properly the limitations of these scoring systems." - Patrick Gity
* "Act on available exploitation evidence with a sense of urgency." - Patrick Gity
* "There are great components of CVSS, EPSS has great signal." - Patrick Gity

HABITS
* Audits vulnerability feeds to identify false positives.
* Encourages public disclosure of exploitation evidence.
* Focuses on emerging threats and known exploits.

* Recommends pruning end-of-life technologies.
* Analyzes exploitation data for trends and patterns.
* Works with CNAs to coordinate vulnerability disclosure.
* Uses multiple sources to collect exploitation evidence.
* Advocates for improved vulnerability scoring systems.
* Emphasizes the importance of mitigating controls.
* Encourages root cause analysis for vulnerability debt.
* Promotes transparency in vulnerability reporting.
* Recommends using frameworks like SSVC for prioritization.
* Urges defenders to act with a sense of urgency.

FACTS
* Over 800 vulnerabilities had exploitation evidence disclosed in 2024.
* Over 2,000 known exploited reference citations exist.
* Over 100 unique sources contribute to exploitation evidence.
* 53 vulnerabilities have known ransomware associations.
* Sysv has a federal scope, not designed for all enterprises.
* Patch Tuesday helps defenders patch broadly.
* WordPress plugins are frequently exploited.
* Metasploit modules indicate likely exploitation.
* CVSSBT has a marginal impact on severity scores.
* EPSS V4 improved scoring for 2024 CVEs.
* Most consumers aren't knowledgeable about scoring system limitations.
* End-of-life technology contributes to vulnerability debt.
