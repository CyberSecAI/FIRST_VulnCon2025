SUMMARY
Probe, Mike Lieberman, and Eddie Knight discuss open-source software security, compliance, and the Cyber Resilience Act (CRA).

IDEAS
* Open-source maintainers are not liable for vulnerabilities if not selling products.
* Manufacturers are responsible for vulnerabilities in their products, including open-source components.
* The CRA requires manufacturers to provide notice of exploited vulnerabilities within 24 hours.
* The CRA requires a security advisory within 72 hours for severe vulnerabilities.
* Manufacturers must report on compliance by December 11, 2026.
* The Open Source Project Security Baseline (OPSP) defines minimum security requirements.
* OPSP helps upstream and downstream users understand project security practices.
* OPSP aligns with various security frameworks, including NIST and the CRA.
* Forking open-source projects is risky and expensive due to rapid release cycles.
* Collaborating with upstream maintainers and stewards is crucial for security.
* The CRA imposes fines of up to 2.5% of global revenue for non-compliance.
* Engaging with open-source stewards amplifies the voice of manufacturers.
* Contributing to open source can be as simple as showing up and asking questions.
* The CRA promotes collaboration between security and compliance efforts.
* Manufacturers should identify their most critical open-source projects.
* The OPSP provides a blueprint for software procurement and ingestion.
* The CRA has four classes of software with varying obligations.
* Critical products require third-party conformance assessments.
* Important products have two subcategories with different assessment levels.
* All other products require self-assessment and adherence to standards.
* The CRA aims to improve software security by incentivizing collaboration.
* The OPSP helps manufacturers comply with CRA requirements.
* The CRA encourages engagement with upstream open-source communities.
* The CRA has been refined to address concerns and clarify requirements.
* The CRA aims to create a more secure software ecosystem.
* The CRA provides legal teeth to enforce security best practices.
* The CRA offers multiple options for compliance, including not selling in Europe.
* The CRA encourages collaboration with upstream maintainers and stewards.
* The CRA aims to improve software security by incentivizing collaboration.
* The CRA provides legal teeth to enforce security best practices.
* The CRA offers multiple options for compliance, including not selling in Europe.

INSIGHTS
* Shared responsibility for open-source security exists between maintainers and manufacturers.
* The CRA shifts the burden of open-source security to commercial entities.
* Collaboration with upstream communities is essential for CRA compliance.
* The OPSP offers a practical framework for achieving open-source security.
* Continuous compliance is becoming increasingly important in software development.
* The CRA aims to improve software security by holding manufacturers accountable.
* Engaging with open-source stewards can amplify the voice of manufacturers.
* The CRA encourages proactive vulnerability management and disclosure.
* The OPSP bridges the gap between security and compliance.
* Contributing to open source can significantly improve software security.
