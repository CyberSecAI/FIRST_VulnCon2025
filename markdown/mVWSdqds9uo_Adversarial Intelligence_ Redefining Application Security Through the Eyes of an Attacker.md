SUMMARY
Roy, from Codm Security, discusses lessons learned from NSO Group's Pegasus spyware, focusing on vulnerability chains and attacker mindset.

IDEAS
* Medium and low vulnerabilities are numerous and often overlooked by security teams.
* Attackers exploit chains of vulnerabilities, not just single critical ones.
* CVSS lacks context and doesn't reflect the true risk to an environment.
* Security tools are noisy, creating large backlogs and fragmented views.
* Attackers exploit organizational workflows, not just applications.
* The MITRE ATT&CK framework provides a common language for understanding attacker goals.
* Vulnerability chains allow for proactive prioritization and remediation.
* Chains enable storytelling, improving communication and collaboration.
* Attackers take what they have and weave their way through systems.
* An holistic approach is crucial for effective security.
* Small vulnerabilities chained together can have a critical impact.
* Chains allow for backup plans, enabling faster exploitation.
* Stories help communicate risk and prioritize fixes.
* Knowing your environment and infrastructure is a key advantage.
* Inventorying assets is crucial but challenging in complex environments.
* Mitigations are powerful and should inform prioritization.
* Thinking in chains is essential for understanding true risk.
* Two chained medium vulnerabilities can be more critical than isolated critical ones.
* Open-source tools like TeamPipe, Sift, and OpenGrip are valuable.
* AI can help classify vulnerabilities and connect them to ATT&CK techniques.
* Fine-tuning AI models on specific vulnerability databases yields better results.
* Attackers exploit SLAs and the time it takes to fix medium/low vulnerabilities.
* Attackers look for adjacent vulnerabilities to expand their reach.
* Prioritize privilege escalation and data exfiltration vulnerabilities.
* Fuzzing and code analysis are key for finding undisclosed vulnerabilities.
* Labeling vulnerabilities with tactics and techniques helps reveal patterns.
* AI can help build compelling stories about potential attack scenarios.
* Knowing yourself and your environment is a powerful advantage over attackers.

INSIGHTS
* Understanding attacker mindset is crucial for effective defense.
* Focusing on vulnerability chains provides a more realistic risk assessment.
* Effective security requires a holistic view of the entire system.
* Proactive vulnerability management involves breaking chains, not just fixing individual issues.
* Clear communication and storytelling are essential for security collaboration.
* Leveraging existing knowledge and infrastructure is a key defensive advantage.
* AI can significantly enhance vulnerability analysis and prioritization.
* Attackers exploit the time and resource constraints of security teams.
* Practical application of the MITRE ATT&CK framework improves security posture.
* Combining automated tools with human expertise maximizes security effectiveness.

QUOTES
* "So two mediums can be critical when chained together." - Roy
* "So the MITRE ATT&CK framework helps us by setting those tactics and techniques." - Roy
* "The chain creates a story." - Roy
* "Know yourself." - Roy
* "As an attacker, you take what you got." - Roy
* "We take a holistic approach as attackers." - Roy
* "Most vulnerabilities need to be chained together in order to be effectively exploited." - Roy
* "It's really powerful to talk about it and to like shed some give some color to everything that we do in communicate." - Roy
* "It's about know your enemy." - Roy
* "It's the essentially the biggest leverage that or um advantage that you have over the attackers that you have first party access to all your infrastructure, code and people." - Roy
* "So it's really important to look at those applications as a complex." - Roy
* "So it allows us to really think um about effectively uh remediating and improving the posture score." - Roy
* "So it's getting better and you can apply those tools like open like any CH GPT uh can help you classify uh vulnerabilities." - Roy
* "So when they will be disclosed I can assume I can prepare like ahead of time because I know those SLA ahead of time." - Roy
* "So eventually you know we want the cheese." - Roy
* "So those SLAs and this distribution make it easier to us to try to exploit mediums." - Roy
* "So the main thing like for the second one it's it's mainly fuzzing and going through code." - Roy
* "Story is something that we are able like most of the hands here was application security guys." - Roy
* "So chaining is obviously it's hard like people work on it full-time." - Roy
* "So yeah, storytelling I think it's great uh to give him the description and everything and it really builds the what the attacker is going to do." - Roy

HABITS
* Analyze vulnerabilities and software for exploitation potential.
* Build chains of vulnerabilities to exploit systems.
* Use storytelling to communicate and teach about exploits.
* Take a holistic approach to security, considering the entire system.
* Focus on privilege escalation and data exfiltration vulnerabilities.
* Use fuzzing and code analysis to find undisclosed vulnerabilities.
* Label vulnerabilities with tactics and techniques to identify patterns.
* Fine-tune AI models on specific vulnerability databases.
* Prepare for future exploits by understanding SLAs and disclosure timelines.
* Continuously learn and adapt to new attack vectors and vulnerabilities.
* Prioritize fixing vulnerabilities based on their role in chains.
* Communicate effectively with other teams in the organization.
* Use open-source tools for vulnerability analysis and management.
* Leverage AI for vulnerability classification and storytelling.
* Understand the attacker's perspective and motivations.

FACTS
* Thousands of new vulnerabilities are discovered every day.
* Medium and low vulnerabilities are often overlooked due to SLAs.
* CVSS scores don't always reflect the true risk to an environment.
* Security tools can generate noisy alerts and create large backlogs.
* Many security tools have a narrow focus and lack full context.
* Attackers often chain multiple vulnerabilities to achieve their goals.
* The MITRE ATT&CK framework provides a common language for security.
* Some vulnerabilities are more crucial for forming chains than others.
* Attackers exploit organizational workflows and processes.
* NSO Group used storytelling to teach about exploits.
* AI can be used to classify vulnerabilities and build attack stories.
* Fuzzing is a technique used to find undisclosed vulnerabilities.
* Open-source tools can be valuable for security analysis.
* Vulnerability databases can be used to build graphs and analyze chains.
* Pegasus spyware targeted both iPhones and Android devices.
