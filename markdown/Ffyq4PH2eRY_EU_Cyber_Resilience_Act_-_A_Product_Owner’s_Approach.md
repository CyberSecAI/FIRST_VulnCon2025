SUMMARY
Langley Rock discusses the EU CRA from a product owner's perspective, focusing on compliance and its impact on software/hardware vendors.

IDEAS
* EU CRA compliance is mandatory for vendors wanting to conduct business within the EU market.
* Non-compliance can result in substantial fines, impacting downstream suppliers significantly.
* Open-source components vulnerabilities are the responsibility of the vendor using them.
* Strict "no known vulnerabilities" enforcement may hinder timely product releases.
* Harmonized standards offer a path to compliance, but are still under development.
* Proactive approach, risk assessment, and stakeholder communication are crucial.
* Categorizing products (default, class 1, class 2, critical) is essential.
* General-purpose computing platforms aren't automatically class one, despite components.
* A three-year product plan should incorporate security requirements proactively.
* Continuous testing, secure updates, and vulnerability response are key themes.
* Vulnerability response requirements begin in September 2026, not December 2027.
* Machine-readable advisories are crucial for vulnerability disclosure.
* Internal security assessments, risk analysis, and documentation are necessary.
* Grouping CRA requirements into themes aids understanding and organization.
* A security charter builds credibility and prepares stakeholders for compliance.
* Risk-based reporting helps prioritize efforts and address potential gaps.
* Socializing CRA requirements top-down and bottom-up ensures organizational alignment.
* The EU CRA will significantly impact end-to-end security product team functions.
* Collaboration through organizations like Safecode and OpenSSF will be essential.
* The next two and a half years will be challenging for industry-wide alignment.
* Known exploitable vulnerabilities require a milestone in the development lifecycle.
* Due diligence and documentation are key for demonstrating compliance efforts.
* Continuous testing and awareness are crucial for detecting and patching vulnerabilities.
* Rapid deployment doesn't preclude checking for and patching existing vulnerabilities.
* "Placed on the market" and "available on the market" have distinct timeframes.
* A recommended risk management framework is already available for guidance.

INSIGHTS
* Proactive planning and risk management are crucial for EU CRA compliance.
* Open-source vulnerability responsibility shifts the burden to incorporating vendors.
* The EU CRA necessitates a shift in product development priorities and timelines.
* Harmonized standards, while not yet finalized, offer a roadmap for compliance.
* Effective communication and collaboration are essential for navigating the EU CRA.
* The "no known vulnerabilities" requirement necessitates a nuanced approach.
* Continuous testing and vulnerability response are integral to long-term compliance.
* The EU CRA presents both challenges and opportunities for industry improvement.
* Understanding product classifications is key to determining compliance requirements.
* A robust security charter strengthens stakeholder engagement and compliance efforts.
