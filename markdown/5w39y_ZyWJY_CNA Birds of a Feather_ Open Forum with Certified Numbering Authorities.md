SUMMARY
David Welch moderates a panel with Jonathan Evans, Lisa Olsson, and Scott Moore discussing the history, structure, and future of the CVE program.

IDEAS
* The CVE program helps identify and catalog cybersecurity vulnerabilities.
* Scott Moore assigned 2.5% of all CVEs, a significant contribution.
* Early CVE validation involved manual testing on hardware, a complex process.
* In 2005, the CVE program began delegating to CNAs, improving scalability.
* The program transitioned from reactive vulnerability discovery to proactive reservation.
* The CVE program has adapted and evolved over 25 years, a testament to its value.
* AI and improved tooling are key areas for future development in the CVE program.
* CNAs outpacing MITER in CVE publishing signifies community growth and engagement.
* Open source projects can request CVEs through GitHub or Red Hat, simplifying the process.
* The CVE program relies on peer pressure and community involvement to maintain quality.
* The CVE board addresses issues with CNAs not adhering to program standards.
* Regular review of naming rules is crucial for CNAs to maintain compliance.
* The CVE program prioritizes some information over none, even if imperfectly formatted.
* Incremental changes to CVE rules are preferred over major overhauls for smoother evolution.
* The CVE program encourages collaboration and knowledge sharing among CNAs.
* New CNAs often find a lack of standardized tools for CVE management.
* Bespoke tools are common due to the specific needs of different CNAs.
* The CVE program provides resources like a REST API and GUI tools for CVE management.
* The Vulnerog tool offers a user-friendly interface for CVE record creation.
* Community involvement and tool development are encouraged within the CVE program.
* Active participation in working groups and Slack channels enhances CNA engagement.
* Surveys provide valuable feedback for improving the CVE program and its resources.
* The CVE program values transparency by publishing board meeting minutes.
* The CVE program emphasizes collaboration and compromise among its members.
* The program prioritizes working with CNAs to improve rather than immediate removal.
* The CVE program encourages open communication and feedback from all stakeholders.
* The CVE program strives to balance standardization with inclusivity for diverse participants.
* The program aims for incremental record format updates every six months for stability.

INSIGHTS
* The CVE program's success stems from its adaptability and community-driven approach.
* Decentralization through CNAs has been essential for scaling the CVE program.
* Proactive vulnerability disclosure is crucial for minimizing cybersecurity risks.
* The CVE program faces challenges in balancing quality control with rapid growth.
* Community engagement and peer pressure are vital for upholding CVE quality.
* Open communication and transparency are key for addressing program challenges.
* Tooling and automation are critical for improving CVE management efficiency.
* The CVE program's longevity highlights its importance in the cybersecurity landscape.
* Balancing standardization with flexibility is crucial for program inclusivity.
* Continuous improvement and adaptation are essential for the CVE program's future.

QUOTES
* "Somehow 30 years later, I've assigned two and a half% of all the CVEs." - Scott Moore
* "MITER was doing probably 90% of the assignments." - Scott Moore
* "MITER would reserve a CV ID for a vulnerability, but then a researcher might publish it and never tell MITER about it." - Scott Moore
* "We have to be able to monitor it so that we know when you've published and when we need to publish." - Scott Moore
* "Up until like 2011, I think, we were using Steve Christie's personal MITER email." - Scott Moore
* "There were more CVs reserved in advanced than assigned after the vulnerability was caught." - David Welch
* "As of this afternoon, 450 CNAs." - Lisa Olsson
* "2024 was the biggest year over 40,000." - David Welch
* "This is so far at least the first time ever where we have CNAs that are actually out publishing MITER for the first time." - David Welch
* "If your project's on GitHub, you can request a CV through GitHub. We'll do everything." - Jonathan Evans
* "Red Hat is the root for all open source that isn't in anybody else's scope." - Jonathan Evans
* "MITER approves the CNA. So if a CNA is not working properly, it should be a concern for MITER." - Madison
* "The CVE program relies on peer pressure to some degree to keep the CVEs at high quality." - Jonathan Evans
* "There have been CNAs that have been removed from the program in the past." - Madison
* "Just email cve at miter.org and it'll get there." - Dave Morse
* "The program always wants to work with you if you want to work with us." - Dave Morse
* "Vulner saved my rear whenever we had a catastrophic lab failure at one point." - David Welch
