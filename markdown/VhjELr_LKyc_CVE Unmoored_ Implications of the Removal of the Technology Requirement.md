SUMMARY
Jonathan Evans, GitHub advisory database curator, discusses the implications of removing the technology requirement from CVE rules.

IDEAS
* CVEs can now be assigned to vulnerabilities in cloud services and AI.
* The new rules emphasize the CNA's judgment on CVE appropriateness.
* A consensus around a vulnerability-like thing should lead to rule additions.
* Buffer overflows in content distribution networks now qualify for CVEs.
* Bypassing deep fake protections in AI services does not warrant a CVE.
* SQL injections in custom student portals now qualify for CVEs.
* Vulnerabilities in websites caused by common plugins are traditional CVEs.
* Physical attacks, like resonance causing device malfunction, are excluded.
* Bypassing a padlock with a weak spring can qualify for a CVE.
* Porting out a victim's phone number might qualify for a CVE.
* Radio jamming to disable a military drone does not qualify for a CVE.
* A pickle scan missing a pip.make object might qualify for a CVE.
* Mistakes in GitHub action scripts leading to secret exposure qualify.
* Viruses for biological-based RNA computers might qualify for CVEs.
* Bypassing a tamper-proof seal on a Bitcoin qualifies for a CVE.
* Internet prompts used in LLM training data do not qualify for CVEs.
* A package with a typo in a dependency name qualifies for a CVE.
* Extracting encryption keys using hardware noises might qualify.
* Quantum computing breaking hash mechanisms qualifies for a CVE.
* A car pedal sticking and causing acceleration does not qualify.
* Elevators sharing a key to bypass floor restrictions do not qualify.
* The potential for a CVE flood due to expanded scope is a concern.
* MITRE might create a policy to scope out specific issues.
* The definition of a physical attack might need re-evaluation.
* Intentional bypassing of physical packaging security is not a vulnerability.
* The expanded scope of CVEs raises concerns about potential misuse.
* The removal of the technology requirement broadens CVE applicability.
* The new rules offer flexibility but require careful judgment from CNAs.

INSIGHTS
* The removal of the technology requirement significantly expands the scope of CVEs.
* CNAs now have greater responsibility in exercising judgment for CVE assignments.
* The new rules acknowledge the evolving nature of vulnerabilities in modern systems.
* The line between physical and software vulnerabilities becomes increasingly blurred.
* The potential flood of CVEs necessitates proactive measures to manage the system.
* The definition of a "physical attack" requires further clarification in the new context.
* The new rules aim to address vulnerabilities in cloud, AI, and other emerging technologies.
* The focus shifts from technology-specific limitations to a more holistic vulnerability assessment.
* The changes reflect the need for adaptability in the face of evolving threat landscapes.
* The emphasis on consensus building ensures community involvement in CVE rule development.

QUOTES
* "The new rules specifically say no technology requirements." - Jonathan Evans
* "The CNA needs to use their own judgment on whether or not a CVE is appropriate." - Jonathan Evans
* "Physical attacks should not get vulnerabilities, unless the product specifically says it protects against that." - Jonathan Evans
* "So technical technological and other changes over time may be considered vulnerabilities." - Jonathan Evans
* "A lot of these rules say 'should' and so there's always that exception of you can, but most of the time you shouldn't." - Jonathan Evans
* "This is one of those social technical technological changes." - Jonathan Evans

HABITS
* Jonathan Evans worked on the CVE team at MITRE for ten years.
* Jonathan Evans currently works as a curator on the GitHub advisory database.
* Jonathan Evans publishes advisories for security issues.
* Jonathan Evans assigns CVEs to vulnerabilities within repositories on GitHub.
* Jonathan Evans suggests MITRE create its own policy to scope out specific issues.
* Jonathan Evans raises awareness about the potential issue of CVE flooding.
* Jonathan Evans recommends using judgment when determining what constitutes a physical attack.
* Jonathan Evans emphasizes the importance of community involvement in CVE rule development.
* Jonathan Evans encourages reporting vulnerabilities directly rather than relying solely on MITRE.
* Jonathan Evans highlights the need for filters to manage the expanded scope of CVEs.

FACTS
* The old CVE rules required vulnerabilities to be non-customer-controlled for assignment.
* Vulnerabilities in services generally didn't require action as the owner fixed them.
* MITRE used to be the only organization assigning CVEs.
* The new rules allow CVEs for vulnerabilities in cloud and AI systems.
* There is an AI working group within the CVE organization.
* Radio jamming is considered a brute force attack and does not get a CVE.
* Insecure default configurations are considered but not required for CVEs.
* Quantum computing can break hash mechanisms and encryption.
* Physical attacks are generally not considered vulnerabilities unless a product claims protection.
* A tag exists for CVE records related to solely hosted services.

RECOMMENDATIONS
* Carefully consider the context and potential impact before assigning a CVE.
* Use judgment when determining if a vulnerability warrants a CVE, especially in gray areas.
* Report vulnerabilities directly to the relevant parties, not just to MITRE.
* Be mindful of the potential for CVE flooding and advocate for proactive management.
* Participate in the CVE community and contribute to the development of clear rules.
* Stay informed about evolving vulnerability trends and adapt your security practices accordingly.
* Consider the broader implications of vulnerabilities beyond traditional software contexts.
* Understand the distinction between security issues and safety issues when assigning CVEs.
* Recognize the evolving nature of physical attacks in the context of modern technology.
* Collaborate with other CNAs and stakeholders to ensure consistent CVE application.
* Advocate for the creation of filters and tags to manage the expanded scope of CVEs.
* Re-evaluate the definition of "physical attack" in light of technological advancements.
* Emphasize the importance of responsible vulnerability disclosure and coordinated efforts.
* Encourage the development of clear guidelines for emerging technologies and vulnerabilities.
* Promote awareness of the expanded CVE scope and its implications for security practices.
