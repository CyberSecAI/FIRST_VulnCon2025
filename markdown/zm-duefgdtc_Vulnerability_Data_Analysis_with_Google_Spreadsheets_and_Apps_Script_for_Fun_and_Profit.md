SUMMARY
Andrew, recently finished at Google, presents an interactive workshop on using ImportJSON with Google Sheets for vulnerability management.

IDEAS
* Visualize vulnerability data using spreadsheets for insightful analysis.
* ImportJSON offers a convenient way to import JSON data into spreadsheets.
* Explore various JSON REST APIs for vulnerability metadata retrieval.
* Create templates to streamline the process and avoid repetitive work.
* Fork the ImportJSON repository to ensure continued access.
* Consider taking over the maintenance of the ImportJSON project.
* Use custom search engines in Chrome for quick access to JSON data.
* Copy and paste values to prevent recalculations and API calls.
* Filter on error values to selectively recalculate specific rows.
* Use named ranges for improved readability and maintainability.
* Transpose arrays to avoid clobbering rows and manage data effectively.
* Index function helps extract specific data from returned arrays.
* Handle missing values gracefully for more robust spreadsheets.
* Leverage AppScript for scheduled refreshes and notifications.
* Explore alternative APIs for different vulnerability data needs.
* Build custom solutions within spreadsheets using AppScript.
* Share tips and tricks within a community of spreadsheet engineers.
* Consider expanding ImportJSON for vulnerability-specific data handling.
* Explore Office 365 compatibility for broader application.
* Use hyperlinks in spreadsheets for direct access to external resources.
* Format dates using custom AppScript functions for better analysis.
* Choose APIs based on specific data requirements and rate limits.
* Schedule refreshes and set up triggers for automated alerts.
* Explore OSV or GitHub's query API for package vulnerability analysis.
* Build spreadsheet-based vulnerability scanners using AppScript.

INSIGHTS
* Spreadsheets can be powerful tools for vulnerability data analysis and visualization.
* ImportJSON simplifies the integration of vulnerability data into spreadsheets.
* Understanding API rate limits and error handling is crucial for efficient data retrieval.
* Custom scripting with AppScript enhances spreadsheet functionality for vulnerability management.
* Collaboration and knowledge sharing within a community can improve spreadsheet-based solutions.
* Choosing the right API and data sources is essential for effective vulnerability analysis.
* Automating data refreshes and notifications streamlines vulnerability monitoring workflows.
* Spreadsheets can be used to build custom vulnerability scanning and analysis tools.

QUOTES
* "AppScript and JavaScript in general, you know, AppScript is just JavaScript that works with Google Sheets." - Andrew
* "Or as we would say at Google, we reinvented the wheel and we vulcanized our own rubber." - Andrew
* "Free is good. We all like free, right?" - Andrew
* "Bailing wire and duct tape vulnerability management solutions." - Andrew
* "So, you can kind of do that as it's a bit clunky." - Andrew
* "All your Chrome browsers belong to me." - Andrew
