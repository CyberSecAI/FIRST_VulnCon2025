**SUMMARY**
Dario Sicaron, from Cisco, discusses Cisco's Vulnerability Repository (CVR) and its usage patterns.

**IDEAS**
* Cisco's CVR provides vulnerability information for third-party software affecting Cisco products.
* CVR offers traditional advisories in HTML and machine-readable CSAF formats.
* Open Vulnerability API allows querying by CVE ID, advisory ID, and product identifier.
* Software Checker helps determine if specific product versions are affected by vulnerabilities.
* Bug Search Toolkit provides information on any defect affecting any Cisco product.
* CVR was launched in May 2022 to centralize third-party vulnerability data.
* Users can request assessments for vulnerabilities with unknown product impact.
* VEX document download capability was added to CVR in June 2023.
* Customers primarily query for vulnerabilities in a small subset of Cisco products.
* A small percentage of CVEs account for a majority of queries.
* Many queries focus on vulnerabilities with medium or low CVSS scores.
* Few queried CVEs are present in the Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) catalog.
* Most queried CVEs relate to OpenSSH, OpenSSL, Apache Tomcat, and curl/libcurl.
* VEX downloads mirror query trends, with similar product and CVE focus.
* Multi-CVE VEX downloads allow comprehensive vulnerability data for specific products.
* Traditional advisories will migrate to CVR within the next six months.
* An API for automated querying and VEX retrieval is under development.
* Cisco seeks feedback from customers and partners on CVR usage.
* Cisco encourages vulnerability scanner vendors to utilize CVR and VEX data.
* CVR improves communication between Cisco and its product development teams.
* Customers exhibit low risk tolerance for vulnerabilities in OpenSSH and OpenSSL.
* Cisco allows development teams to adjust CVSS scores based on product impact.
* CVR data reveals customer priorities and concerns regarding vulnerabilities.
* Cisco aims to provide more accurate vulnerability information through VEX and CVR.
* CVR data can enhance vulnerability scanning accuracy and customer experience.
* Cisco plans to bundle CVR information for offline download for air-gapped systems.
* Cisco's vulnerability policy dictates when full-blown advisories are issued.
* CVR will eventually include Cisco's own CVEs in addition to third-party ones.

**INSIGHTS**
* Centralized vulnerability information platforms enhance transparency and accessibility.
* User behavior data reveals valuable insights into security priorities and concerns.
* Automation and machine-readable formats are crucial for efficient vulnerability management.
* Collaboration between vendors and security tool developers improves ecosystem security.
* Proactive vulnerability assessments and disclosure benefit both vendors and customers.
* Focusing on exploitable vulnerabilities improves resource allocation and risk mitigation.
* Customer risk perception may not always align with CVSS scores.
* Network-based protocols are a key concern for customers of networking devices.
* Continuous improvement and feedback loops are essential for platform development.
* Air-gapped systems require specialized solutions for vulnerability management.

**QUOTES**
* "This is the one ring to rule them all: CVR, the Cisco Vulnerability Repository." - Dario Sicaron
* "This is us, Cisco, telling you about a vulnerability." - Dario Sicaron
* "Rarely about third-party software, and we are telling you about this vulnerability." - Dario Sicaron
* "The API is free. Okay, the advisories are also free in case somebody was wondering." - Dario Sicaron
* "We put it in red in case that, you know, we really needed to make it obvious." - Dario Sicaron
* "Not every CVE is super popular. Okay. It's like there is some people out there that is very, very sad and very, very lonely." - Dario Sicaron
* "This is data from our systems, from our customers, about our products." - Dario Sicaron
* "We move faster than our customer base." - Dario Sicaron
* "People come in asking, 'Does this vulnerability affect my product? Yes or no?' All the time." - Dario Sicaron
* "We don't speak Excel here." - Dario Sicaron
* "The need is there. They are not getting VEX because either they can't or their tools cannot process." - Dario Sicaron
* "Nobody comes complaining about not being able to parse the documents. So either they are perfect or nobody's actually reading them." - Dario Sicaron
* "We are investing in a future that is going to be bright. We hope." - Dario Sicaron
* "Make my life easy. Security scanner vendor." - Dario Sicaron
* "It has made Swaty cry more than once." - Dario Sicaron
* "Instead of chasing ghosts." - Dario Sicaron
* "I love puppies and rainbows and developers, especially." - Dario Sicaron

**HABITS**
* Analyzes data to identify usage patterns and trends in vulnerability queries.
* Uses humor and jokes to engage the audience and make technical topics relatable.
* Emphasizes the importance of clear communication and documentation.
* Encourages collaboration and feedback from customers and partners.
* Prioritizes customer needs and focuses on improving customer experience.
* Continuously seeks ways to improve and enhance existing tools and processes.
* Shares data and insights to benefit the wider security community.
* Advocates for the adoption of standardized vulnerability information formats.
* Values transparency and open communication with development teams.
* Remains adaptable and open to new ideas and approaches.

**FACTS**
* Cisco's CVR was launched in May 2022.
* VEX support was added to CVR in June 2023.
* CVR contains data for over 7,700 unique CVEs.
* Over 13,000 unique users have queried CVR.
* 45% of queried CVEs were queried only once.
* 98% of queried CVEs had less than 100 queries.
* 17 CVEs accounted for over 50% of total queries.
* 55% of queried CVEs have a CVSS score of medium or low.
* Less than 6% of queried CVEs are in the KEV catalog.
* Cisco offers VEX documents for 89 of its 252 products.
* 10 products account for 70% of CVR queries and VEX downloads.
* Traditional Cisco advisories will migrate to CVR in the next six months.
