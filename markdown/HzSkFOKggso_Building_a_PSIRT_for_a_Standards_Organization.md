SUMMARY
Jim discusses his experience developing a vulnerability response capability for standards organizations, specifically the Trusted Computing Group (TCG).

IDEAS
* Standards groups must have a vulnerability response process.
* Resolving a report is different from resolving a vulnerability.
* Engage with subject matter experts carefully.
* Multi-party coordination is crucial internally.
* Intellectual property is essential for standards groups.
* Negotiate clear processes for publishing and decisions.
* Review membership requirements for potential problems.
* Separate oversight from operations, protect the response team.
* The ideal VRT size is four to six people.
* VRT members should be incident response experts.
* VRT members are nominated and approved.
* Incident allocation uses a round-robin scheme.
* Vendor product flaws are the most common issue.
* Specification flaws require TCG intervention.
* Reference code flaws are rare but possible.
* Non-TCG issues are handed off if possible.
* Multi-party coordination is important externally.
* Misaligned communication in large incidents is a nightmare.
* VRT operates like a work group with constraints.
* TCG admin provides support, manages tools.
* No need for TCG to become a CNA.
* Two officers can approve urgent publications.
* Pre-allocate legal counsel consultation time.
* Review crisis management plan for alignment.
* Research the organization's history for past flaws.
* The VRT was stood up in late summer 2019.
* The VRT has been successful and well-received.

INSIGHTS
* Effective vulnerability response balances speed and control.
* Standards groups face unique challenges with IP concerns.
* Clear communication and roles are crucial in incident response.
* Proactive planning and preparation are essential.
* Collaboration and coordination are key to success.
* Incident response requires expertise and flexibility.
* Vulnerability disclosure must be handled carefully.
* Standards development and security are intertwined.
* Building trust and consensus is paramount.
* Continuous improvement is vital for any process.

QUOTES
* "Lecturing has been obsolete since the invention of movable type." - Jim
* "These are competitors working together on a common goal." - Jim
* "Resolving a report versus resolving a vulnerability. That's a very important distinction." - Jim
* "Intellectual property is existential for a standards group." - Jim
* "If you don't take away anything else and you're new to product security incident response, take that away." - Jim
* "The members of the VRT are PERT people from their own employer." - Jim
* "Interactions with SMEs begin with a careful dance." - Jim
* "The VRT itself operates like any other work group." - Jim
* "Nobody is supposed to run reference code, but you know, stuff happens." - Jim
* "Multi-party coordination becomes important." - Jim
* "That is going to be a potential nightmare and calls for a lot of flexibility, grace, and common sense." - Jim
