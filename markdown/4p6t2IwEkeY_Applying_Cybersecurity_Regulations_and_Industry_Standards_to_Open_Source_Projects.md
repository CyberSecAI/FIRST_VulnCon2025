SUMMARY
Luchi Stanesco, security engineering manager at Canonical, discusses applying cybersecurity regulations and industry standards to open source projects.

IDEAS
* Regulations shouldn't be treated as mere tick-box exercises, but considered in spirit.
* Open source is ubiquitous, used even in regulated environments with varying standards.
* Regulatory tools, like questionnaires, can evaluate supply chain security.
* OpenSSF provides best practices and automated tests tailored for open source.
* Mapping regulatory tools to open source tools aids compliance and consistency.
* A stamp of approval from regulatory agencies validates these mappings.
* Continuous tracking and publishing of best practices ensures transparency.
* Open source projects can learn from regulations and improve their practices.
* Communicating a project's life cycle manages user expectations for updates.
* Security declarations benefit open source by setting clear expectations.
* Explicitly defining unsafe functions improves code security and understanding.
* Code quality encourages contributions and simplifies maintenance.
* List privilege minimizes risk in development and supply chain attacks.
* Secure by default configurations enhance usability and harmonize deployments.
* Testing security functionality, including negative testing, is crucial.
* Root cause analysis prevents recurring vulnerabilities in open source.
* Transparency in security handling empowers users and aligns with open source.
* Open source projects should treat vulnerability handling as business as usual.
* Dependency management requires evaluating the maintenance of dependencies.
* Security documentation helps users understand and harden product usage.
* Regulations, based on common best practices, offer valuable insights.
* Open source projects can learn from regulations and improve their security.
* Mapping existing standards is more efficient than creating new ones.
* Communicating expectations and using the same language aids assessment.
* Highly regulated environments also use open source, encouraging its adoption.
* Open source projects care deeply about security and want to fix issues.

INSIGHTS
* Aligning open source practices with regulations benefits both domains.
* Focusing on the spirit of regulations fosters meaningful security improvements.
* Transparency and communication are key for secure open source development.
* Proactive security measures, like list privilege, mitigate supply chain risks.
* Treating vulnerabilities as routine fosters a more resilient ecosystem.
* Code quality and clear documentation enhance collaboration and user trust.
* Mapping existing standards streamlines compliance and promotes consistency.
* Security declarations clarify expectations for contributors and users.
* Secure by default configurations improve usability and reduce complexity.
* Dependency management requires careful evaluation and risk assessment.

QUOTES
* "I'm not a big fan of regulations being treated as tick-box exercises." - Luchi Stanesco
* "It's really important to consider the spirit of any regulation as well, not just the letter." - Luchi Stanesco
* "Regulated environments use it [open source] as well." - Luchi Stanesco
* "Can we fit these together?" - Luchi Stanesco
* "This is basically me trying to demonstrate that this is actually possible." - Luchi Stanesco
* "Good luck stopping open source projects from forking." - Luchi Stanesco
* "Communicating what you're doing, what users' expectations are supposed to be, that is the important thing." - Luchi Stanesco
* "By simply stating that, you are automatically educating people that you need to update." - Luchi Stanesco
* "Open source projects get contributions, right, by definition." - Luchi Stanesco
* "Good luck hiding these [passwords] in open source projects." - Luchi Stanesco
* "People want things to work." - Luchi Stanesco
* "Secure by default is best for the end user." - Luchi Stanesco
* "It's the attackers that actually use the error paths." - Luchi Stanesco
* "Open source projects care deeply about security." - Luchi Stanesco
* "We need to shift the way vulnerabilities are handled from being an exceptional thingâ€¦ to being business as usual." - Luchi Stanesco
* "Open source really goes hand in hand with transparency." - Luchi Stanesco
* "Regulations, they are not imposed on open source projects." - Luchi Stanesco

HABITS
* Communicate life cycle and security updates to manage user expectations.
* Document security best practices and processes for contributors.
* Define and avoid unsafe functions to improve code security.
* Maintain high code quality to encourage contributions.
* Follow least privilege principles to minimize security risks.
* Implement secure by default configurations for better usability.
* Conduct thorough testing, including negative testing, for security.
* Perform root cause analysis for vulnerabilities to prevent recurrence.
* Be transparent about security practices and vulnerability handling.
* Evaluate the security and maintenance of dependencies.
* Document security controls and requirements for users.
* Continuously track and adapt to evolving best practices.
* Prioritize clear communication and education for users.
* Treat vulnerability handling as a routine process.

FACTS
* Open source software is used in highly regulated environments.
* Regulations are based on generic security best practices.
* OpenSSF promotes security best practices in open source.
* OpenSSF Scorecard provides automated security tests.
* NCSC VSA supports the Telecom Security Act.
* CISA provides a supply chain risk management template.
* Supply chain attacks on open source projects are increasing.
* GitHub Actions can be abused for supply chain attacks.
* Code complexity can correlate with vulnerabilities.
* Secure by default configurations improve deployment harmony.
* Attackers exploit unusual code paths, not happy paths.
* Open source projects value transparency in their activities.
