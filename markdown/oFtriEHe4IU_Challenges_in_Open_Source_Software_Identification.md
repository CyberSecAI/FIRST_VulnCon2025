SUMMARY
Martin, from Red Hat's product security team, discusses open-source software identification, focusing on PURL and CPE.

IDEAS
* Software identity aims to assign attributes for identification within an ecosystem.
* Serial numbers require central databases and extensive upkeep, making them impractical.
* Hashes require reproducible artifacts and are difficult to compare, limiting their use.
* URLs can change and lack a standardized format for identity attributes.
* PURL is a standardized approach for identifying and locating software artifacts.
* PURL uses a URL syntax with seven attributes for identification and location.
* PURL is widely adopted in open-source tools like SIFT and Guac.
* PURL downsides include ecosystem-specific packages and URL encoding issues.
* CPE, developed by NIST, is another standard for identifying IT systems and software.
* CPE is a widely open schema, allowing for flexible identification of various things.
* CPE downsides include inconsistent usage and limited tool adoption.
* PURL and CPE are not directly transferable, but conversion efforts exist.
* CVE records use affected objects and CPE applicability statements for identification.
* PURL support in CVE records is not well-defined, limiting its effectiveness.
* OSV, a vulnerability database, supports PURL for component identification.
* Red Hat uses CPE for products and PURL for components with specific guidelines.
* Relating different components, like source code and packages, is a challenge.
* Identifying loose components, like C/C++ libraries, requires industry agreement.
* Accurate software identity is crucial for effective vulnerability management.
* Enforcing standards and enabling contributions can improve data quality.
* Interoperability between formats simplifies data conversion and analysis.
* Contributing to PURL specification and CVE schema improvements is encouraged.
* Accurate data and contributions enable a comprehensive vulnerability data set.
* Different software distributions of the same source code are distinct entities.
* The relationship between different distributions needs to be clearly defined.
* SBOMs are a good mechanism for delivering relationship context between components.
* OSV added an upstream field to its schema to track relationships between vulnerabilities.
* CV Lint tool helps enforce standards and improve CVE data quality.
* Enforcing standards reduces false positives and negatives in vulnerability analysis.

INSIGHTS
* Standardized software identification is crucial for effective vulnerability management.
* PURL and CPE are key standards, but each has limitations and requires further development.
* Accurate and consistent data is essential for interoperability and downstream use cases.
* Community involvement and industry collaboration are key for improving data quality.
* SBOMs play a vital role in defining relationships between different software components.
* The relationship between different software distributions needs to be clearly defined.
* Enforcing standards and enabling contributions can improve data quality.
* Accurate software identification reduces false positives and negatives in vulnerability analysis.
* Tools like CV Lint can help enforce standards and improve CVE data quality.
* Centralized databases can help, but also have their own set of downsides.

QUOTES
* "So when we talk about software identity, what does that actually mean?" - Martin
* "Essentially we're trying to identify a set of attributes that we can assign to something to be able to identify it within its broader ecosystem." - Martin
* "So you must be able to easily retrieve it, right?" - Martin
* "So if you're observing a thing, you should be really quickly be able to tell what it is and determine its identity." - Martin
* "The first thing that comes to mind is model and serial numbers, right?" - Martin
* "Alternatively, we could do hashes, right?" - Martin
* "We could also consider URLs, right?" - Martin
* "So, because we need something, there's standardized things that have been created by the industry that solve this issue." - Martin
* "The first one, probably the oldest one is called CPE." - Martin
* "The newer contender here is PURL, which is a community-led standard." - Martin
* "PURL stands for package URL and it's a standardized approach to identifying and locating software artifacts." - Martin
* "But URLs domains change." - Martin
* "CPEs are technically supposed to be used as part of this central data set that is maintained as the CPE dictionary by NIST." - Martin
* "CPEs are not as widely adopted in the tools that exist in the open-source ecosystem." - Martin
* "So technically we have the information in here that 5.1.4 is the last version that is fixed, but nowhere is it explicitly stated." - Martin
* "I think we need better support for PURL within the CVE record." - Martin
* "The accuracy of this data matters because it essentially ties the one thing that the CVE is related to." - Martin
* "So how can we motivate the CNAs to do this?" - Martin
* "The specification needs a lot of love." - Martin
* "There's a lot of issues and open PRs on GitHub." - Martin

HABITS
* Martin thoroughly researches and analyzes software identification standards.
* Martin actively participates in and contributes to open-source projects.
* Martin presents complex technical information in a clear and accessible way.

FACTS

* PURL's first specification was published in 2017.
* CVE records recently added CPE applicability statements for software identification.
* Red Hat has over 200 products from various language ecosystems.
* OSV aggregates vulnerabilities from different sources into a cohesive data set.
* Qualcomm is a heavy user of consistent CPEs.

* CPE dictionary is maintained by NIST.
* CVE schema has an outstanding issue for PURL support.
* OSV schema recently added upstream as a field.
* CV Lint tool provides data-driven insights for improving CVE standards.
