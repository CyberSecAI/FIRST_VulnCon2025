SUMMARY
Benjamin Edwards and Sandra Vinberg discuss vulnerability risk, expanding its definition and exploring measurement methods.

IDEAS
* Vulnerability risk is more than just loss times probability; context matters significantly.
* Preconditions for vulnerability exploitation include attacker motivation, asset discovery, and exploit availability.
* Losses from vulnerability exploitation extend beyond immediate financial impact to include service disruption and reputational damage.
* Frameworks like FAIR, OCTAVE, NIST CSF, and MITER provide structure but require specific measurements.
* CVSS, while criticized, offers a useful measure of technical severity and predicts exploit code availability.
* Vulnerability footprint measurement is complex, with new detections per month being a reliable metric.
* Remediation time is a risk signal, with faster fixes leading to lower risk, but some vulnerabilities inherently take longer.
* Attacker sophistication varies, with some advanced persistent threats (APTs) using low-probability vulnerabilities.
* Known exploited vulnerability (KEV) lists offer partial views of exploitation activity, but historical data doesn't always predict future trends.
* Software criticality is important, with security software itself being a frequent target of exploits.
* Vulnerability prevalence within an organization is a key risk factor, influenced by footprint size and remediation speed.
* Systemic risk arises from factors outside an organization's control, such as vulnerability distribution across software.
* The Gini coefficient measures vulnerability inequality across organizations, with high concentration indicating faster fixes but greater individual risk.
* Supply chain risk is significant, with some major providers taking a long time to remediate vulnerabilities.
* Measurement zealously should be avoided, as no single metric captures the full picture of vulnerability risk.
* Context is crucial for effective risk management, requiring consideration of asset value, exploitability, attacker sophistication, and remediation speed.
* Sharing data and avoiding fixation on single measurements are key for improving vulnerability risk management.
* Non-CVE vulnerabilities may pose lower risk, as truly dangerous ones likely receive CVE IDs eventually.
* The CVE system, despite its limitations, is essential for discussing, measuring, and analyzing vulnerabilities.
* Visibility and detection are crucial for security research, enabling accurate identification and assessment of vulnerabilities.

INSIGHTS
* Contextual factors, such as attacker sophistication and asset value, are crucial for assessing vulnerability risk.
* Remediation time is a key indicator of risk, with faster fixes mitigating potential exploitation.
* Systemic factors, like vulnerability distribution and supply chain dependencies, influence organizational risk.
* The Gini coefficient provides insights into vulnerability concentration and its impact on remediation speed and individual risk.
* Measurement diversity is essential, as no single metric fully captures the complexity of vulnerability risk.
* Data sharing and collaboration are crucial for improving visibility and understanding of the vulnerability landscape.
* The CVE system, despite its flaws, plays a vital role in enabling communication and analysis of vulnerabilities.
* Focusing solely on exploitation probability overlooks other crucial aspects of vulnerability risk.
* Considering the broader context, including attacker behavior and organizational factors, is essential for effective risk management.
* Combining various measurements and frameworks provides a more comprehensive understanding of vulnerability risk.

QUOTES
* "The only thing that we have to risk is our preconceived notions." - Benjamin Edwards
* "Vulnerability risk is the probability of a loss due to the presence of a vulnerability on an asset that someone cares about." - Benjamin Edwards
* "CVSS is good actually." - Benjamin Edwards
* "Vulnerabilities are only meaningful in context and low, medium, high, who cares?" - Sandra Vinberg's Mentor
* "If Bitsite can see your assets and can fingerprint a CVE on that asset, so can an attacker." - Sandra Vinberg
* "If you don't have a vulnerability, its risk to you is very low." - Sandra Vinberg
* "The faster you fix something, the lower your risk." - Sandra Vinberg
* "Historical exploitation activity does not necessarily predict future exploitation activity." - Sandra Vinberg
* "MITER attack is extraordinarily interesting...but I would argue in its current state right now not really a robust measure of vulnerability risk." - Sandra Vinberg
* "Do not become fixated on any one measurement." - Sandra Vinberg
* "If it doesn't have a CVE, it is not as risky as if it does." - Benjamin Edwards
* "CVE is a mess and it's also a mess that we desperately need." - Benjamin Edwards

HABITS
* Use memes to communicate complex ideas and make them more accessible.
* Build models and use data visualization to analyze vulnerability data.
* Continuously learn and refine understanding of the vulnerability landscape.
* Prioritize vulnerabilities based on context-specific factors, not just CVSS scores.
* Share data and collaborate with others to improve risk management.
* Avoid measurement zealously and consider multiple metrics.
* Focus on remediation time and prioritize faster fixes.
* Consider attacker sophistication and potential consequences when assessing risk.
* Analyze systemic factors like vulnerability distribution and supply chain dependencies.
* Use frameworks like FAIR and OCTAVE to structure risk assessments.

FACTS
* CVSSv3 has approximately 6,000 vectors but only 100 scores.
* Two-thirds of vulnerabilities have high confidentiality, integrity, and availability impact.
* A quarter of vulnerabilities are network accessible with low complexity and no user interaction required.
* The mode of EPSS scores is around 0.5%.
* The median remediation time for vulnerabilities is about a month to a month and a half.
* Some vulnerabilities have been observed for up to nine years.
* The most frequently observed CVE is a cross-site scripting vulnerability in jQuery 3.0 from 2015.
* Groma scans over 40 million organizations, 2.7 billion hostnames, and the entire IPv4 space.
* Most organizations have between 50 and 500 employees and 1 to 1,000 new vulnerability detections per month.
* Remediation time is not correlated with EPSS scores.
* A small subset of vulnerabilities is used by APTs.
* Attackers from different regions focus on different types of vulnerabilities.
* The Gini coefficient can be used to measure vulnerability inequality across organizations.
* Some suppliers serving over 10% of the global economy take more than 200 days to fix vulnerabilities.
