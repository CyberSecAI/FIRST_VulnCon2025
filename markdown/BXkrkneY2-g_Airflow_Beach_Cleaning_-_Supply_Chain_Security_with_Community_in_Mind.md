SUMMARY
Michael Winsor and Yaric discuss Alpha Omega's approach to open-source security, focusing on direct engagement with maintainers.

IDEAS
* Open-source security requires direct engagement, not just funding.
* Focusing on critical dependencies is more effective than broad sweeps.
* Treat all dependencies as your own code; it's your responsibility.
* Building relationships with maintainers is crucial for security.
* Automating vulnerability discovery is helpful, but insufficient.
* Human connection is key to effective security improvements.
* Open-source projects often lack resources for security.
* Companies benefit from investing in open-source security.
* Collaboration between maintainers and users improves security.
* Prioritize dependencies close to revenue for better ROI.
* Cross-organizational problems are human first, technical second.
* The transitive dependency problem is exponentially larger.
* All dependencies have access to your build environment.
* Sandboxing is not a reliable security solution.
* Vendor relationship management is crucial for open source.
* Engage with upstream suppliers to manage risk.
* Consider forking, fixing, or abandoning problematic dependencies.
* Small amounts of money can significantly impact security.
* Measuring security ROI is complex and challenging.
* Reproducible builds are a pillar of supply chain security.
* Temurin is a model for secure open-source practices.
* OpenJDK builds from free sources are discouraged.
* CRA (Corporate Responsibility Act) impacts maintainer decisions.
* Automation and AI can improve security assessment.
* Incremental, regular security processes are essential.
* Share methodologies and findings to improve industry security.
* Consider contributing to broader efforts like PSF standards.
* Focus on the social and economic aspects of open source.

INSIGHTS
* Direct engagement with maintainers is essential for open-source security.
* Prioritizing dependencies with clear ROI maximizes impact.
* Treating dependencies as your code fosters responsibility.
* Human connection is crucial for addressing security issues.
* The transitive dependency problem poses significant risks.
* All dependencies have potential access to sensitive environments.
* Effective vendor relationship management is crucial for open source.
* Collaboration and information sharing improve industry security.
* Small investments can yield substantial security improvements.
* Reproducible builds and robust practices enhance security.

QUOTES
* "Your software is that shiny sports car on top, and that's how much we're treating the stuff underneath it." - Michael Winsor
* "It's your code. It's not someone else's code. It's not someone else's problem. It's your problem." - Michael Winsor
* "Open source people love to complain about how corporations bleed them dry." - Michael Winsor
* "We are only as secure as our dependencies." - Yaric
* "The human component in security bug reporting is important." - Yaric
* "We want to make sure not that numbers are right, but the people we talk to understand." - Yaric
* "If you're using some external software, there's no difference. It's your code. It's your problem." - Michael Winsor
* "You have exactly three choices: fix, fork, or forget." - Michael Winsor
* "There are no small dependencies. Every dependency has total access." - Michael Winsor
* "This is fundamentally a human problem." - Michael Winsor
* "All cross-organizational problems are human first and technical second." - Michael Winsor
* "Use this under pain of security death." - Michael Winsor
* "Temurin is a pillar of supply chain security." - Michael Winsor
* "We actually learn from them more often than not." - Michael Winsor
* "A lot of our work is sort of anecdotal to be honest." - Michael Winsor
* "Measuring security ROI is very tricky." - Michael Winsor
* "The more you put in, the less obvious the need is for it." - Michael Winsor
