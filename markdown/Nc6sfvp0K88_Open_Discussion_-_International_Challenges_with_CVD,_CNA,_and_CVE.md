**SUMMARY**
Reena Rikipi and Tommoito discuss coordinated vulnerability disclosure (CVD) challenges, CNA recruitment, and bug bounty programs.

**IDEAS**
* CVD processes vary across members, hindering effective communication and information sharing.
* Bug bounty programs can be costly and ineffective without proper internal testing.
* Thought diversity in pentesting is crucial for uncovering vulnerabilities missed by internal teams.
* International partners often experience delays and favoritism in vulnerability data sharing.
* A central platform alone cannot solve the problem of convening all stakeholders.
* Machine readability of advisories is key to eliminating the need for pre-disclosure.
* Coordinated disclosure should adhere to a need-to-know principle, not automatic inclusion.
* Coordinators play a vital role in guiding inexperienced researchers and companies.
* The CVE program serves as a coordinator and mentor, fostering organizational maturity.
* Building relationships and informal conversations are crucial for securing systems.
* Trust in automated systems is essential for scaling vulnerability information exchange.
* It's crucial to consider the potential impact of vulnerabilities on other vendors.
* Focusing on risk assessment, not just checklists, is key to effective vulnerability management.
* Quality CNA recruitment and training are essential for improving CVD processes.
* Open communication and collaboration are vital for addressing vulnerability challenges.
* Bug bounty programs are becoming the expected norm, especially for students.
* There's a need for more education on responsible disclosure beyond bug bounties.
* The software community is more open to vulnerability reports, but legal threats persist.
* Publishing advisories should prioritize reducing the overall impact of vulnerabilities.
* The focus should be on fixing the risk of appropriate items, not just patching everything.
* Organizations should own their vulnerability problems and not wait for others to solve them.
* Effective communication is crucial to ensure timely patching of vulnerabilities.
* Building trust and changing behaviors are more important than just increasing CNA numbers.
* Positive communication can help stakeholders understand the value of vulnerability disclosure.
* Mentorship and collaboration between experienced and newer professionals are essential.
* A good certification for CVD professionals would be beneficial for the field.

**INSIGHTS**
* Harmonizing CVD processes is crucial for effective vulnerability management.

* Global collaboration and information sharing are key to addressing vulnerabilities effectively.
* Coordinators and mentors play a vital role in developing CVD expertise.
* Machine-readable data and automated systems are essential for scaling CVD efforts.
* Focusing on risk and impact, not just checklists, improves vulnerability remediation.
* Building trust and fostering open communication are crucial for successful CVD.
* The evolving landscape of CVD requires continuous improvement and adaptation.

**QUOTES**
* "So, you know, no free bugs." - George
* "2025. Are bug bounties assumed?" - Dave
* "Why aren't you taking it to the community to address?" - Pete
* "It's proactive security and depth." - George
* "So really we need to come back to CBD as a need-to-know principle." - Thomas
* "I think machine readability is key if you want to get rid of the pre-disclosure." - Thomas
* "They're called a customer. If the customers don't work, they complain." - Pete
* "The more complaints, the more I was doing my job." - Pete
* "We're not going to impress him with 10,000 CNAs." - Pete
* "The customer is not focused entirely on the risk. They're focused on the checkmark." - Pete
* "I expect that everyone's going to get everybody's contact informations." - Reena
* "I'll bring back to my group and definitely use the information." - Tommoito
* "So if anyone has thoughts on, you know, any even tiny bit to overcome all the problems, I'll be at the conference, please come to me and let's have a conversation." - Tommoito
* "Um, and so I think machine readability is uh is key if you want to get rid of the pre-disclosure and basically disclosing everything to to everyone then just make it public." - Thomas
* "Um, but what I think is um if you are a mature PR then you don't need a coordinator. If the researcher wants a coordinator coordinator um okay up to to the researcher um we're not uh if if somebody wants us to be in the case and we join the case but if it's not necessarily then we we try to talk to them and say hey it's a mature pet suit you can work with them and if something goes wrong you can always come back to us" - Thomas
* "So, as I mentioned, Tommo and I are a part of our global uh community of practice on coordinated vulnerability disclosure." - Reena
* "So the problem that I would like to bring up is that we also as Reena said CISA and a person from SISA and myself have been leading this uh community of practice of CBD" - Tommoito
* "It's one of the multiple ways we find vulnerabilities. I run the proactive security team. So, exposure and vulnerability management, pentest red team, AI red team, all that fun stuff." - George
* "So then we had to build this process with a third party that hey, if you want to get paid, then you got to sign up with this third party. You got to fill out information. We need to know who you actually are cuz if you want to get paid, we can't just like, you know, Bitcoin you, right?" - George
* "I mean, it's 2025. So I mean is that is it reasonable to you know to expect that any kind of responsible reporter is going to come to you?" - Dave
* "I think having um like a good vulnerability disclosure program is very important, right, which Verizon has." - George
* "So Verizon did have a bug bounty program before. I've only been there for two years. Prior to that, they went I believe it was with Hacker One and they spent like $2.5 million in one month because they didn't do appropriate testing before going to the bug bounty." - George
* "I totally agree and definitely pro that I worked at SIG group for 10 years. We have we built the public bug bounty there." - George
* "That's really the question you have to ask yourself." - Pete
* "They classify it and they put it through all the channels of people who don't really need it as opposed to those who really need it but can't get to it now because it's classified." - Pete
