SUMMARY
Stephanie Harris and Christopher Lusk discuss FedRAMP continuous monitoring trends and their impact on secure development at Red Hat.

IDEAS
* FedRAMP helps agencies adopt cloud services securely.
* Continuous monitoring involves ongoing security tasks.
* Vulnerability scans are resource-intensive in FedRAMP.
* Configuration scanning uses CIS benchmarks and STIGs.
* Manual processes don't scale with FedRAMP growth.
* CVE spikes require investigation and action.
* Image health is crucial for container security.
* Blocking unhealthy images can cause operational issues.
* Vulnerability trend analysis informs remediation.
* FedRAMP improves public CVE page information.
* FedRAMP refines vulnerability remediation timelines.
* Extended product support lifecycles are necessary.
* New teams and tools support FedRAMP compliance.
* FedRAMP improvements benefit Red Hat generally.
* Evangelism is key for FedRAMP adoption.
* Blocking poor images improves container health.
* Enforcing secure development policies is crucial.
* FedRAMP is downstream from commercial products.
* Secure development training should cover image health.
* Accountability is essential for policy adherence.
* Collaboration raises awareness of security trends.
* Trend analysis improves development processes.
* Analyzing more statistics provides deeper insights.
* Researching time-to-fix metrics is important.
* Aggregating and studying metrics promotes improvements.
* Open source aspects didn't significantly impact them.
* Educating auditors and government is essential.
* FIPS compliance can conflict with vulnerability fixes.
* NIST CMVP approval process can be slow.

INSIGHTS
* FedRAMP drives continuous security improvement.
* Balancing security and operations is crucial.
* Proactive communication is key in FedRAMP.
* Data-driven insights inform security decisions.
* Secure development practices mitigate vulnerabilities.
* FedRAMP influences broader security practices.
* Training and accountability are essential.
* Collaboration and education bridge knowledge gaps.
* Risk management is central to FedRAMP.
* FIPS compliance requires careful navigation.
