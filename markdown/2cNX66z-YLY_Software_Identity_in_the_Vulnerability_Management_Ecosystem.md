SUMMARY
Alex Hammers leads a panel with Megazone, Steve Springett, Chris Turner, and Andrew about software identification.

IDEAS
* Software vulnerability management needs trackable software for correlation.
* A multi-identifier ecosystem exists where no single identifier is sufficient.
* CVE record format now officially supports CPE identifiers for compatibility.
* The CVE quality working group supports industry-used software identifiers.
* CPE does identification, but faces scaling and applicability challenges.
* Creating applicability statements across vulnerability records is difficult.
* Increasing authoritative contributions for applicability statements is crucial.
* Package URL is a decentralized, practical approach to software identification.
* Package URL integrates with package managers, reducing human intervention.
* Primarily used for open source, Package URL also supports commercial packages.
* Package URL is stable, extensible, and undergoing ECMA standardization.
* Omniore uses inherent identifiers derived solely from the artifact itself.
* Omniore identifies concrete binaries or source files, not packages or products.
* Defined identifiers rely on central taxonomies, inherent ones don't.
* Centralized identifier production goes through a central authority like CPE.
* Federated identifiers have a central list of types, like Package URL.
* Distributed identifiers allow anyone to produce the same identifier.
* A multi-identifier future is expected in vulnerability management.
* Proper software identification is crucial for effective vulnerability management.
* Different identifier solutions offer varying levels of granularity.
* The biggest challenge is getting needed information when required.
* CPE was developed for a world with limited information availability.
* Mixing and matching identifiers allows for needed granularity.
* Market forces are driving the adoption of software identifiers.
* There's no central authority mandating identifier use yet.
* CVE organization enables identifier provision, not mandates it.
* Identifiers are crucial for tying together various security documents.
* Each identifier has strengths and weaknesses for different use cases.
* Omniore's inherent nature allows for easier cross-referencing.
* Mapping between identifiers is complex due to many-to-one relationships.
* CPE is not native to the software or hardware industry.
* Embracing multiple identifiers for different product types is beneficial.
* CPE is not a mandated standard in the CVE program, but widely used.
* The CVE program added CPE support due to industry demand and SISA pledge.
* Package URL can represent commercial software using the SWID PURL type.
* Discovering PURL SWID types is challenging due to decentralization.
* Versioning schemes and tooling remain a challenge for all identifiers.
* PURL's versioning constraints proposal reuses the CPE mechanism.

INSIGHTS
* Effective vulnerability management requires precise software identification.
* Multiple identifiers coexist, each with strengths and weaknesses.
* Collaboration and information sharing are key for accurate identification.
* The industry is moving towards a multi-identifier future.
* Centralized, federated, and distributed identifier approaches exist.
* CPE's limitations have driven the development of new identifiers.
* Package URL offers a decentralized and extensible solution.
* Omniore provides precise identification at the artifact level.
* Versioning remains a complex challenge across all identifiers.
* Making identifiers required versus possible involves trade-offs.

QUOTES
* "Effective and efficient vulnerability management requires software to be trackable." - Alex Hammers
* "There currently exists and will likely continue to exist a multi-identifier ecosystem." - Alex Hammers
* "The CVE quality working group, our job is not to solve the unified software identifier problem." - Megazone
* "It's to support what the industry is using." - Megazone
* "CPE does do identification to an extent that covers most bases." - Chris Turner
* "One of the real hard things about CPE has actually been in scaling the ability to create the applicability statements." - Chris Turner
* "Package URL has emerged as a practical and decentralized approach to software identification." - Alex Hammers
* "Because of its decentralized nature, it naturally integrates with any kind of package manager." - Steve Springett
* "Omniore is a scheme for software identity that I'll say its central distinction from CPE or PURL is that it's an inherent identifier." - Andrew
* "Defined identifiers rely on some central taxonomy, some central list." - Andrew
* "I think a multi-identifier future is to be expected." - Steve Springett
* "Each one of these different solutions kind of offers a different capability of granularity." - Chris Turner
* "The biggest struggle everybody in this room probably has is getting the information they need about the thing they need to know about when they need to know about it." - Chris Turner
* "CPE was developed in a world where we knew we wouldn't have the information we needed." - Chris Turner
* "I don't think there's any not like there's a central authority at least not yet." - Alex Hammers
* "I will say see the CVE organization mandating that we we're making it possible to for people to provide that information." - Megazone
* "I think a multi-identifier future is coming." - Steve Springett
* "CPE isn't native to the software industry." - Steve Springett
* "I welcome ecosystems where CVEs can be can can support multiple different types of identifiers." - Steve Springett
* "CPE, 2.3 is over 14 years old or 13 years old. It's totally outdated." - Audience Member
* "The printed schedule showed this was an hour the panel prepared for half an hour." - Alex Hammers
* "I think part of the problem is you're going to have a many to one relationship." - Andrew
* "As a consumer of NVD data, I think for us, one of the biggest difficulties is that CNAs are in charge of their CVEs." - Audience Member
* "I am 100% in favor of CNA ADPs." - Megazone
