SUMMARY
Nick Leali, CVSSI co-chair, discusses CVSS version 4, its differences from version 3, adoption challenges, and future directions.

IDEAS
* CVSS version 4 introduces significant changes, not just an incremental update.
* The math and assumptions in version 4 differ, impacting risk decisions.
* Qualitative boundaries shift, changing vulnerability classifications.
* Cisco's data shows a slight average score increase and boundary shifts.
* CVE program data reveals a smaller average change and more shifts.
* GitHub data shows significant increases and boundary shifts.
* Unreviewed GitHub data reveals even more boundary shifts.
* CVSS base score alone lacks context for risk-based decisions.
* Use the full vector string and other systems for better decisions.
* Avoid making promises solely based on CVSS scores.
* Provide more context to help customers make informed decisions.
* Qualitative ratings remain important; deviate when necessary.
* Use the full vector string for better risk-based decisions.
* The provided tool helps analyze CVSS version 4 impacts.
* CVSS does not equal risk; consider environmental factors.
* Don't solely rely on CVSS for risk-based decisions.
* CVSS version 4 aims to give more space for threat and environmental factors.
* Few organizations have fully adopted CVSS version 4 yet.
* Converting old 3.1 scores to 4.0 is a common practice.
* The new standard adds context and useful features.
* CVSS version 4 adoption may seem slow due to various challenges.
* The survey reveals most organizations find version 4 worthwhile.
* Many organizations use CVSS with other scoring systems.
* The survey results guide future CVSS SIG efforts.
* An enhanced user guide will help improve CVSS usage.
* Per-platform CVSS assessments are being explored.
* Version 4.1 is not expected soon; a documentation update is planned.
* Join the SIG or provide feedback to get involved.
