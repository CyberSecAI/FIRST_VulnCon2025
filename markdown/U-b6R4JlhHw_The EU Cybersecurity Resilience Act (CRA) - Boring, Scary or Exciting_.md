SUMMARY
Mike Bessel discusses the EU Cyber Resilience Act (CRA), focusing on manufacturers, stewards, and maintainers of open-source software.

IDEAS
* Open-source stewards act as intermediaries between maintainers and manufacturers.
* The CRA aims to improve cybersecurity for products with digital elements sold in the EU.
* Manufacturers selling products with digital elements in the EU are subject to the CRA.
* The CRA addresses vulnerabilities in open-source code used in commercial products.
* Open-source maintainers have no obligations under the CRA.
* The CRA promotes better cybersecurity practices and processes.
* Vulnerability and incident management are key aspects of the CRA.
* Dependency management is crucial for compliance with the CRA.
* Conformance testing and audits are required under the CRA.
* The level of conformance testing depends on the product's classification.
* Risk assessment is central to the EU CRA and its implementation.
* The CRA encourages supporting open-source projects and stewards.
* The economics of open-source stewardship are still being developed.
* Companies should determine their role (manufacturer, steward, or maintainer).
* Collaboration and communication within the ecosystem are essential.
* The CRA aims to reduce "jumping off" attacks and chaining vulnerabilities.
* Products with digital elements include hardware and software components.
* The CRA applies to products sold in the EU, regardless of hosting location.
* Services integrated with physical products are covered by the CRA.
* Existing legislation may take precedence over the CRA in some sectors.
* The CRA requires documentation of risk assessments and design.
* Submitted documentation for conformance is not made public.
* Open-source stewards have limited liability under the CRA.
* Manufacturers should contribute resources to support open-source stewards.
* The CRA mandates five years of security updates from the last change.
* Standards are being developed to aid compliance with the CRA.
* Penalties for non-compliance can reach 2.5% of global turnover.

INSIGHTS
* The CRA shifts responsibility for open-source security to manufacturers.
* Supporting open-source stewards is crucial for long-term software security.
* The CRA aims to create a more robust and secure digital ecosystem.
* Proactive cybersecurity practices are essential for compliance and security.
* Collaboration and resource sharing are key to meeting CRA requirements.
* The CRA's impact extends beyond the EU due to global software supply chains.
* Balancing open-source principles with commercial interests is a challenge.
* The CRA necessitates a shift in mindset towards continuous security improvement.
* Clear roles and responsibilities are essential for navigating the CRA.
* The CRA promotes a more sustainable and secure open-source ecosystem.
