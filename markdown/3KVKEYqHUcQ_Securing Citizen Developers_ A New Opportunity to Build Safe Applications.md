SUMMARY
Kayla Underoffer discusses citizen development, its security risks, and strategies for building secure applications within these environments.

IDEAS
* Citizen developers are business users building applications with low-code/no-code platforms.
* These platforms empower non-IT staff to create software, fostering innovation.
* Citizen development poses security risks due to lack of IT and security expertise.
* Build-time risks involve choices made during application construction.
* Runtime risks arise when agents execute actions in live environments.
* Authorization misuse occurs when credentials are shared inappropriately.
* Authentication failures expose applications to unauthorized access.
* Data and secrets handling mistakes can lead to sensitive data exposure.
* Prompt injection can manipulate AI agents to perform unintended actions.
* Curious AI, or hallucinations, can lead to misinformation and errors.
* Sensitive data exfiltration and jailbreaking are runtime attack vectors.
* Build-time choices directly impact the attack surface in runtime.
* Risk reduction is possible through visibility, assessment, and remediation.
* Leverage platform capabilities for inventorying applications and data flows.
* Understand critical data and prioritize environments accordingly.
* Establish a culture of documentation from the outset.
* Risk assessment involves analyzing how applications are built.
* Automated scanning is crucial for efficient risk identification.
* Silent remediation allows for fixing issues without developer intervention.
* Manual campaigns address issues requiring developer action.
* Prevention involves setting guardrails and educating developers.
* Lean on platform capabilities for automated guardrails and remediation.
* Collaborate with the business to define security standards.
* Meet makers where they are and communicate effectively.
* Automate communication and use platform-specific language.
* Silent remediation should be followed by developer education.
* Set clear security standards and enforce them technically.
* Microsoft's journey to securing their environment is a valuable example.
* Assess visibility, risk assessment, remediation, and prevention strategies.
* Reducing risk in citizen development environments is achievable.

INSIGHTS
* Citizen development empowers business users but introduces unique security risks.
* Build-time decisions significantly influence runtime security posture.
* Proactive risk management is essential in citizen development environments.
* Leverage platform features and automation for efficient security.
* Collaboration and education are key to fostering a secure culture.
* Silent remediation offers a powerful tool for mitigating risks.
* Establishing clear security policies and standards is crucial.
* Risk reduction in citizen development is an ongoing journey.
* Visibility and control are paramount in these environments.
* Balancing innovation and security is the core challenge.
