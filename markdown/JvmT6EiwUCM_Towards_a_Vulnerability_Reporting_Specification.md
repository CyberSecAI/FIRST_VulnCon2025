SUMMARY
Matinska and Mikuel discuss the Open Regulatory Compliance (OC) working group's vulnerability management specification for open source projects to comply with the CRA.

IDEAS
* Open source projects need vulnerability management specifications.
* The Eclipse Foundation hosts and stewards open source projects.
* The OC working group created a vulnerability management specification.
* The specification aims to be short, easy to use, and understand.
* It leverages existing best practices in vulnerability reporting.
* The specification is consistent with the CRA requirements.
* It's tailored for open source but applicable to companies.
* The specification is available under an open-source license.
* The goal isn't to create a new standard, but to meet CRA needs.
* Existing standards are costly, enterprise-focused, or non-prescriptive.
* The specification has five main goals: short, common standards, CRA consistency, open source focus, and availability.
* The approach involves assembling best practices and creating clear requirements.
* The first draft is two pages long and open for community discussion.
* The project is available on GitHub for contributions.
* Musts include a vulnerability handling process, coordinated vulnerability disclosure, and reporting policy.
* The timeline aims for an RC1 by the end of April.
* The goal is to provide the document to regulators for guidance.
* Harmonized standards are requested by the European Commission.
* The specification serves as community input to standard organizations.
* The process aims for consensus within the open-source community.
* The same process will be used for other CRA requirements.
* Feedback and contributions are welcome from anyone.
* The current draft is a starting point for discussion.
* Tools for compliance are outside the current scope.
* Other organizations are working on tools for CRA compliance.
* The specifications are provided as input to tool makers.
* The European Commission is creating an attestation program.
* Case laws will ultimately decide compliance.
* The commission will issue guidance on compliance.

INSIGHTS
* Open-source collaboration is key for developing effective, practical specifications.
* The CRA presents a challenge and opportunity for open-source vulnerability management.
* A short, prescriptive specification can guide open-source projects toward CRA compliance.
* Community consensus and existing best practices are essential for specification development.
* The specification bridges the gap between open source and regulatory requirements.
* Collaboration between open source communities and regulators is crucial for compliance.
* Practical tools are needed to help open-source projects implement the specification.
* The specification aims to simplify CRA compliance for open-source projects.
* The open-source community is actively shaping the future of regulatory compliance.
* The specification development process is iterative and open to feedback.

QUOTES
* "We are an open source software foundation." - Mikuel Barau
* "We host and steward open source projects." - Mikuel Barau
* "Our goal is really to focus on the CRA requirements." - Matinska
* "The goal is definitely not to create one new standard." - Matinska
* "It's nonprescriptive. So you cannot really define by following this guide whether you comply or not." - Matinska
* "We want to have it as short as possible so it's easy to use and understand." - Matinska
* "We want to reach an agreement in the community of what is the core set that everyone agrees with." - Matinska
* "The first draft is available and it's around two pages." - Matinska
* "You can find it in the OC working group GitHub organization." - Matinska
* "There is nothing shocking or nothing that should be really controversy for anybody." - Mikuel Barau
* "Please join the discussions and provide comments and feedbacks." - Mikuel Barau
* "The main goal is to be able to provide such document to the regulators." - Mikuel Barau
* "We also want to provide this specification as an input to those standard organization." - Mikuel Barau
* "It's a open source way of collaborating." - Mikuel Barau
* "Any feedback is welcome." - Matinska
* "The tools is a bit outside of the scope at least for now." - Mikuel Barau
* "We are collaborating with some of them." - Mikuel Barau
* "I'm shocked that you have all of this in two pages." - Audience Member
* "How are you trying to both keep it consumable and simple enough for everyone to understand, but also be comprehensive enough and prescriptive enough?" - Audience Member
* "We didn't tell you two pages in which font size." - Matinska
* "We know what the typical use cases are and they are not that hard to extract." - Matinska
* "The CRA in my reading of the CRA stays pretty generic." - Matinska
* "Can anyone provide comments and feedback even if not part of the open source implementers community?" - Liliana (Discord)

HABITS
* Collaborate with open-source communities for feedback and contributions.

* Work iteratively and incorporate feedback from the community.
* Clearly define roles and responsibilities for vulnerability handling.
* Establish a structured process for dealing with vulnerabilities.
* Publish all resolved vulnerabilities for transparency.
* Link to external guidelines for detailed procedures.
* Participate in industry discussions and working groups.
* Engage with regulators to provide input and seek guidance.
* Use version control systems like Git for collaboration.

FACTS
