SUMMARY
Diogo Monica presents on the vulnerability response of last resort for undermaintained open-source packages.

IDEAS
* Open-source software components are used in almost all software today.
* Package growth in open source is exponential, a moving target.
* Maintainers are scarce, like Dhaka, always needed for packages.
* Package growth leads to package decay; old packages are forgotten.
* Undermaintained packages have a single or few maintainers.
* CVEs are increasing, but not all vulnerabilities get assigned CVEs.
* Assigning CVEs to training apps or test software is inappropriate.
* More resources lead to quicker and better vulnerability outcomes.
* False positives in understaffed projects may not be contested.
* Public issues on GitHub can expose vulnerabilities without CVEs.
* Abandoned packages can contain unmerged pull requests with fixes.
* Many old vulnerabilities may exist in abandoned packages.
* Some packages are abandoned with no known alternatives.
* The "vulnerability responder of last resort" helps connect reporters.
* Distros can help connect reporters to maintainers of packages.
* This helps structure communication and make reports actionable.
* Distros can assist maintainers with triage and disclosure.
* This helps maintainers assign CVEs and coordinate patches.
* This approach benefits the collective open-source ecosystem.
* Identifying abandoned packages is difficult; activity isn't everything.
* Crystallized packages may have no activity intentionally.
* Alternatives are needed when critical packages are abandoned.
* Collective action is needed for the good of open source.
* The proposal aims to be a beacon of help for maintainers.
* Gathering data on lurking vulnerabilities is important.
* Assisting reporters in finding the right contacts is crucial.
* Helping maintainers coordinate disclosures is beneficial.
* Identifying and addressing abandoned packages is key.

INSIGHTS
* The abundance of open-source software contrasts with the scarcity of maintainers.
* The rapid growth of open source creates a challenge in maintaining existing packages.
* Unmaintained packages pose a significant security risk due to unaddressed vulnerabilities.
* The current CVE system doesn't capture all vulnerabilities, especially in abandoned projects.
* False positives and negatives can hinder effective vulnerability management.
* Public vulnerability disclosures can be a double-edged sword.
* Distros can play a vital role in coordinating vulnerability response for undermaintained packages.
* A "vulnerability responder of last resort" can bridge the gap between reporters and maintainers.
* Identifying abandoned packages requires nuanced criteria beyond simple activity metrics.
* A proactive approach is needed to address the security risks of abandoned packages.

QUOTES
* "Maintainers of packages are like Dhaka. And you always need more Dhaka." - Diogo Monica

* "Open source is pretty much everywhere." - Diogo Monica
* "Anecdotes are not data." - Diogo Monica
* "There are only two kinds of languages: the ones people complain about and the ones nobody uses." - Diogo Monica
* "Having more CVE IDs assigned is a good thing." - Diogo Monica
* "What about the ocean that sits behind that wave?" - Diogo Monica
* "The void also stares back." - Diogo Monica
* "More resources tend to lead to quicker and better outcomes." - Diogo Monica
* "Keeping false positives around creates compliance problems down the line." - Diogo Monica
* "This is the worst outcome." - Diogo Monica
* "What ends up being inside that four square box where we fit it to the top slot? Well, dragons." - Diogo Monica
* "I wonder how long it has been there, at least 2016 or previous discovery, and what might have been done with it." - Diogo Monica
* "That's the beauty of compiling from source. They don't have to be." - Diogo Monica
* "People know better than to use abandoned packages." - Diogo Monica
* "But sometimes no alternatives exist." - Diogo Monica
* "The maintainer is gone. What do we do here?" - Diogo Monica
* "You're search queries away from finding orphan issues and orphan projects that just might be security related." - Diogo Monica
* "Who knows what zero days or 10-year days, wait, does that count?" - Diogo Monica
* "In essence, when we are looking at abandoned packages and vulnerabilities in them, it's what happens to the hole when the cheese is gone." - Diogo Monica
