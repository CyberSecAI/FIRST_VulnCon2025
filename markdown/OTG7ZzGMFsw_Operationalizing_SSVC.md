SUMMARY
Lindsay Sirnik and Sean Latona from CISA present on operationalizing Stakeholder-Specific Vulnerability Categorization (SSVC).

IDEAS
* SSVC helps prioritize vulnerabilities based on stakeholder concerns and exploitation status.
* CVSS is useful for technical understanding, but SSVC considers wider stakeholder impacts.
* CISA uses SSVC to focus on exploitation, prevalence, and mission impact of vulnerabilities.
* SSVC is a decision tree model enabling repeatable and consistent vulnerability triage.
* CISA has used SSVC for five years, with success in the KEV catalog.
* SSVC decision outcomes: Track, Monitor, Attend, and Act, escalating in severity.
* Decision outcomes facilitate communication and action across organizational groups.
* SSVC allows for quick decisions on actions based on vulnerability scores.
* CISA uses SSVC to drive remediation and mitigation actions across the federal government.
* Actions range from awareness campaigns to emergency directives.
* SSVC helps spin down attention on vulnerabilities as their impact diminishes.
* Executive buy-in and analyst understanding are crucial for SSVC success.
* SSVC aligns with threat hunting and incident response efforts.
* Iterative improvement and adaptability are key to SSVC effectiveness.
* Different SSVC trees may be needed for different triages and stakeholder groups.
* CISA shares SSVC information publicly to enhance cybersecurity efforts.
* SSVC enrichment is shared publicly via GitHub and authorized data publishers.
* Internal tracking of SSVC scoring includes mission prevalence and well-being.
* Qualitative and quantitative sources inform SSVC scoring decisions.
* Analyst experience plays a significant role in SSVC assessments.
* Less than 10% of enriched vulnerabilities are further scored internally.
* Approximately 8% of further scored vulnerabilities are actioned by CISA.
* Future developments include incorporating SSVC into more tools and dashboards.
* CISA is exploring an SSVC tree for operational technology and ICS.
* Public resources on SSVC are available on CISA's website.

INSIGHTS
* SSVC bridges the gap between technical vulnerability analysis and stakeholder impact.
* Prioritization with SSVC enables efficient resource allocation for vulnerability management.
* Collaboration and communication are enhanced through shared SSVC decision outcomes.
* SSVC facilitates proactive vulnerability management by focusing on exploitation status.
* Transparency and information sharing are central to CISA's approach to SSVC.
* Continuous improvement and adaptation are essential for maximizing SSVC's value.
* Organizational buy-in is crucial for successful implementation of SSVC.
* SSVC empowers informed decision-making regarding vulnerability response actions.
* Context-specific vulnerability assessment is enabled through customizable SSVC trees.
* SSVC supports a proactive and risk-based approach to cybersecurity.

QUOTES
* "We recognize that the vulnerabilities that pose the biggest threat... are those already being exploited." - Lindsay Sirnik
* "SSVC... enables an organization to walk through a repeated decision-making process." - Lindsay Sirnik
* "SISA has organizationally made decisions about how they want to implement SSVC." - Lindsay Sirnik
* "SSVC has a pretty good amount of flexibility for any organization that wants to implement it." - Lindsay Sirnik
* "SSVC allows us to really focus on the state of exploitation, the prevalence, and the mission impact." - Lindsay Sirnik
* "These decision outcomes elevate our analysis... into a conversation that can be passed from one group to the other." - Lindsay Sirnik
* "SSVC has given us a framework to derive a menu of options." - Sean Latona
* "Most of our action that we take involves communication." - Sean Latona
* "SSVC really gives us a great tool to... spin down." - Sean Latona
* "It's focused on mission impact, exploitability, and prevalence." - Sean Latona
* "A prerequisite to success in using the SSVC is you have to have buy-in." - Sean Latona
* "If you're running up against friction with your SSVC system, it's the system that needs to be changed." - Lindsay Sirnik
* "We want to share what we can publicly." - Lindsay Sirnik
* "Full enrichment has made this way easier because people can just ingest SSVC as a JSON." - Lindsay Sirnik

HABITS
* Consistently apply SSVC for repeatable vulnerability prioritization.
* Collaborate with stakeholders to understand their specific concerns.
* Continuously evaluate and improve the SSVC process for optimal effectiveness.
* Focus on vulnerabilities that are actively being exploited in the wild.
* Tailor communication strategies based on the SSVC decision outcome.
* Maintain open communication channels between analysis and action teams.
* Leverage both quantitative and qualitative data for informed scoring.
* Prioritize vulnerabilities based on mission impact and prevalence.
* Share information publicly to promote transparency and collaboration.
* Seek executive buy-in and ensure analyst understanding of SSVC.
* Regularly brief stakeholders on SSVC and its implementation.
* Incorporate SSVC into various tools and dashboards for wider adoption.
* Explore different SSVC trees for diverse technology environments.
* Conduct thorough training to ensure consistent application of SSVC.
* Utilize decision trees for personal decision-making in various contexts.

FACTS
* 40,000 vulnerabilities are disclosed every year, requiring effective prioritization.
* CISA's KEV catalog is supported and enforced by a binding operational directive.
* CISA hosts weekly briefings on emerging vulnerabilities for federal agencies.
* CISA provides mitigation guidance and hunt guides for various threats.
* CVE 2023-20593 (Zenbleed) affected billions of AMD chips.
* CVSS scored Zenbleed at 9.8, highlighting the need for context-aware scoring.
* CISA has scored over 46,000 vulnerabilities using SSVC since early 2024.
* Less than 10% of publicly enriched vulnerabilities are further scored internally.
* Approximately 3% of internally scored vulnerabilities result in "Act" decisions.
* CISA uses scanning results and public acquisition records for SSVC scoring.
