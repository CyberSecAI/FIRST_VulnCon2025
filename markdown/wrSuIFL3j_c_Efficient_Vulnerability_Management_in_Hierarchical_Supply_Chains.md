SUMMARY
Toby and Tom KD from Siemens discuss vulnerability management challenges within their diverse product ecosystem and supply chain.

IDEAS
* Siemens develops diverse products, from industrial controllers to software and integrated solutions.
* Vulnerability management is crucial due to the increasing number of vulnerabilities and data.
* The "Bermuda Triangle" refers to undiscovered or unpublished vulnerabilities.
* Siemens established a CNA ecosystem in 2016 to improve vulnerability handling.
* Software Bill of Materials (SBOMs) and VEX provide vulnerability information for components.
* The challenge lies in handling the exponential growth of vulnerabilities in the supply chain.
* CVSS scores change as components are embedded in different environments.
* Vulnerability descriptions should be tailored to the end-user's context.
* Cross-organizational data exchange and standardized formats are crucial.
* Different tools are used for different use cases along the supply chain.
* Recursively taking dependencies and distributing them creates a complex problem.
* A single vulnerability can affect multiple products with varying CVSS scores.
* Siemens aims to improve information flow across the supply chain.
* Transparency on upstream and downstream vulnerability ratings is a goal.
* The focus is on making different tools interact effectively.
* Product teams are central to vulnerability management efforts.
* SBOMs provide information about product components.
* A product mapping database helps identify components across different tools.
* Vulnerability intelligence stores the impact of vulnerabilities.
* CVE database, CSAF advisories, GitHub Security Advisory, and OSV feed vulnerability intelligence.
* Vulnerability scanners are another source of vulnerability information.
* Duplicate vulnerability notifications are a challenge.
* Adapting SBOMs for vulnerability management can help reduce duplicates.
* SBOMs can act as a routing mechanism to ask the right people about vulnerabilities.
* Transparency of rated vulnerabilities is essential.
* Internal vulnerability forwarding is crucial to avoid overlooking vulnerabilities.
* The CVE database needs adequate coverage of vulnerabilities.
* Component mapping is a problem for environments without package managers.
* Greenfield projects can use package managers, but brownfield projects cannot.
* Duplicate vulnerability notifications are a challenge.
* Adapting SBOMs can help reduce duplicates by focusing on necessary components.
* Transparency of rated vulnerabilities is important for data sharing.

INSIGHTS
* Effective vulnerability management requires collaboration across the supply chain.
* Context-specific vulnerability descriptions are crucial for end-users.
* Standardized formats and data exchange are key for efficient vulnerability handling.
* The increasing complexity of software supply chains demands better tooling and processes.
* Engaging product teams is essential for successful vulnerability management.
* SBOMs play a vital role in understanding and managing vulnerabilities.
* Vulnerability intelligence helps prioritize and address vulnerabilities effectively.
* Adapting SBOMs can improve efficiency and reduce duplicate notifications.
* Transparency and data sharing are crucial for collective vulnerability management.
* Legacy systems pose unique challenges for component mapping and vulnerability management.

QUOTES
* "Basically in 2016, the CNA ecosystem was created. So Siemens got its own CNA." - Tom KD
* "So basically the problem that we're seeing is exponential in multiple dimensions." - Tom KD
* "So it's really not useful at all to have the original vulnerability description of a vulnerability inside Zetlip for an end customer of Siemens who's a factory operator." - Tom KD
* "So basically our focus is really to make sure that the different tools that are written for partly different use cases interact in a good way." - Tom KD
* "Basically the recursive problem is kind of the same across every layer of that chain, but the technical implementation or the tooling around that might be very, very different according to the specific use case." - Tom KD
* "Everything in our vision is centered around the product teams because we can have the most amazing tooling. If the product teams do not use it, we're lost." - Tom KD
* "We need the information from the product teams because they are the experts." - Tom KD
* "These concepts are in theory amazing, but in practice don't work, at least for us." - Tom KD
* "It is of utterly importance that we use the same vulnerability intelligence data along the entire supply chain." - Tom KD
* "We want to go into the direction of using package managers for almost everything. However, that's only possible for greenfield projects." - Toby
* "So the new projects, the modern projects, modern DevOps projects." - Toby
* "We only can make the future better in that regard here actually." - Toby
* "Try to see the SBOM as kind of a routing mechanism." - Toby
* "If you're a vulnerability vendor, then please talk to us." - Tom KD
* "This is a missing gap, and this is basically the punch line of this talk." - Tom KD
* "We as a society, we as an economy need to somehow improve on naming things and talking about the same things with the same names." - Tom KD
* "We face quite a lot of challenges in the card here." - Tom KD
* "So they really want to be sure that all of those vulner... certain vulnerabilities applicable so that they have a good decision actually to invest all of that money." - Tom KD
* "I say, guys, we're going to have to ask you to take this offline. We are over time." - Kind

HABITS
* Siemens vulnerability management team prioritizes information flow.
* They analyze vulnerabilities based on project type and age.
* They leverage AI to improve component identification and mapping.
* They adapt SBOMs to focus on necessary components for vulnerability management.
* They collaborate with vulnerability vendors to improve data exchange.
* They encourage the use of package managers in new projects.
* They prioritize patching in cloud infrastructure projects.
* They conduct in-depth vulnerability evaluations for embedded devices.
* They use a central vulnerability tracker to request impact information.
* They rely on product teams' expertise to assess vulnerabilities.
