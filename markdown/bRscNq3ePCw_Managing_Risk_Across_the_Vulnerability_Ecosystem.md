SUMMARY
Trisha, Julia, and Cassie discuss Dell's product security strategy, focusing on dependency management, third-party risk, and incident response.

IDEAS
* Open-source software assurance uses a trustworthiness score for guidance.
* Developers must use a trusted repository for open-source components.
* Standardized supplier information feeds into the dependency management platform.
* Supplier trustworthiness scores aid in future negotiations and risk management.
* Dependency management feeds SBOMs to customers and internal metrics.
* Vulnerability reports and VEX application help stay ahead of customer needs.
* Dependency management arose from Log4j and executive order 14028.
* High-quality inventory is crucial for effective SBOM generation.
* Standardized supplier naming improves inventory analysis and oversight.
* The ultimate goal is providing trustworthy code to customers.
* Supplier onboarding involves risk assessment and due diligence questionnaires.
* Continuous monitoring ensures emerging risks are identified and addressed.
* Post-contract accountability involves escalating unresolved security issues.
* Supplier remediation effectiveness KPIs track responsiveness and fixes.
* Rigorous TPRM practices increase customer trust and brand confidence.
* PERT uses DMP and TPRM outputs to improve incident response.
* Open-source software trustworthiness helps developers make better choices.
* Supplier SBOMs enable mapping dependencies and assessing impact.
* Supplier risk ratings inform which suppliers need closer monitoring.
* Security requirement agreements provide leverage in supplier negotiations.
* Machine-readable advisories and VEX statements enhance customer transparency.
* Faster vulnerability response improves customer trust and compliance.
* A product 360 dashboard provides executives with a holistic view.
* The long-term goal is correlating source and binary inventories.

INSIGHTS
* Trustworthiness scores guide open-source software selection and supplier assessments.
* A centralized repository ensures secure and approved open-source component usage.
* Standardized data and processes enhance dependency management and risk mitigation.
* SBOMs, VEX, and vulnerability reports improve transparency and customer trust.
* Proactive vulnerability management helps stay ahead of potential security threats.
* High-quality inventory data is essential for effective SBOM generation and analysis.
* Continuous monitoring and escalation processes ensure timely issue resolution.
* Supplier accountability and performance are tracked through KPIs and agreements.
* Rigorous TPRM practices build customer confidence and protect the ecosystem.
* Collaboration between PERT, DMP, and TPRM improves incident response.

QUOTES
* "Inventory is really how we look at it, so inventory is the intake." - Trisha
* "Everybody talks about SBOMs, but if you don't have the inventory in a quality format and you know what you're doing..." - Trisha
* "The ultimate goal here is to provide trustworthy code to our customers." - Trisha
* "This is all about shifting left, right? Helping product teams make better choices." - Trisha
* "Regular risk assessments and continuous monitoring are vital to identify and mitigate these vulnerabilities." - Julia
* "We intend to hold our suppliers and partners to the same rigorous standards that we hold ourselves to." - Julia
* "TPRM is a vital component of any product security strategy." - Julia
* "The end goal is increased customer trust." - Julia
* "We're really going to start becoming the ultimate consumers, right?" - Cassie
* "Our goal is to do that via an API where customers can just pull down our advisories, pull in our VEX statements." - Cassie
* "Customers really benefit from these machine-readable advisories and from SCA and VEX." - Cassie

HABITS
* Check for quality based on the document and included fields.
* Build wrappers around processes for checks and quality control.
* Kick back substandard inventories to BUs for updates.
* Require product teams to register inventory for tracking.
* Standardize supplier naming for consistent identification.
* Conduct regular risk assessments and continuous monitoring.
* Follow a comprehensive onboarding process for new suppliers.
* Develop corrective action plans for identified supplier gaps.
* Set up continuous monitoring based on supplier risk scores.
* Track key metrics like responsiveness and effectiveness percentage.
* Escalate unresolved security issues through established channels.
* Leverage security requirement agreements in supplier negotiations.
* Publish advisories and VEX statements via an API for easy access.
* Use SCA results to automatically open tickets for affected teams.

FACTS
* Log4j vulnerability highlighted the need for better dependency management.
* Executive Order 14028 mandates understanding of all software components.
* SPDX 2.3 is used for both intake and export of SBOMs.
* Third-party suppliers can introduce vulnerabilities into the ecosystem.
* Delays in resolving security issues can increase vulnerability exposure.
* NIST Cybersecurity Framework informs supplier security questionnaires.
* SBOMs are static documents reflecting the content at release time.
* VEX statements provide dynamic, point-in-time vulnerability information.
* Machine-readable advisories and VEX benefit customers and automation.
* Effective TPRM practices enhance overall security posture and compliance.
