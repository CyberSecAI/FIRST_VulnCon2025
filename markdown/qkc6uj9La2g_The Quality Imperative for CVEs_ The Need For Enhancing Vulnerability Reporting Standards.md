SUMMARY
Jerry Gamblin discusses CVE data quality issues, including incomplete information, schema problems, and lack of standardization.

IDEAS
* CVE records often have incomplete or inaccurate information, hindering their usefulness.
* Only three fields are required for CVE publication, leading to minimal data.
* CVE and NVD schemas lack clear descriptions and data type specifications.
* Multiple CVE data sources exist, creating inconsistencies and confusion.
* Open-source projects struggle to use CVE data due to access and format issues.
* CVSS, CPE, and CWE should be mandatory fields for better data quality.
* References should be integrated into CVE records for long-term accessibility.
* Standardized tooling is needed for CVE publication and quality control.
* AI tooling could improve CVE descriptions, CWE, CVSS, and CPE suggestions.
* CVE program should support existing open-source tooling like Vulnogram.
* A robust validation process is crucial for ensuring CVE data accuracy.
* An open-source working group could improve CVE tooling collaboration.
* Formalized CNA tooling is needed for consistent and enriched data.
* Data consumers need to be considered in CVE program development.
* Hackathons and data science competitions could promote CVE data usage.
* Clear communication channels are needed for community engagement.
* Certification programs could improve CNA and data consumer knowledge.
* Public reporting on CNA data quality could drive improvements.
* Community involvement from diverse stakeholders is essential.
* Enforcing existing rules is a necessary first step for improvement.
* Minimum quality standards for CVE records are a no-brainer.
* Education and training for CNAs and data consumers are important.
* Broader community engagement beyond PERT teams is needed.
* Standardized reporting on CNA data quality should be implemented.
* CVE quality is crucial for both CNAs and data consumers.
* A steady, incremental approach to adding validation is needed.
* Focusing on valid but minimally useful CVE records is important.

INSIGHTS
* Improving CVE data quality requires a multi-faceted approach.
* Mandatory fields, standardized tooling, and validation are key.
* Community involvement and open communication are essential.
* Focusing on data consumers will improve CVE data utility.
* Incremental improvements and enforcement of existing rules are crucial.
* Balancing ease of publication with data quality is a challenge.
* AI can play a role in enhancing CVE data quality.
* Open-source collaboration is vital for CVE tooling development.
* Certification and training can empower both CNAs and consumers.
* Transparency through public reporting can drive accountability.
