* "CNAs know their vulnerabilities and their products best. They're the ones sitting with the code." - Julia Turkovich
* "Good habits look like complete, accurate, and timely record publication." - Julia Turkovich
* "Knowing a vulnerability exists doesn't really help anyone. Publishing a CVE and adding enriched information is helpful." - Julia Turkovich
* "CVE is the public's definitive source for publicly disclosed vulnerabilities, and it's only as valuable as the data we input into it." - Julia Turkovich
