SUMMARY
Shelby Cunningham discusses CVSS 4.0's exploit maturity metric, its benefits, and how it addresses vulnerability over scoring.

IDEAS
* Exploit maturity enhances CVE records by reflecting exploit status.
* CVSS 4.0 overscoring can lead to alert fatigue due to increased critical vulnerabilities.
* Exploit maturity helps align CVSS 4.0 scores with maintainer expectations.
* "Attacked" signifies in-the-wild exploitation, the most severe level.
* "Proof of Concept" indicates public exploit code but no wild exploitation.
* "Unreported" signifies no public exploit code or exploitation attempts.
* Exploit maturity helps convey vulnerability seriousness to downstream consumers.
* Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) database offers trustworthy exploitation data.
* EPSS considers past exploitation as a factor in scoring.
* CVSS 4.0 allows indicating exploitation without additional data.
* Maintainers can use exploit maturity to highlight vulnerability severity.
* CVSS 4.0 offers more specific impact information than 3.1.
* Exploit maturity helped a maintainer accurately represent a vulnerability's severity.
* CVE 2023-39363 demonstrates the use of exploit maturity in a real-world case.
* CVSS 4.0 can better align with maintainer expectations using exploit maturity levels.
* Overscoring can be mitigated by using "proof of concept" or "unreported."
* Including exploit maturity information is generally better than omitting it.
* CVSS base metrics don't include exploit maturity, limiting some tools.
* There's no hard deadline for transitioning from CVSS 3.1 to 4.0.
* Exploit maturity was introduced in CVSS 4.0, not present in 3.1.
* GitHub uses both CVSS 3.1 and 4.0 for better score concordance.
* Authenticated denial-of-service example illustrates exploit maturity usage.
* Inconsistent application of exploit maturity can skew risk evaluation.
* Finding a universal vulnerability scoring system is challenging.
* Some inconsistency in scoring is inevitable due to software diversity.
* GitHub's dual role as CVE producer and consumer adds complexity.
* Defining "known exploited vulnerability" for KEV has nuances.

INSIGHTS
* Exploit maturity in CVSS 4.0 provides valuable context for vulnerability prioritization.
* Addressing CVSS over scoring improves the accuracy and effectiveness of vulnerability management.
* Clear communication of exploit status is crucial for informed decision-making.
* Using exploit maturity strategically can enhance vulnerability reporting and response.
* Multiple tools and databases offer complementary approaches to identifying exploited vulnerabilities.
* Balancing worst-case scenarios with nuanced exploit information is key for effective risk assessment.
* Context-specific scoring adjustments are sometimes necessary for accurate vulnerability representation.
* Consistency in applying exploit maturity is ideal but challenging in practice.
* The evolving nature of vulnerability data requires flexible and adaptable scoring systems.
* Collaboration between maintainers, CNAs, and security researchers is essential for accurate vulnerability assessment.

QUOTES
* "This metric measures the likelihood of the vulnerability being attacked." - Shelby Cunningham
* "In general, you're going to want things to be less bad when possible." - Shelby Cunningham
* "Very few vulnerabilities have solid proof of being exploited in the wild." - Shelby Cunningham
* "If something's on KEV, you know it's been exploited." - Shelby Cunningham
* "Past exploitation is not the only factor when it comes to EPSS." - Shelby Cunningham
* "This was able to warn them, you know, both A, your device is going to be bricked, and B, this has happened in the wild." - Shelby Cunningham
* "CVE 2023-39363 was exploited in the wild." - Shelby Cunningham
* "It's not a necessity if someone doesn't want that information out there." - Shelby Cunningham
* "Sometimes you do want to start with finding something that has been exploited in the wild." - Shelby Cunningham
* "It's very valuable to have those specific scores." - Shelby Cunningham
* "It may be more appropriate to assume the worst-case scenario and bring it down." - Shelby Cunningham
* "One scoring system for assessing vulnerabilities in all software is pretty hard." - Shelby Cunningham
* "Some squishiness and some level of inconsistency is somewhat inevitable." - Shelby Cunningham
* "GitHub exists in an interesting place in CNA land." - Shelby Cunningham

HABITS
* Curates CVE records to generate information for Dependabot alerts.
* Scores CVSS for maintainers who don't want to or don't know how.
* Considers other CNA practices and maintainer/consumer perspectives.
* Uses exploit maturity to help maintainers convey vulnerability seriousness.
* Consults first documentation on CVSS 4.0 to ensure accurate understanding.
* Attends and learns from various security talks and conferences.
* Collaborates with maintainers to refine CVSS scores and messaging.
* Prioritizes accurately representing the maintainer's perspective on vulnerabilities.
* Aims for concordance between CVSS 3.1 and 4.0 scores.
* Uses proof of concept or unreported to align scores with expectations.
* Adapts scoring approaches based on the specific software and context.
* Acknowledges the difficulty of consistent scoring across diverse software.
* Remains open to feedback and different perspectives on scoring practices.

FACTS
* CVSS 4.0 introduces an exploit maturity metric.
* CVSS 4.0 tends to score vulnerabilities higher than 3.1.
* Mend.io data shows a significant increase in critical and high severity alerts in 4.0.
* CVE 2023-39363's CVSS score reflects its exploitation in the wild.
* The Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) database tracks exploited vulnerabilities.
* EPSS incorporates past exploitation into its scoring.
* GitHub serves as a CNA, handling CVE records and advisories.
* NVD and other data providers often assume worst-case scenarios.
* Older vulnerability data can make determining exploitation status difficult.
* Some tools only recognize CVSS base metrics, not exploit maturity.
* There is no mandated deadline for switching to CVSS 4.0.
* Exploit code maturity in CVSS 3.1 differs from exploit maturity in 4.0.
