SUMMARY
Probe, from the OpenSSF, discusses the EU's CRA, its impact on product security, and open-source software.

IDEAS
* CRA codifies cybersecurity practices into EU law, impacting product security teams.
* CRA requires secure by design, secure by default, and evidence production.
* No known exploitable vulnerabilities allowed in products placed on the EU market.
* ESBOMs must be provided to legal authorities upon request, not publicly.
* Vulnerability remediation and security updates must be provided without delay.
* Upstream engagement is encouraged, including contributing fixes back upstream.
* Support periods must be published, lasting at least five years from last change.
* Charging for security updates is forbidden under the CRA.
* Patches must be accessible for 10 years, even if not on a public website.
* Regular product testing and review is required, with evidence upon request.
* A coordinated vulnerability disclosure policy is required for compliance.
* A single point of contact for the company is required by the CRA.
* Actively exploited vulnerabilities must be reported within 24 hours to ENISA.
* Security advisories for actively exploited vulnerabilities due within 72 hours.
* Severe incidents impacting product security must be reported to ENISA.
* Early warning of severe incidents due within 24 hours, with updates at 72 hours.
* Secure update distribution is required, ensuring verification and no tampering.
* Open-source components are the manufacturer's responsibility under CRA.
* Effective due diligence on the supply chain is an obligation under CRA.
* Class 1 products require self-attestation, while Class 2 needs third-party validation.
* The CRA aims to protect consumers, not solely focus on security.
* The CRA was initially driven by a desire to regulate IoT devices.
* Upstream open source projects are not obligated under the CRA.
* Manufacturers own the security of all components, including open source.
* Collaboration and engagement with upstream projects are crucial.
* The expert group influences CRA development, with limited external access.

INSIGHTS
* The CRA shifts responsibility for open-source security to manufacturers.
* Proactive engagement with upstream projects is essential for CRA compliance.
* The CRA's strict timelines necessitate process adjustments for many companies.
* Understanding product usage and data sensitivity is crucial for incident reporting.
* The CRA emphasizes consumer protection, holding manufacturers accountable.
* Collaboration and information sharing are key to navigating CRA complexities.
* The CRA's scope extends beyond security, impacting business practices.
* Building relationships with regulatory bodies can ease compliance.
* The CRA's implementation details are still evolving, requiring ongoing attention.
* The CRA aims to improve overall software security by incentivizing best practices.
