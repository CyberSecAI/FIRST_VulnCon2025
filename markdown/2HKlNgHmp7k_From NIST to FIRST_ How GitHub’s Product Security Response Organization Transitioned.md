* The FIRST PSIRT Services Framework aligns with NIST and enhances product security IR.
* GitHub's bug bounty program is integral to its vulnerability management lifecycle.
* High rewards and gamification incentivize security research and bug reporting.
* Triage involves bug bounty engineers, PERT analysts, and product engineering.
* Remediation includes fixing PRs, product involvement, and retesting by bounty engineers.
* Disclosure involves a long list of stakeholders and requires careful communication strategies.
* Prior art and documented lessons learned inform disclosure decisions.
* Aligning with frameworks simplifies audits and promotes industry-standard language.
* Noise from AI-generated reports is a challenge in vulnerability management.
* Education and clear communication are key to managing expectations around AI in security.
* GitHub uses a combination of NIST, SIM3, and FIRST frameworks for its program.
* GitHub's incident response plan is ingrained in the team's workflow.
* A stakeholder rolodex and service catalog facilitate quick communication.
* GitHub uses GitHub issues for vulnerability tracking and management.
* Cross-training, shadowing, and knowledge dumps are crucial for team development.
* Transparency is a core value in GitHub's vulnerability disclosure process.
* GitHub leverages prior art and experience for consistent communication.
* Documentation is essential for continuous improvement and informed decision-making.
* GitHub's audit team created a generator to streamline the audit process.

INSIGHTS
