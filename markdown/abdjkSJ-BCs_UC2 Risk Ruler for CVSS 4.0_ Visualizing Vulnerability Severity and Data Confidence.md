SUMMARY
Rob, a cyber risk management guru, discusses the UC2 Risk Ruler for CVSS, a tool for visualizing and contextualizing CVSS scores.

IDEAS
* UC2 stands for Uniform Confidence and Certainty, an estimation methodology.
* The UC2 Risk Ruler augments CVSS scores with visualization of precision.
* CVSS scores lack a mechanism to convey the maturity of underlying metrics.
* The Risk Ruler enables more transparent and defensible cybersecurity decisions.
* Improved communication is a key benefit of using the Risk Ruler.
* CVSS4 has four metric groups: Base, Threat, Environmental, and Supplemental.
* The first 11 base metrics are required and set by the vendor.
* Vendors cannot see every customer deployment or predict threat evolution.
* The Risk Ruler aligns with the CVSS Maturity Model, bottom-up.
* Starting with base metrics provides a range of possible CVSS scores.
* Adding threat and environmental metrics refines the score and increases confidence.
* The Risk Ruler allows for translating numeric scores into qualitative bins.
* The highest level of the ruler represents the precise score with decimals.
* The Risk Ruler allows interoperability between quantitative and qualitative measures.
* Ranges in the Risk Ruler can be used in a PERT distribution for min/max.
* Probability distributions from the Risk Ruler can feed into stochastic models.
* A fictitious vulnerability example shows how scores can change with maturity.
* The Risk Ruler visually shows the precision, maturity, and confidence of scores.
* It helps prioritize vulnerabilities and communicate risk to leadership.
* The Risk Ruler can stop at different levels of maturity based on needs.
* The goal is to map numeric scores to qualitative scores consistently.
* The Risk Ruler helps justify the expense of threat and environmental analysis.
* It facilitates discussions about confidence levels needed in CVSS scores.
* The Risk Ruler is a communication tool for discussing vendor scores.
* Adding threat intelligence increases confidence and justifies additional expense.
* The Risk Ruler helps organizations determine the level of confidence they need.
* It enables better financial decisions related to vulnerability management.
* The Risk Ruler provides transparency and helps vendors avoid liability.
* It puts the burden of responsibility on customers for their deployments.
* The Risk Ruler can be used with threat intelligence from open sources.

INSIGHTS
* The UC2 Risk Ruler enhances communication and transparency in cybersecurity.
* It bridges the gap between quantitative CVSS scores and qualitative risk insights.
* The tool helps organizations make more informed and defensible risk decisions.
* It facilitates discussions about the appropriate level of CVSS score maturity.
* The Risk Ruler allows for balancing precision with the cost of data collection.
* It provides a framework for understanding the limitations of vendor-provided scores.
* By visualizing confidence, the tool aids in prioritizing vulnerabilities effectively.
* The Risk Ruler promotes a more nuanced approach to vulnerability management.
* It encourages organizations to tailor risk assessments to their specific context.
* The tool can be used to justify investments in threat intelligence and other data.

QUOTES
* "The objective here is to use this risk ruler as a way to enable more transparent and defensible cyber security decisions." - Rob
* "The risk ruler really shines is it's designed to show very visually the precision maturity and confidence that lays behind those scores." - Rob
* "The whole goal of the risk ruler here is to show how numeric scores can map down in a consistent way to qualitative scores." - Rob
* "It's about the confidence that what the vendor is saying is the same as what you are going to interpret the same vulnerability in situation in your own environment." - Rob
* "It's to help communicate in situations where people don't quite understand why you'd have two scores and how do those relate to one another." - Rob
* "It drives funding discussions as well because to ingest the base score doesn't really cost a whole lot." - Rob
* "It puts the burden back on your customer base to take responsibility for their own deployment." - Rob
* "It gives the lawyers the ability to say, 'Look, yeah, we said it was a medium, but you see here the range.'" - Rob

HABITS
* Rob closes discussions if no one speaks up within eight seconds.
* Rob posts papers and slide decks on Discord and his website.
* Rob makes his work available under a Creative Commons license.
* Rob is available for speaking engagements and presentations.
* Rob encourages discussion and feedback on his work.
* Rob uses visual aids to explain complex concepts.
* Rob simplifies complex topics for broader understanding.
* Rob uses real-world examples to illustrate his points.
* Rob encourages continuous improvement in risk management.
* Rob emphasizes the importance of communication in cybersecurity.

FACTS
* CVSS scores range from 0 to 10.
* The first 11 CVSS metrics are base metrics.
* Vendors set base metrics based on their view of a vulnerability.
* Threat landscapes evolve over time.
* The CVSS Maturity Model has four levels.
* Threat intelligence increases confidence in CVSS scores.
* Environmental metrics consider factors like firewalls.
* Supplemental metrics add further detail to CVSS scores.
* Qualitative bins categorize risk as low, medium, or high.
* Vendors may assign their own criticality ratings to scores.
