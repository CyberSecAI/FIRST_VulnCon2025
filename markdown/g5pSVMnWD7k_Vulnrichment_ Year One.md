SUMMARY
Lindsay and Art discuss Von Richmond (VR) year one, CISA's vulnerability enrichment project, and its design goals.

IDEAS
* VR provides useful data for vulnerability management and leverages existing capabilities.
* CISA uses the SSVC framework to score every new CVE to prioritize responses.
* VR democratizes vulnerability information as a public service for broader benefit.
* Transparency is a core tenet of VR, with a public repository and documentation.
* VR is not an audit capability and does not overwrite CNA information.
* CISA aims for technology that is secure by design and default.
* VR prioritizes technical vulnerability analysis and emerging CVE coverage.
* Non-authoritative enrichment increases costs and decreases quality.
* It's easier to defend answers when the work process is transparent.
* VR serves as an experiment ground for testing at scale.
* Global software naming remains an unsolved problem hindering progress.
* Syntactically correct CPE generation is easy, but semantic meaning is crucial.
* NVD owns the CPE dictionary, creating challenges for VR.
* CPE work distracted from core VR goals and consumed significant time.
* User feedback didn't strongly support the need for CPE inclusion.
* VR stopped providing CPE; now sourced from CNA or NVD.
* CISA and NVD maintain a close working relationship.
* VR team values transparency and continuous evolution.
* Future VR experiments may involve software identifiers or references.
* VR aims to improve vulnerability prioritization and response.
* CISA advocates for CNAs to provide enrichment data at CVE creation.
* VR provides valuable data for decision-making and recommendations.
* Community engagement is crucial for VR's continued development.
* Experimentation mindset is essential for addressing ecosystem challenges.
* VR seeks to enhance vulnerability data accuracy and completeness.
* CISA promotes collaboration and information sharing across government.
* VR leverages historical context and expertise for continuous improvement.
* CISA's mission is to reduce vulnerability impact across the federal enterprise.

INSIGHTS
* Transparency and community engagement are vital for effective vulnerability management.
* Focusing on core competencies and prioritizing emerging threats yields better results.
* Non-authoritative data enrichment can be detrimental to quality and efficiency.
* Experimentation and data-driven decisions are key to continuous improvement.
* Solving global software naming is crucial for advancing cybersecurity.
* Semantic accuracy is more important than syntactic correctness in CPE.
* Collaboration and information sharing are essential for addressing vulnerabilities.
* Providing enrichment data at the source streamlines vulnerability management.
* Showing your work enhances transparency and defensibility of decisions.
* CISA's mission is to reduce vulnerability impact across various sectors.

QUOTES
* "Our mission is to reduce the prevalence and impact of vulnerabilities across the federal enterprise." - Lindsay
* "We might not care about your internet-connected dishwashers." - Lindsay
* "We care about a lot of things." - Lindsay
* "Our responsibilities can sometimes feel like everything everywhere all at once." - Lindsay
* "We wanted to leverage those existing capabilities." - Lindsay
* "It was really important to us to stay transparent." - Lindsay
* "If someone wants to argue about CVSS, I will argue with you." - Art
* "We're not going to have an accuracy fight." - Art
* "The CNA says X. That's what goes in. VR enrichment steps aside." - Art
* "Engaging in these CVSS and CWE and CPE fights is kind of a waste of almost everyone's time." - Art
* "It's that thing, you know, you've got a great URL that's obvious and one click away from putting in there and helping people." - Art
* "Globally naming software is completely unsolved and it's holding us all back." - Art
* "Anybody can in this room can generate syntactically correct CPE." - Art
* "Syntactically correct? Does it mean anything?" - Art
* "Nonauthoritative enrichment pushes the cost of enrichment up and the quality down." - Lindsay
* "It's a lot easier to defend your answer when you show your work." - Lindsay
* "We want to see continued community engagement." - Lindsay
* "The team behind vulnerrichment believes very strongly in both the core tenants of transparency and also continuing to evolve and try new things." - Lindsay

HABITS
* Drinks coffee while reading to kids.
* Uses Mastodon for communication and monitoring.
* Responds to issues and pull requests on GitHub, even on Sundays.
* Conducts analysis and uses scripts to check for data discrepancies.
* Regularly meets with NIST NVD team for collaboration and updates.
* Experiments with new approaches and technologies in vulnerability management.
* Prioritizes transparency and open communication in project development.
* Leverages historical context and expertise for informed decision-making.
* Focuses on core competencies and avoids distractions from primary goals.
* Engages with the community for feedback and continuous improvement.

FACTS
* CISA uses the SSVC framework to score new CVEs.
* CISA has done coordinated vulnerability disclosure for over a decade.
* CISA's first official CVD advisory was around 2010-2012.
* CISA cares about federal, state, local, tribal, and territorial governments.
* CISA cares about critical infrastructure partners in public and private sectors.
* CISA uses a public repository for vulnerability enrichment.
* CISA provides vulnerability advisories in CESAF format.
* Federal civilian executive branch agencies are held accountable through BOD 22-01.
* The CVE program encourages CNAs to provide enrichment data.
* NVD owns a dictionary of CPEs.
* The CVE record format now fully supports CPE.
* Some high CVSS-scored vulnerabilities never end up in KEV.
