* "My hope as CWE technical lead is to be able to lead CWE content development in a way that balances usability with technical excellence." - Steve Christie
* "Our audience has evolved over the years...from a really highly technical, highly specialized audience...to novice CWE users." - Steve Christie
* "Every vulnerability is a unique snowflake, especially when it comes down to the specific code underneath." - Katie Moussouris
* "CWE weaknesses really are organized around behaviors...what does the product do wrong that introduces vulnerabilities." - Steve Christie
* "You really can't map to the best CWE if you just don't clearly understand the weakness." - Steve Christie
* "We do believe that CNAs, especially developers, really are best positioned to perform the most accurate, precise CWE mappings." - Steve Christie
* "We want to really help CNAs and other people who are doing weakness mapping...find the most accurate and precise mappings." - Steve Christie
* "We have a lot of CWE entries that are really, you know, pretty much okay to use for mapping." - Steve Christie
* "People have limited time or limited expertise to do mapping, and there are often conflicting goals." - Steve Christie
* "Transitions from CVSS version one to version two and then two to version three. You always lose something a little bit in the translation." - Steve Christie
* "Theory is hard to teach without teaching people about more specific examples." - Steve Christie
* "A lot of new technologies...have more or less the same weaknesses, but it's just not recognizable as such." - Steve Christie
* "What quality expectations should the general public have?" - Steve Christie
* "Do not try and force a mapping to a lower level CWE just because it's kind of close." - Steve Christie
* "The more that we can grow CWE and fill in some of these gaps...the less frequently that kind of challenge will show up." - Steve Christie

FACTS
* CWE is almost 20 years old, originating from a proposal paper in late 2005.
* CWE has evolved its focus to include vulnerability management staff and CVE publishers.
* CWE supports multiple views, including research, comprehensive, hardware, and developer views.
* CWE IDs are a flat numeric space, with structure captured in hierarchical views.
* CWE includes over 900+ weaknesses as of version 4.17.
* CWE mapping usage recommendations provide guidance on appropriate CWE usage.
* Many vulnerabilities can be addressed by multiple different mitigations.
* The address sanitizer tool often reports stack overflows related to excessive consumption.
* The phrase "classic overflow" emerged in the mid-to-late 2000s.
