SUMMARY
Kyling Ranahan and Alex Asante discuss operational technology (OT) vulnerability management, highlighting its unique challenges and the importance of compliance.

IDEAS
* Operational technology prioritizes safety, reliability, and performance over confidentiality.
* OT environments are diverse, with many vendors and operating systems on fewer assets.
* End-of-life and legacy systems are common in OT due to long lifecycles and lack of replacements.
* OT devices prioritize functionality over security, often lacking basic security controls.
* Geographical dispersion makes manual patching a significant challenge in OT.
* Availability is crucial in OT, as outages can lead to substantial financial losses.
* Compliance doesn't equal security, and regulations often lag behind evolving cyber threats.
* Nerk CIP standards address various aspects of OT security, with SIP 7 focusing on patching.
* Patching in OT is complex, with strict timelines and limited outage windows.
* Vendor security advisories are crucial for OT vulnerability management.
* CESAP offers a standardized, machine-readable format for security advisories.
* OT requires a proactive approach to vulnerability management, not just reactive patching.
* Consider operational limitations when developing and implementing OT security solutions.
* Regulations are often driven by past incidents, so proactive security is essential.
* Collaboration between vendors and customers is crucial for effective OT security.
* Data quality issues, like missing or inaccurate CPEs, hinder vulnerability management.
* Complex data relationships between CVEs, patches, and advisories complicate analysis.
* Mitigation information is crucial in OT, where patching isn't always feasible.
* Security startups face challenges gaining traction in the OT space.
* Legacy systems can create security vulnerabilities when integrated with newer technologies.
* Proper segmentation and access control are essential for mitigating OT risks.
* Test networks in OT are often limited due to the diversity and complexity of devices.
* OT customers have more power than they realize and should advocate for better security.

INSIGHTS
* OT security requires a different mindset, prioritizing availability and safety.
* Legacy systems and diverse environments make OT vulnerability management complex.
* Compliance is necessary but insufficient for robust OT security.
* Collaboration and data quality are key to effective vulnerability management.
* Proactive security measures are crucial to prevent incidents and future regulations.
* Balancing security with operational needs is a constant challenge in OT.
* Patching in OT is more complex than in IT, requiring careful planning and execution.
* Standardized formats like CESAP can improve automation and efficiency.
* OT customers should leverage their influence to drive vendor security improvements.
* Understanding the unique challenges of OT is essential for effective security.

QUOTES
* "When these systems are built, you're not considering necessarily your CIA triad. You're considering safety, reliability, and performance." - Kyling Ranahan
* "The priority of utility is a little bit different...the first priority is going to be operations and reliability." - Alex Asante
* "Security is key and important, but it's a balance...managing the risks and not chasing perfection." - Alex Asante
* "Compliance, regulation, security can be a little bit different. We change our perspectives here." - Alex Asante
* "Remember compliance does not equal security, and security does not equal compliance." - Alex Asante
* "Regulatory standards and cyber threats are always evolving, and that's definitely not always in parallel." - Alex Asante
* "Knowing that a vulnerability is a buffer overflow does not really give you a lot of helpful information about what to do about it." - Kyling Ranahan
* "Vendor security advisories...this is what we use most frequently to determine what is applicable to a system." - Kyling Ranahan
* "CESAP...is quite literally revolutionary when we go into these operational environments." - Kyling Ranahan
* "Consider the operational limitations. It's not that you have to change everything to cater to them, but things are different." - Kyling Ranahan
* "The future of regulation is written by today's vulnerabilities. It takes one incident to become regulated." - Alex Asante
* "There's a lot of screenshots being used as compliance evidence." - Kyling Ranahan
* "There comes a point where that is the only recommendation that I could reasonably give to you." - Kyling Ranahan
* "If you have a mitigation from the vendor for a vulnerability, great. Easy." - Kyling Ranahan
* "There's a level of risk that, especially with these older systems, you may have to accept." - Kyling Ranahan
* "Test networks in OT...truly only have most critical assets." - Alex Asante
* "Don't underestimate that ESI release a technical guideline...vendors have to comply with." - Alex Asante
* "Vendors want to work with you, you should want to work with the vendors." - Alex Asante
* "You have power, you have importance, right? Just because there's not many [of you] doesn't mean you're not important." - Alex Asante

HABITS
* Prioritize safety, reliability, and performance in system design and operation.
* Maintain detailed asset inventories and robust asset management systems.
* Evaluate security patches for applicability before deployment.
* Develop mitigation plans for vulnerabilities that cannot be patched.
* Implement proper segmentation and access controls to limit risk.
* Stay informed about evolving cyber threats and regulatory standards.
* Collaborate with vendors to address security concerns and obtain necessary data.
* Document security practices and maintain records for compliance audits.
* Use standardized formats like CESAP to improve automation and efficiency.
* Take screenshots of vendor advisories as evidence of compliance checks.
* Consider long-term lifecycle implications when selecting OT hardware and software.
* Advocate for better security practices from vendors, leveraging customer power.
* Develop and maintain a proactive vulnerability management program.
* Prioritize availability and minimize outage windows during patching.
* Use both software emulation and physical labs for vulnerability research.

FACTS
* The 2003 Northeast blackout led to the development of NERC CIP standards.
* The Colonial Pipeline ransomware attack prompted TSA security directives.
* NERC CIP standards cover various aspects of OT security, including patching.
* SIP 7 is the most important NERC CIP standard for ongoing vulnerability management.
* R2 patching is the most commonly violated NERC CIP requirement.
* Patching timelines in NERC CIP are strict, with 35 days for evaluation and 35 days for deployment.
* Many OT environments use legacy systems like Windows XP and even older operating systems.
* OT devices often lack basic security controls like strong passwords and certificates.
* CESAP is a JSON schema for creating and sharing vendor security advisories.
* A small percentage of vendors currently provide advisories in CESAP format.
* OT systems often rely on timed network requests and responses for operation.
* Some vendor advisories are only accessible behind logins or paywalls.
* Career spans in the OT industry are long, leading to knowledge gaps in cybersecurity.
* The North American Transmission Forum (NATF) has a comprehensive vendor questionnaire.
